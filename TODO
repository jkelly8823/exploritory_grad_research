Some cve/wild samples are too long. Trim down or split up files?

My next steps-
Run the full datasets through models, keep the models blind
Run the vuln samples through models, then run patches asking if the patches "fixed the vulns"
Run the tests with various prompts, and experiment with prompt chaining
Try giving the model some samples as background context, then evaluate it on separate samples to see if it improves efficacy
