render :edit
render action: :edit
render "edit"
render action: "edit"
render "books/edit"
render template: "books/edit"
```

Which one you use is really a matter of style and convention, but the rule of thumb is to use the simplest one that makes sense for the code you are writing.

By default, Rails will serve the results of a rendering operation with the MIME content-type of `text/html` (or `application/json` if you use the `:json` option, or `application/xml` for the `:xml` option.). There are times when you might like to change this, and you can do so by setting the `:content_type` option:

```ruby
render template: "feed", content_type: "application/rss"
```
