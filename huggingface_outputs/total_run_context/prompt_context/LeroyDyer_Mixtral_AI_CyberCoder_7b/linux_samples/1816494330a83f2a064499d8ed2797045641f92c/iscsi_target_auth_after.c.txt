VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-18
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the chap_server_compute_md5() function due to the lack of bounds checking on the input parameters. The function does not check the length of the input strings, which can lead to a stack buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the system.
