EXPLANATION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the chap_server_compute_md5() function. The function calls hex2bin() and chap_string_to_hex() which can lead to a stack buffer overflow. The function does not check the input length, allowing an attacker to pass a malicious input to the function, which can
