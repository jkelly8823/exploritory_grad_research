EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a data leak due to the use of memcpy() function which copies data from the user space to kernel space without proper bounds checking. This could lead to a potential kernel data leak. The function sctp_get_sctp_info() is known to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
