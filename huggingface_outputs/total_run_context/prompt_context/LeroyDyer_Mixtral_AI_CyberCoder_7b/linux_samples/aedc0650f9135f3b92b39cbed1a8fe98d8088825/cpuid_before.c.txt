VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel's handling of the KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID ioctl request. The function call to do_host_cpuid() is not checked for input validation, allowing a user or process to pass an invalid value for the nent parameter, which can lead
