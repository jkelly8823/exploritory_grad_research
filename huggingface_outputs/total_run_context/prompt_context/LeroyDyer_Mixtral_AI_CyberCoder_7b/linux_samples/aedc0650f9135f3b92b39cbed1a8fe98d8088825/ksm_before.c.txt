VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the mm_slot variable. An attacker could potentially overwrite memory beyond the allocated space, leading to a stack smash or memory corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add bounds checking to ensure that the mm_slot variable is
