VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the xfs_alloc_file_space function, where the function call to xfs_bmapi_write() does not check the alignment of the requested allocation size. An attacker could potentially exploit this function to allocate a file size that is not aligned, leading to a data leak
