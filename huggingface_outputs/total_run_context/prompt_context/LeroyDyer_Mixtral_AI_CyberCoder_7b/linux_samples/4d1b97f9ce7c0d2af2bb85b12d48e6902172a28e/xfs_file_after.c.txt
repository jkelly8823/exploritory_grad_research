VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the xfs_alloc_file_space function, where the function call to xfs_alloc_file_space is made without checking the return value. If the function call fails, the code continues execution without checking the error, which could lead to a data leak. The attacker could potentially
