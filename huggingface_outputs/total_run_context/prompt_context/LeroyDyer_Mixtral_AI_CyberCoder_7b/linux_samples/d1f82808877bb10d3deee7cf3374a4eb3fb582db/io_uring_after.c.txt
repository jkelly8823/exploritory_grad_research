VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem of the Linux kernel, where the MAX_RW_COUNT limit can be bypassed by using negative values for the len parameter in the io_uring_add_buffer() function. This could lead to a heap overflow and arbitrary code execution in the kernel. The vulner
