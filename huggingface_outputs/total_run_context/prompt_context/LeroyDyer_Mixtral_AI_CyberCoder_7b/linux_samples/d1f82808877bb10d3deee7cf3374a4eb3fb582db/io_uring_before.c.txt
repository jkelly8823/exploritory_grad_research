VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem of the Linux kernel, where the MAX_RW_COUNT limit can be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, allowing negative values to be used in mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could lead to a heap
