VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the second interrupt-in endpoint descriptor is present before allocating memory for the private structure. If the descriptor is not present, it prints an error message and returns an error. However, if the descriptor is present, it uses the descriptor to initialize the private structure. This is a potential vulnerability as it does not check for NULL
