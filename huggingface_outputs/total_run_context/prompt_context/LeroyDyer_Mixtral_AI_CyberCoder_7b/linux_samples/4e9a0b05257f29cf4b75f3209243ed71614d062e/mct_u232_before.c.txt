EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory for the priv variable using kzalloc() which is a function that zeros the memory. However, it does not check if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, it returns -ENOMEM. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the priv variable later in the function.
