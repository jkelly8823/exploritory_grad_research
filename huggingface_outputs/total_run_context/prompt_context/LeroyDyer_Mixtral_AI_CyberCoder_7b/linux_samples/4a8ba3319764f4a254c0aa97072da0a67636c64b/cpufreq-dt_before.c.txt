EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel. The lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions can allow guest OS users to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer and crashing the host OS. To mitigate this, the decoder
