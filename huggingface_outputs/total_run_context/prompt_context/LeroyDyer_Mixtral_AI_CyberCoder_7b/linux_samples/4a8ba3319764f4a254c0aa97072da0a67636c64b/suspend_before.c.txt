VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 118-121
EXPLANATION:
The code sample shows a function call to cpu_switch_mm() which is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. The function call can lead to a denial of service and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. To mitigate this vulnerability, the decoder
