VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code sample contains a function call to a module that is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This can lead to a denial of service attack. To mitigate this vulnerability, the decoder-table flags should be added to ensure proper handling
