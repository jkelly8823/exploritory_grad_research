VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the ACPI device is present before attempting to access the device's power state. However, it does not check if the device is valid before accessing the device's power state, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a potential denial of service attack. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should
