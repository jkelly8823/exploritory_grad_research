VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It is checking if exynos_drm_pdev is not NULL before returning an error code. This is a good practice to prevent NULL pointer dereference.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code looks secure, but it is recommended to add checks for NULL pointer values throughout the function to ensure robustness.
