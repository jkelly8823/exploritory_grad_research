VULNERABLE_LINES: 118-120
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a function call to a pointer array without bounds checking, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a potential crash. The function call is not checked for NULL values, which can be exploited by a malicious user to cause a denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking
