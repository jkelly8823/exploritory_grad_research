VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It is a list of board names and a macro definition for the OMAP3 and OMAP3 architectures. The absence of a specific instruction decoder table does not indicate a vulnerability in itself, as it is a deliberate design choice. However, it is important to note that the lack of certain decoder flags could potentially introduce security issues if the code
