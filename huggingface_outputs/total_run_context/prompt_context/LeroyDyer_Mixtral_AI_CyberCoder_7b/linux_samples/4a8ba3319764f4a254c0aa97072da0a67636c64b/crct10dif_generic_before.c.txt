VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code sample contains a function call to a module that is known to be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a denial of service and host OS crash. The function call is not properly checked for valid input, allowing a crafted application to pass a NULL pointer to the function, causing a vulnerability.
