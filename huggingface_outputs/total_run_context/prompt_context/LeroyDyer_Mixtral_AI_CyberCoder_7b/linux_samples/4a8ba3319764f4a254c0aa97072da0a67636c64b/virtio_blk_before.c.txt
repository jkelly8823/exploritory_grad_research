EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel. The lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions can allow guest OS users to cause a denial of service by triggering a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash. To mitigate this
