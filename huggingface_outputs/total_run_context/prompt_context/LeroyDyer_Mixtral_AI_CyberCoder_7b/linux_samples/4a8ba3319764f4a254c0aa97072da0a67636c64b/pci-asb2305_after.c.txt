VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the flags and start pointer are not NULL before accessing the resource, but it does not check if the resource is allocated. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a crash if the resource allocation fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that the resource is allocated before accessing it.
