VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a lack of proper handling of event constraints for the Intel processor, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a denial of service vulnerability. The lack of proper checks and bounds can result in a crash of the host OS.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement proper checks and bounds for event constraints to prevent
