VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 114-118
EXPLANATION: The code sample contains a function that decodes the SHA1 hash algorithm, which is known to be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This can lead to a denial of service attack. To mitigate this vulnerability, the
