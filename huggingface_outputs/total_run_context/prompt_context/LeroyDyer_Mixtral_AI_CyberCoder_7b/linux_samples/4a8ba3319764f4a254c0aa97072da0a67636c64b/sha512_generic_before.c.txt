VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 118-120
EXPLANATION: The code sample contains a function that decodes the SHA-512 and SHA-384 cryptographic algorithms, but it does not include checks for NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a denial of service attack by guest OS users. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should include checks for NULL pointers before
