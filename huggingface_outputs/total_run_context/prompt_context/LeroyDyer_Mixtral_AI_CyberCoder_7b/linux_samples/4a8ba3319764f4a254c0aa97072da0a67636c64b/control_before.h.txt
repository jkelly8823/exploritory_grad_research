EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a definition of constants, but it does not include a check for the presence of the intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which could allow a guest OS user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer and crashing the host OS. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code
