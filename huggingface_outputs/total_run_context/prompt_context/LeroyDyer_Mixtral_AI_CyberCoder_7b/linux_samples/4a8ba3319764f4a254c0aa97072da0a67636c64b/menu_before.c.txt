VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the calculation of measured time for CPU idle state. The code does not check for the exit latency before subtracting it from the measured time, which could lead to incorrect values and inaccurate results. This could potentially cause incorrect estimation of the CPU idle state and affect the overall performance of the
