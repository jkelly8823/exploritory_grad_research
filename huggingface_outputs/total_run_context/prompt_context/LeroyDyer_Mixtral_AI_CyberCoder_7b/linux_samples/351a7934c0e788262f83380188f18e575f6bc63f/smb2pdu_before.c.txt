VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the input values of the MaxTransactSize, MaxReadSize, and MaxWriteSize, which can lead to buffer overflow and memory corruption. It is recommended to validate the input values and implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation and bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks
