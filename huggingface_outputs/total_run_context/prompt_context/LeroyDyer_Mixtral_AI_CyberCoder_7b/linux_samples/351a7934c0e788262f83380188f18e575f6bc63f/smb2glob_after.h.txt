EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the cifs_iovec_write function, which is a function that handles SMB2 write operations. The function does not properly handle uncached write operations, allowing local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, potentially leading to memory corruption and system crashes. To mitigate this, the function
