VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function cifs_get_inode_info is susceptible to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the input parameters. The function call to kstrdup() does not check the length of the input string, which can lead to a
