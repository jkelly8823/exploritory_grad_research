VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it does not check the size of the report before accessing the memory location. An attacker can craft a report with a large size and overwrite the memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a bounds check to ensure that the report size is within the valid range before accessing the memory location
