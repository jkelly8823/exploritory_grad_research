VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it does not check the size of the report before accessing the report array. An attacker can potentially overwrite memory by providing a large report size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a bounds check to ensure that the report size is within the valid range before accessing the report array.
