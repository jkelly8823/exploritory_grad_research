VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the initialization of the random number generator (RNG) in the Linux kernel. The code snippet initializes the random number generator (RNG) before the system has fully booted, which could allow an attacker to access the RNG state before it is properly seeded. This could lead to
