VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3-5
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the size of the input before copying it to the buffer. The input size is compared to the size of the buffer, but the comparison is not done before the copy operation. This can lead to buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a check before copying the data
