VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4, 8, 16
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the use of unsafe functions and variables that can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain root privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use input validation and bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows and use secure coding
