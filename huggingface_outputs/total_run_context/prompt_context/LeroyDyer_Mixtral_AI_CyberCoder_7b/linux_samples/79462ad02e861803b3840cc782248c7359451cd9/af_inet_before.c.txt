VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as it does not validate the protocol identifier before accessing the protocol structure. This can lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation via a crafted SOCK_RAW application. To fix this, the code should check the protocol identifier for validity before accessing the protocol structure.
