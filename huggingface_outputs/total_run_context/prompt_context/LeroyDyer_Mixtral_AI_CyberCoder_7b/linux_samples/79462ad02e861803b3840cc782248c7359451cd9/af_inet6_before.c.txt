VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code does not validate the protocol identifiers, which can lead to a NULL function pointer dereference and system crash. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should perform input validation on the protocol identifiers before calling the lookup_protocol function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation on the protocol identifiers before calling lookup_protocol function.
