VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the kvm_set_msr_common function. The function does not check the alignment of the input data before performing a write operation, which could allow a guest OS user to write beyond the end of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow and potentially corrupting the host OS memory.
