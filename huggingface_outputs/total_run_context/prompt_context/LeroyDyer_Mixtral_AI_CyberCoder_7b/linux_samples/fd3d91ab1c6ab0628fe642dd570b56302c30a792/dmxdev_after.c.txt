VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a use-after-free vulnerability due to a race condition in the mutex locking and unlocking. The mutex lock is not released before the loop is finished, allowing a data race to occur. This can lead to memory corruption and unpredictable behavior.
