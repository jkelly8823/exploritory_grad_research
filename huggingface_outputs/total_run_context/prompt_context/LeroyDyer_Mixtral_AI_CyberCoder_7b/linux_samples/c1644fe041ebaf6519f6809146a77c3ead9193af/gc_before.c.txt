VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function named key_type_dead which is a struct with a name "dead" and a NULL pointer dereference. This is a potential vulnerability as it can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a denial of service. To fix this, the struct should be initialized properly and the NULL pointer should be checked
