VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to NULL pointer dereference as it dereferences a pointer that may be NULL, which can lead to a denial of service and out-of-bounds access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a null check before dereferencing the pointer and add proper error handling to prevent NULL pointer dereference.
