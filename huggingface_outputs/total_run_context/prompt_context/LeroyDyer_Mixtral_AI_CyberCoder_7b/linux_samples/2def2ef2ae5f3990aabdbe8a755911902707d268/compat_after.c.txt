VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the timeout parameter is NULL and if it is not NULL, it calls sys_recvmmsg with MSG_CMSG_COMPAT flag. This function is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack as it allows a user to pass a crafted timeout pointer to the function, which can be exploited to gain root privileges.
