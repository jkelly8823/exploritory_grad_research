VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The memset function is used to clear the memory of the ext4_raw_inode structure, but it does not check the size of the structure, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by a local user to overwrite memory and potentially crash the system.
