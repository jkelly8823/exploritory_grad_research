VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential race condition vulnerability in the snd_seq_write_pool_allocated function. The function checks if snd_seq_write_pool_allocated is true, and if it is not, it proceeds to remove all existing cells from the client->pool. This could lead to a deadlock condition
