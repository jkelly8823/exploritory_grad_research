EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the allocation of memory for the indirect_pages array. The code allocates memory for the indirect_pages array using alloc_page() function, which does not zero the memory before allocating it. This could lead to information leakage as the memory may contain sensitive data from previous allocations. Additionally
