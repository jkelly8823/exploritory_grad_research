VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a struct definition with a char array that is not properly checked for bounds checking, which could allow a buffer overflow vulnerability. The key array has a maximum length of KEY_MAXLEN, which is not checked before use. This could allow a remote attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
