EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a struct definition with a buffer of 64 bytes for the key and 32 bytes for the value, which is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The size of the buffer is too small to safely store the data, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the allocated space, leading to memory corruption and a possible OOP
