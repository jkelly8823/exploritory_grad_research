VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-15
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel that allows attackers to bypass the size restriction on arguments and environment strings by using pointers to large data structures. The code calculates the size of the arguments and environment strings as the entire vma size, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The size calculation is
