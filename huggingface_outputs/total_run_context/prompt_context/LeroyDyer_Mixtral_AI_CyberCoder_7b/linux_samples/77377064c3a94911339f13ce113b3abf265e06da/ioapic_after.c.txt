VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential infinite loop vulnerability in the ioapic_lazy_update_eoi function. The function checks if there are no pending EOIs in the LAPICs and then calls rtc_irq_eoi, which could lead to an infinite loop if the EOI is not properly handled.
