VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the input data before processing it. The input data is directly copied into a buffer without checking its length. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the length of the input data before processing it to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
