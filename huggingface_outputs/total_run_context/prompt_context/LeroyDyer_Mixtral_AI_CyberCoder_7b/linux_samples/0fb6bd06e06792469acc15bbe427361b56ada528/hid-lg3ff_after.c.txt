VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses memset to clear the entire report->field[0] without checking the size of the report->field[0] before clearing it. This can lead to a heap-based out-of-bounds write. The correct approach would be to check the size of report->field[0]
