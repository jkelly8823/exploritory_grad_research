VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of input validation on the report_list and field variables. The code does not check the size of the report_list and field pointers, which could allow an attacker to write arbitrary data to memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation to ensure that the pointers are
