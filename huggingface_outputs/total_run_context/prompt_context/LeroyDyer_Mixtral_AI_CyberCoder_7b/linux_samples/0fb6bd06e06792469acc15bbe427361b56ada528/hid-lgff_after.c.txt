VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the size of the input data before copying it to the buffer. An attacker can craft a malicious report to overwrite the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a buffer of appropriate size to store the report data and validate the input data before copying it
