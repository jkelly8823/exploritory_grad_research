VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential out-of-bounds memory read vulnerability in the function x509_decode_time in x509_cert_parser.c. The function allocates memory for the log->bios_event_log variable using kmalloc, but it does not check if the allocation was successful.
