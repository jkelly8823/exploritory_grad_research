VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a function declaration with a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function ia_css_eed1_8_vmem_encode. The function takes a pointer to a struct as an argument, which can be used to pass a large input value that overflows the buffer, leading to a memory corruption and privilege escalation.
