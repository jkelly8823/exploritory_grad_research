VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 5-7, 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the CEC_TIM_START_BIT_LOW_MIN and CEC_TIM_IDLE_SAMPLE variables, which are hardcoded values. These values are not checked for input validation, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate the
