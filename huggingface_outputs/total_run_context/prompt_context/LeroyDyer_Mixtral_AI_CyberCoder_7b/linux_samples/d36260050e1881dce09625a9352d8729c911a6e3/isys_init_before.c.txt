VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to isys_irqc_status_enable() which is a function that enables interrupts for the specified IRQs. This function is vulnerable to privilege escalation as it does not check the user's privileges before enabling the IRQs, allowing an attacker to potentially gain elevated privileges.
