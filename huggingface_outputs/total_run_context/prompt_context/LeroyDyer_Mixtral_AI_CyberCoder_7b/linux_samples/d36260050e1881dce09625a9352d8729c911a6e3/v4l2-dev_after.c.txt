VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Android kernel, specifically in the vdev->minor = i + minor_offset; line. This line of code could allow an attacker to potentially elevate privileges by exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in the vdev->minor variable, which could lead to privilege escalation
