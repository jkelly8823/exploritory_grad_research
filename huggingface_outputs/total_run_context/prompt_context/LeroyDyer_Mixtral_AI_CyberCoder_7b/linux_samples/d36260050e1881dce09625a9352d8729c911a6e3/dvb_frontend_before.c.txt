VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the dtv_property_process_get function, which can lead to memory corruption and privilege escalation. The function call does not check the size of the input buffer, allowing an attacker to pass a large input value and potentially overwrite memory.
