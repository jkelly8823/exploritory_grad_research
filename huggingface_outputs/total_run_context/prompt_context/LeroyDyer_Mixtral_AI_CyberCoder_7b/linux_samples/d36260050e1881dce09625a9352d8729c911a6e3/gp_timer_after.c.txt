VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows two functions, gp_timer_reg_store and gp_timer_reg_load, which are both static functions. The functions are not declared as const, which means that they can be modified. This can lead to a potential privilege escalation vulnerability as they can be modified by the attacker to execute arbitrary code
