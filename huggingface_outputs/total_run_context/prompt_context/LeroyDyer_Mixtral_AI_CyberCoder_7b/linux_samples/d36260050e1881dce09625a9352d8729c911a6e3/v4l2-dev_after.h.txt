VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the definition of the enum vfl_devnode_type. The last value of the enum is hardcoded as VFL_TYPE_MAX, which is a security risk as it can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code. The correct way to define the last value is to use an explicit
