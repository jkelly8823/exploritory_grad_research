VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the get_user() function, which can lead to a potential stack overflow. The function call to get_user() can read from user space into kernel space without bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overwrite the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code.
