VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10, 13-18
EXPLANATION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a pointer arithmetic on an array index. The array bounds check is not performed before accessing the array element. The index is not checked against the array size. The index is incremented by 1, which can lead to an out-of-
