VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to privilege escalation as it uses devm_clk_get() to acquire the clocks for the jpeg device without checking for errors. If the function returns an error, the function will continue execution without returning an error. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to the device.
