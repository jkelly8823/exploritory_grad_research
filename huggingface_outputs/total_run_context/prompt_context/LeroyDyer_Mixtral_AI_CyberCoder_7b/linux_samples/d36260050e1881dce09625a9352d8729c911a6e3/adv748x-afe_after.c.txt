VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the mutex locking mechanism. The mutex locking is not properly handled, which could lead to a race condition and allow unauthorized access to the mutex.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a more robust locking mechanism such as a semaphore or a mutex with a condition variable to
