EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a switch statement with multiple cases that can lead to a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The switch statement is used to determine the number of bits per subpixel based on the input format. The integer value of the input format is converted to a bit value, which can lead to integer overflows if the input format is not one of
