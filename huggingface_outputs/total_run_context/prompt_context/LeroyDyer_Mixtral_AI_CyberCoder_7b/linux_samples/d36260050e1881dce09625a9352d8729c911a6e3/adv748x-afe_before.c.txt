EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to the use of mutex_lock() which can lead to a race condition. The mutex_lock() function can be used to acquire a mutex lock, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain elevated privileges. To mitigate this, use a more secure locking mechanism such as
