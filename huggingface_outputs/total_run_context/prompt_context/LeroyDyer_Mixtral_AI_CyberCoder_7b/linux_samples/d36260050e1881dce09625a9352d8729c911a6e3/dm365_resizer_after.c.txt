VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function named resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode() which calls another function resizer_configure_in_single_shot_mode() and resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode() without checking the return value of the previous function call. This could lead to a potential security vulnerability
