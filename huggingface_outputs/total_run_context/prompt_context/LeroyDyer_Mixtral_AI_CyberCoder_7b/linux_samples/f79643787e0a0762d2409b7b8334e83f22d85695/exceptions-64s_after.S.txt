VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-11, 13-18
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of unchecked array accesses. The use of unchecked array accesses in the loop can lead to memory corruption and potential buffer overflow. The use of unchecked array accesses can lead to memory corruption and buffer overflow, which can be exploited
