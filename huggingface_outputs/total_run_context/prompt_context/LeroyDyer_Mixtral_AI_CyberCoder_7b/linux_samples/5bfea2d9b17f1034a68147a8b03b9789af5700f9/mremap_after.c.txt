VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the allocation of new_pmd, which is a pointer to a page mapping descriptor. The allocation of new_pmd is not checked for NULL, which could lead to a memory access violation if it is NULL. This could be exploited by a local attacker to escalate privileges on the system
