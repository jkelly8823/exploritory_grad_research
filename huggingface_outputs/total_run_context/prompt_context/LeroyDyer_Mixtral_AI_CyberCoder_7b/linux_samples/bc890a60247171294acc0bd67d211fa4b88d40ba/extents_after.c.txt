VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks the depth of the ext4 filesystem and if it is out of bounds, it calls ext4_ext_drop_refs() function which is vulnerable to an out-of-bound access. This function is known to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The function is called with a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
