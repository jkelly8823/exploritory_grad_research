VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the calculation of the maximum segment size (MSS) for TCP packets. The code does not account for the presence of the TCP SACK option, which can lead to a denial of service attack by allowing a remote peer to fragment packets beyond the expected size. The use of a hardcoded
