VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the default MSS value is hardcoded to 48 bytes, which is a known vulnerability. The default MSS value should be configurable and not hardcoded. This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. The recommended fix is to make the MSS value configurable.
