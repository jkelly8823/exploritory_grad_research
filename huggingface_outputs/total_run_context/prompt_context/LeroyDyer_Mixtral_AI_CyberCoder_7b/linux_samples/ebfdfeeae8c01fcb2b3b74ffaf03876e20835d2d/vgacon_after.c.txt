VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it does not check the size of the input before copying it to the buffer. An attacker can potentially overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a stack smash vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a proper buffer size check before copying data
