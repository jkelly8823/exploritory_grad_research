VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the user has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, but it does not check the origin of the socket. An attacker can use a setuid program to bypass the access control and modify network configurations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement access control based on the origin of the socket to prevent unauthorized access.
