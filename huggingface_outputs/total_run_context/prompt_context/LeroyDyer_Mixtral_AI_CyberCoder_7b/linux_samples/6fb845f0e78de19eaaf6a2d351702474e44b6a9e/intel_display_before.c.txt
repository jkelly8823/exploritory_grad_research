VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks if the encoder has an active connector and an active crtc, and if not, it disables the encoder and connector. This is a safe operation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code looks secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
