VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-15
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel's KVM implementation, where the memory of a freed partition is not properly freed, leading to a use-after-free condition. This could result in memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. The use-after-free condition can be exploited by an attacker to execute
