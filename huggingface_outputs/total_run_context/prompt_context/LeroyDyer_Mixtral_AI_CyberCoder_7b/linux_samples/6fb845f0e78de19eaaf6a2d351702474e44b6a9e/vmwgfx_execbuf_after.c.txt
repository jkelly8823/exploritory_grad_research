VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a memory leak vulnerability due to the use of NULL pointer. The variable p_fence is assigned a NULL value, which can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior. This can be fixed by initializing p_fence to a valid pointer or using a memory allocator to allocate memory for it.
