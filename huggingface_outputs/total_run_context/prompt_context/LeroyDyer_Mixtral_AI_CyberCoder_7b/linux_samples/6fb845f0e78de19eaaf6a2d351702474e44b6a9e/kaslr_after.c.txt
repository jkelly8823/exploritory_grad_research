VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel, where the memory allocated by module_alloc_base is freed but not properly cleaned up, which can lead to memory corruption and unintended behavior. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
