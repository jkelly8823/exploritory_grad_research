VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel's KVM implementation, where the dcache_clean_range function is called twice with different memory ranges. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, as the memory is freed twice. The first call cleans the user space memory, while the second call cleans
