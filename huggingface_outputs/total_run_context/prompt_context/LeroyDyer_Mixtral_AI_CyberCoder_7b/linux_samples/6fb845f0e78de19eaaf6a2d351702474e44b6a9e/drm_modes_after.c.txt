EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability due to the potential for a race condition in the calculation of calc_val. The use-after-free vulnerability can occur if the hsync variable is freed before the calculation is completed, leading to undefined behavior. To mitigate this, the code should ensure that hsync is
