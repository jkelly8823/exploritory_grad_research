VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability, where the skb is freed but the reference count is not updated before the spin_unlock() call, which could lead to a memory leak and a potential memory corruption issue. The correct way to handle this would be to update the reference count before freeing the skb to ensure it
