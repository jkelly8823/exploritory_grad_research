EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the parent pointer is NULL, and if it is not NULL, it continues to iterate through the array of parent pointers. If the parent pointer is not found in the array, it returns an error. However, there is no check for NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. The
