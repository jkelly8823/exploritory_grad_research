VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the function kvm_ioctl_create_device() due to the use of a pointer to a freed memory location. The use of a freed pointer can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption. To fix this, the code should ensure that the pointer is set to NULL after freeing
