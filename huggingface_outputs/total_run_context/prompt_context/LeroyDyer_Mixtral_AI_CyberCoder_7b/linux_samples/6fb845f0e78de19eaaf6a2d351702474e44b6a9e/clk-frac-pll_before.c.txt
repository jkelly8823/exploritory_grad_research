VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability in the variable 'pll' as it is assigned a value and then used later without checking if it is null. This could lead to memory corruption and unintended behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, check if 'pll' is not null before
