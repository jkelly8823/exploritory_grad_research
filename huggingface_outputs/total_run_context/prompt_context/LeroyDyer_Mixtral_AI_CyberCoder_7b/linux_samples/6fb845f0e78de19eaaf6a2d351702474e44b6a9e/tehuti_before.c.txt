VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel's KVM implementation, where the tx_level variable is decremented before freeing the skb_skb, which could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This could result in memory corruption and potential memory leaks. The correct order should be to free the
