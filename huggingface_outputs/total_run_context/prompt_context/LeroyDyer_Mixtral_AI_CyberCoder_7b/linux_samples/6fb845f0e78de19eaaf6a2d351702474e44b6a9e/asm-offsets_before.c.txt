VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code sample shows the offsets of various fields in the task_struct structure. The offsets are hardcoded and not calculated dynamically, which could lead to memory corruption if the structure changes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use dynamic calculation of offsets instead of hardcoded values to ensure compatibility with different architectures and versions of
