VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a function call to mlx5_lag_remove() which is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The function call is not protected by a lock, so the pointer to the struct mlx5_lag *ldev may be freed and then accessed later, leading to undefined behavior.
