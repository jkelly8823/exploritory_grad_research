VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It is checking for an allocation failure and then proceeding with the allocation of memory, which is a good practice. It also uses a loop to clear the GPIO interrupts and status register, which is a good security measure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code looks secure.
