VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel. The free_vpid() function is called to release the resources associated with the virtual processor, but the vmx->nested.vpid02 variable is not guaranteed to be null after this call. An attacker could potentially access the freed memory and read sensitive
