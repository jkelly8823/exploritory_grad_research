EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability, where the pointer to the tx_bufs array is set to NULL after the packet is consumed, but the tx_bufs array is not freed. This could lead to memory corruption and potential memory leaks. To fix this, the tx_bufs array should be
