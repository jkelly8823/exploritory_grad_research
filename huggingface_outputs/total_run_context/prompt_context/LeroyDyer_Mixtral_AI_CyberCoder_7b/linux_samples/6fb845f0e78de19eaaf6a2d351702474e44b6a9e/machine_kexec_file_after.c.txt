VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of vmalloc() which can lead to memory corruption and potential memory leaks. The use of malloc() or calloc() is recommended instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use malloc() or calloc() to allocate memory instead of vmalloc
