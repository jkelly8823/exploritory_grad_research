VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability in the use of the ib_opcode variable. The variable is not properly initialized and may contain a value from a previous execution, which could lead to memory corruption and unintended behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the ib_opcode variable to a known
