VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows an integer overflow vulnerability in the hidp_process_report function. The variable len is assigned a value of HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE if it is greater than the maximum buffer size. This could lead to an out of bounds write, which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the buffer boundary
