VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a memory leak as it does not properly initialize the memory allocated for the vhost_msg_node structure using kmalloc. This can lead to a memory corruption issue and potential memory exhaustion. The use of GFP_KERNEL indicates that the memory is allocated from the kernel heap, which is not freed when the function
