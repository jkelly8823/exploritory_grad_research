EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the user has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before allowing the ioctl call, but it does not check if the user is the device owner. This allows local users to bypass access restrictions and configure econet addresses. The fix would be to add a check for the device owner before allowing the ioctl call
