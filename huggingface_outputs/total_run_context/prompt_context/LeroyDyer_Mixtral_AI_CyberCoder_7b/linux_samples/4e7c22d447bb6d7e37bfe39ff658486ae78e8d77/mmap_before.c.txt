VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability related to the stack randomization feature in the Linux kernel. The use of incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations can make it easier for attackers to predict the address of the top of the stack, bypassing the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection
