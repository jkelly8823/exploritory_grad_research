VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential out-of-bounds memory write vulnerability in the function do_cpuid_func() due to the use of the variable 'nent' which is not checked against the maximum value of 'maxnent'. This could lead to a buffer overflow, resulting in a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack
