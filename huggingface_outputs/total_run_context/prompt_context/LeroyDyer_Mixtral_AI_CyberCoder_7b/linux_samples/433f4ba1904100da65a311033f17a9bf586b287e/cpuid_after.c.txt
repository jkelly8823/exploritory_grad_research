VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the number of arguments is within the allowed range, if not, it returns an error. However, it does not check the input type or bounds of the input. An attacker can pass invalid input to cause a buffer overflow and crash the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should check the input type
