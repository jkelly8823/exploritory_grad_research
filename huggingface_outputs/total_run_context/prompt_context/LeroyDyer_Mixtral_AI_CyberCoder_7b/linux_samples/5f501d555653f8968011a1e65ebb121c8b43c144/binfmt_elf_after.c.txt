VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-15
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the lack of proper handling of ELF_ET_DYN binaries with the MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE flag. The lack of proper handling of the randomization of the load_bias variable could
