VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel that could allow for arbitrary code execution due to the lack of proper handling of ELF_ET_DYN binaries with the PIE flag. The lack of proper handling of the PIE flag in the load_elf_binary() function could lead to a buffer overflow, which could
