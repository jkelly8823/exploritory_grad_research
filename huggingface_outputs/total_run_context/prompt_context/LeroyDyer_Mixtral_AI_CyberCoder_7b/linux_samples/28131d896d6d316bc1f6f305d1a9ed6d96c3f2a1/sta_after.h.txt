VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the different maximum sizes for A-MPDU supported by the device. The lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field can allow an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets, which is a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement authentication of the A-MSDU flag in
