VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the pointer to the public configuration structure is not NULL, but it does not check if the structure is properly initialized. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the pointer is not properly initialized.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Initialize the structure before using it.
