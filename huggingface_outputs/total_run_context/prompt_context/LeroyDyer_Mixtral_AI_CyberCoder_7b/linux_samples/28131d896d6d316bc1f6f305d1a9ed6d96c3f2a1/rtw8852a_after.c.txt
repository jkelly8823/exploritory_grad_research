EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential attack where an adversary can inject arbitrary network packets by exploiting the lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This can lead to unauthorized access to the network. To mitigate this, the code should enforce authentication of the A-MSDU flag for all
