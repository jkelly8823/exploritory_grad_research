VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a memory initialization with all bits set to 0xff, which is a common technique used to mask the MAC address. However, this can be exploited by attackers to discover the original MAC address by sending packets with specific bit manipulations. The function should use a random mask instead of all 0xff to prevent this.
