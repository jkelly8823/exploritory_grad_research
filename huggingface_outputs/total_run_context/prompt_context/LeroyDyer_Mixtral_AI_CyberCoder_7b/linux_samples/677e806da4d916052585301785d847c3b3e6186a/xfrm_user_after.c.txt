VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the input data before using it, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function xfrm_replay_verify_len() does not validate the size of the input data, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
