VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the length of the replay_esn is less than the size of the esn_len, but it does not validate the size of the esn_len against the size of the replay_esn. This could allow an attacker to pass a malicious esn_len value to overwrite the memory
