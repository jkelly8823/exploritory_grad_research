EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the value of arg against the capacity of the CD-ROM device, but the cast from unsigned long to int can lead to integer overflows and underflows, allowing attackers to read kernel memory. The bounds check is not sufficient to prevent memory access beyond the capacity of the device. To fix this, the code
