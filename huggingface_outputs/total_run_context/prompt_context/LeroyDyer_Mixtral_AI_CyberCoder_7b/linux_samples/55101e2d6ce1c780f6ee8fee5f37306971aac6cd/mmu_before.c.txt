VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks the flags and permissions for access control and only allows supervisor writes if the WP bit is not set and the SMTP bit is not set. It does not allow user accesses to execute code. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0155.
