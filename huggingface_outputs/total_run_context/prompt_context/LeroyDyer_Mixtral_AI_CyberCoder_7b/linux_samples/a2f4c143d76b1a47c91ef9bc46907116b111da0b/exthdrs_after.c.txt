VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-18
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the handling of the RPL protocol, where the function checks if the packet size is valid before processing it. If the packet size is not valid, it returns an error code (-1) and frees the packet. However, there is no check for the authenticity of the packet, which could
