VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a function call to memcpy_and_pad() which is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call is not checked for buffer overflow, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function call should be checked for buffer overflow and proper bounds checking should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
