EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value of pmd_alloc() function, which can return NULL if the allocation fails. If pmd_alloc() returns NULL, the code will dereference a NULL pointer, which is undefined behavior. The code should check the return value of pmd_alloc() and handle the case where it returns NULL.
