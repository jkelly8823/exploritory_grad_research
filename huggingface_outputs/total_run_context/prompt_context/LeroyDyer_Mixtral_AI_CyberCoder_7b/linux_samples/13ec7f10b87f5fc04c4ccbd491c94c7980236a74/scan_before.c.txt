VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it copies data from an untrusted source into a buffer without checking the length of the data. The memcpy function does not check the length of the data being copied, which can lead to memory corruption and privilege escalation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer method to copy
