VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the copy_from_user function call. The function call does not check the size of the input data, allowing a malicious user to pass a larger buffer than the size of the LUN_info structure, potentially leading to memory corruption and information leakage.
