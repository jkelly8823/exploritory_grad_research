VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel, where the function convert_ip_to_linear() checks the segment selector value and if it is greater than the size of the user space memory. If the value is greater than the size of the user space memory, it sets the address to -1, which could be used
