VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as it does not check if the priv variable is not NULL before dereferencing it. This could lead to a system crash if the kzalloc() call fails. To fix this, the code should check if priv is not NULL before dereferencing it.
