VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if both interrupt-in and interrupt-out endpoints are present before allocating memory for the cypress_private structure. If either endpoint is missing, an error message is printed and the function returns. This check is not sufficient to prevent a NULL pointer dereference. A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability can occur if the endpoints
