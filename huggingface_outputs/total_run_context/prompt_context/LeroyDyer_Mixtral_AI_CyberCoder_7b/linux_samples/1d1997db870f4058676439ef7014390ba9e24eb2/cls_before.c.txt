VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The code checks for valid input and allocates memory only when necessary, and does not appear to have any memory leaks or other obvious issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code appears to be well-structured and follows good security practices. However, it is important to ensure that all memory is properly freed when no longer needed to prevent potential memory leaks.
