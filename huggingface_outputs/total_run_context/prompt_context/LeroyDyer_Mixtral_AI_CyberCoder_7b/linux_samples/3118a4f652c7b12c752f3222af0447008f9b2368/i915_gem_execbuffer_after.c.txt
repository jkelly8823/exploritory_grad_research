EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow in the variable relocs_total, which can lead to a buffer overflow. The variable relocs_total is incremented with the value of exec[i].relocation_count, which is not checked against the maximum value of INT_MAX. This can cause the variable to exceed its maximum value
