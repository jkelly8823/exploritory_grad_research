EXPLANATION: The code checks if the encryption is enabled by checking the rx_desc_info field, but it does not check the encryption type. This allows for an attacker to potentially inject arbitrary network packets by sending encrypted frames with a valid rx_desc_info value. The code should check the encryption type in addition to the rx_desc_info value to ensure
