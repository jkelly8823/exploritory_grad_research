EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it, but it is not safe to assume that the pointer is always valid. The code should check if the pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it. The correct way to check for NULL pointers is to use a null pointer check before dereferencing.
