VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write, as it dereferences a null pointer in the following statement: report->field[0]->value[2] = &report->field[0]->value[2]; which can lead to a buffer overflow. The fix would be to check for null pointers
