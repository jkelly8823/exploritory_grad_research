VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
EXPLANATION: The code sets the paravirt_enabled variable to 1, which allows guest OS users to bypass ASLR protection by reading a 16-bit value. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel. To fix this, the variable should be set to a random value instead of a constant value.
