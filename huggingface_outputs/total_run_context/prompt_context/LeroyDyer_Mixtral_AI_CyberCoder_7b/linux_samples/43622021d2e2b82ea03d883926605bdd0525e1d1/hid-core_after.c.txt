EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array. The pointer arithmetic operation can lead to memory corruption and heap memory corruption. The use of kzalloc() to allocate memory without bounds checking can lead to memory allocation errors. The
