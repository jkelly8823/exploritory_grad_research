VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the subframe_len against the remaining length of the packet. An attacker can potentially inject arbitrary data into the packet by manipulating the subframe_len variable.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation and bounds checking to ensure that subframe_len is
