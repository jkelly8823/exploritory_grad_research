VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-18
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the function mwifiex_process_country_ie() due to the lack of bounds checking on the input data. The function copies the country_ie data into the bss_desc structure without checking the length of the input data. This could lead to a buffer overflow and a potential stack overflow
