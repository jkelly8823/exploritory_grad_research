VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It is checking the pairwise flag and assigning a unique ID to the key, which is a good security practice. However, it is not clear if the encryption is properly implemented and the key is being rotated regularly. It is recommended to use a secure encryption algorithm and regularly update keys to prevent attacks.
