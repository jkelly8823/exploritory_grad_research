VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code checks that the next fragment has a sequential PN value and copies the last PN from the key to the PN array. This is not a vulnerability as it is a normal part of the WPA2/WPA3 encryption process. The code checks for sequential PNs to ensure data integrity and prevent replay attacks.
