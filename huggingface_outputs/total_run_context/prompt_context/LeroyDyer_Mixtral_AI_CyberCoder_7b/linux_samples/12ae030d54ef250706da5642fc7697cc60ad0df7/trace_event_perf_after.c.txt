VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the user has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, but it does not check if the user is the root user. This means that any user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN can enable function tracing, which is a privilege escalation vulnerability. The fix is to add a check for the user's identity.
