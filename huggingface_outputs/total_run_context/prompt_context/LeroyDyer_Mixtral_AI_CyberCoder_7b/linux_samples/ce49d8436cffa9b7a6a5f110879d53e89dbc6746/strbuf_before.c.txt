VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities due to the use of va_start and va_end. The use of va_start and va_end can lead to format string vulnerabilities as they do not properly handle variable number of arguments. The use of vsnprintf is not sufficient to prevent format string vulnerabilities
