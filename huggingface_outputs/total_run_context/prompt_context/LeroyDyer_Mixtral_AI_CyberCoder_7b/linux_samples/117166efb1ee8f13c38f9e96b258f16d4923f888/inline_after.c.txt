VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of memcpy() function which copies data from an untrusted source into a buffer without proper bounds checking. The function call can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of is.s.here->e_value_size is larger than the size of the buffer.
