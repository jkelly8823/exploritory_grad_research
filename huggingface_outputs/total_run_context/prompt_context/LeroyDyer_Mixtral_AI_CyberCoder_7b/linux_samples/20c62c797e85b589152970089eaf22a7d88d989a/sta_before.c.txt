VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to privilege escalation as it does not check the return value of lockdep_assert_held() and the tid value. An attacker could potentially exploit this to gain elevated privileges.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check to ensure that the lockdep_assert_held() returns successfully before proceeding
