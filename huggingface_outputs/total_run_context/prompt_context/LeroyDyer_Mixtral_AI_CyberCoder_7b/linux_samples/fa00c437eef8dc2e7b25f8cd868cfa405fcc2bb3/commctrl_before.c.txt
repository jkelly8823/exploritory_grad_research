VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition where a local user can cause a denial of service by changing the size value to an invalid value, leading to out-of-bounds access and system crash. The code does not check the size value before accessing the memory, allowing a malicious user to overwrite memory and potentially crash the system.
