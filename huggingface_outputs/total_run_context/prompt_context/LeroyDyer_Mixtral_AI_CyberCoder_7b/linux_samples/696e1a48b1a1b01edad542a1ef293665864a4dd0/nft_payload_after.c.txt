VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the input data before copying it to dst_u8. The input data is copied without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow. To fix this, the code should include input validation and bounds checking before copying the data to dst_u8.
