VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows, as the driver does not check the value of 'pixclock' before performing a division operation. This could lead to a divide by zero error, which could cause a security vulnerability. To fix this, the driver should perform input validation to ensure that 'pixclock' is not zero before performing the
