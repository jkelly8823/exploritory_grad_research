VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for the dev_info structure using kmalloc, but it does not check the return value of the function. If kmalloc fails, it will return NULL, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a potential memory corruption. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
