VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the connection is in the SMP state and if not, it creates a new SMP channel. This is a potential vulnerability as it does not check for the validity of the request and can be exploited by an attacker to send a malicious message to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation
