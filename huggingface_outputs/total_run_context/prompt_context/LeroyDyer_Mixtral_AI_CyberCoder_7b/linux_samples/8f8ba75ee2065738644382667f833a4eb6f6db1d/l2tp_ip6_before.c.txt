VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the lack of input validation on the peer_conn_id variable. The absence of input validation could allow an attacker to potentially manipulate the value of lsa->l2tp_conn_id, which could lead to unintended behavior or privilege escalation.
