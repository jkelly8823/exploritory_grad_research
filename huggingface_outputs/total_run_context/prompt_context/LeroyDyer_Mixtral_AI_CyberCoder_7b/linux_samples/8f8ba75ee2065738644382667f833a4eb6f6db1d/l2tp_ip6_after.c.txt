VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the lsa->l2tp_family, lsa->l2tp_scope_id, and lsa->l2tp_conn_id variables. The absence of bounds checking could allow an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the
