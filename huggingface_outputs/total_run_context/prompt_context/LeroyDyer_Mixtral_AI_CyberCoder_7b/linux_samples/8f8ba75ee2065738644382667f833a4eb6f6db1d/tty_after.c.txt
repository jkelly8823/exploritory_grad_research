VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for the dev_info structure using kzalloc(), which does not initialize the memory to zero. This can lead to information leakage if the memory is not properly initialized, allowing an attacker to potentially access sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use memset() to initialize the memory to zero before allocating
