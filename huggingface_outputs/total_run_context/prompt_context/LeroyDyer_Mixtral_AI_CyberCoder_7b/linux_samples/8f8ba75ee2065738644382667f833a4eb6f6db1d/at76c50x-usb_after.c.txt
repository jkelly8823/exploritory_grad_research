VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the input buffer. The function call to usb_control_msg() does not check the size of the input buffer, which could allow an attacker to pass a larger payload than the expected size, leading to a buffer overflow.
