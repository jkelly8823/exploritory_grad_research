VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the cda array. The function call to nla_parse_nested() does not check the size of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the size of the cda array.
