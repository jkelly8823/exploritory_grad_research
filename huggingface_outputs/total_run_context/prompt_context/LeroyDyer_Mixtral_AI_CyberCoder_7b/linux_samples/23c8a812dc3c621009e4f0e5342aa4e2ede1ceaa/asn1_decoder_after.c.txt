VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow in the variable len. The variable len is assigned the value of the byte following the length byte, which is then shifted left by 8 bits for each subsequent byte. This can lead to integer overflow if the length is greater than 255, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary
