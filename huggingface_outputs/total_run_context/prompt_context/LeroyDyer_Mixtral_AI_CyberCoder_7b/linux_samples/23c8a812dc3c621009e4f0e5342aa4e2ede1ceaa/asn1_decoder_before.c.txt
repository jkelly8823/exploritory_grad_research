VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow in the calculation of the length variable. The integer value is shifted left by 8 bits for each byte read, but the maximum value of a signed char is 127, so if the length is greater than 127, the result will overflow and wrap around to a negative value. This can
