VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the key index is within the valid range, if not, it drops the frame. However, it does not check the frame type. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious beacon frame with an invalid key index, causing a NULL pointer dereference and a denial of service attack.
