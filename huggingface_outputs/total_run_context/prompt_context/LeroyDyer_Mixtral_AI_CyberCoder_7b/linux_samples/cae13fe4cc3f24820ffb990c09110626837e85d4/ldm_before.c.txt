VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of the list_add_tail() function which does not check the size of the list_add_tail() function's argument. An attacker can potentially overwrite memory beyond the end of the heap buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
