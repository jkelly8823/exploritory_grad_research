VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write, as it allocates memory using kzalloc() without checking the return value. If the allocation fails, the program will continue execution, which can lead to undefined behavior and a potential crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use kmalloc() instead of kzalloc
