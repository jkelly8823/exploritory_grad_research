EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the maximum number of physical memory pages that can be allocated for each memory zone. It uses bit shifting to calculate the maximum number of pages for each zone, which could potentially lead to integer overflows if the input values are not carefully checked. This could allow an attacker to access memory outside of the intended zone, leading to a
