VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to a function that is not properly checked for input validation, which could potentially allow unrelated processes to access memory above 512 TB, leading to a memory corruption vulnerability. The function call should be checked for valid input and access control should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access.
