EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a check for the length of the smb header being less than the size of the smb header, which could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read. This could allow a local attacker to read arbitrary memory locations, which could be exploited to crash the system or leak internal kernel information. To mitigate
