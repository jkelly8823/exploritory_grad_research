VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks for valid input parameters and performs bounds checking on the input data. The only potential issue is the comment "FIXME: Add bandwidth and g200se limitations" which is not a vulnerability but a reminder to add additional checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add checks for valid input and bounds checking
