VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as it does not check if the saddr pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check before dereferencing the saddr pointer to prevent the vulnerability.
