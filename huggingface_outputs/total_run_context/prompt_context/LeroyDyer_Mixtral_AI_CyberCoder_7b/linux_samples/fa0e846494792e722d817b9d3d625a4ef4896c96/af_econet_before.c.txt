VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as the variable saddr may be NULL, which can lead to a denial of service and OOPS. To fix this, the code should check for NULL pointer before dereferencing the address and set a default value for saddr if it is NULL.
