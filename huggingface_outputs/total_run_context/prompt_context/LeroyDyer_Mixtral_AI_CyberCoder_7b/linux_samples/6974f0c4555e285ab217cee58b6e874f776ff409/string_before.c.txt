VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to strreplace, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The function call does not include bounds checking or input validation, allowing an attacker to pass a large input string that overflows the buffer and execute code in memory.
