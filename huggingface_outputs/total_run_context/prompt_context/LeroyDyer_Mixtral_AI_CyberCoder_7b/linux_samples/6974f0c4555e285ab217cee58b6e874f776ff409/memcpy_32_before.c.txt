EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the size of the input data before copying it to the destination buffer. This can lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer boundary, potentially causing a stack or heap buffer overflow. To fix this, the code should include a check on the size of the input data and use a safe
