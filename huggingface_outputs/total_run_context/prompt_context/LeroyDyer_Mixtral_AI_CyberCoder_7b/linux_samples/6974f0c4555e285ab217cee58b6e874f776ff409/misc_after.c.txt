VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the debug_putstr function which does not check the length of the input string. The function call to error() does not include a length check, allowing an attacker to pass a long string to the function and potentially overwrite memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function
