VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function that checks if the debugger is connected and if so, it continues execution. This is a vulnerability as it allows an attacker to trigger the debugger and potentially gain access to kernel memory, which can lead to privilege escalation and data leakage. The code should be modified to restrict debugger access during
