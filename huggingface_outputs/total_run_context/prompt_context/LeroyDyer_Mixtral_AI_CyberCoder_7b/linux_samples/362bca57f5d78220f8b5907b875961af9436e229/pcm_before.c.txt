VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a use-after-free vulnerability in the snd_pcm_info function, where the mutex is unlocked before checking the return value of snd_pcm_info_user. This can allow an attacker to gain privileged access to the system by exploiting the memory corruption caused by the use-after-
