VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the format string vulnerability in the BT_DBG function call. The format string is not checked for correctness, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite the stack and cause a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe format string or sanitize input to prevent buffer overflow.
