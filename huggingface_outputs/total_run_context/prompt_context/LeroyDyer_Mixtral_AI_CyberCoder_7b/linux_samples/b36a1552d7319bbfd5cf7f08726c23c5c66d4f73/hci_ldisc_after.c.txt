VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the underlying device or tty has the required operations to support flow control. If the device does not support flow control, the function sets flow control. This is a potential vulnerability as it does not check for the correctness of the input parameters, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate the function call and cause a system crash
