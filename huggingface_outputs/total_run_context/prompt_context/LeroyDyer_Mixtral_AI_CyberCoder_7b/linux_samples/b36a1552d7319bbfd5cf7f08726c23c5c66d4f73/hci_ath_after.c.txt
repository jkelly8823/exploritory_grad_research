VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the format string vulnerability in the BT_DBG function call. The format string "%p" can be exploited by an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack, leading to a potential stack buffer overflow. The use of kzalloc() is not sufficient to prevent this vulnerability.
