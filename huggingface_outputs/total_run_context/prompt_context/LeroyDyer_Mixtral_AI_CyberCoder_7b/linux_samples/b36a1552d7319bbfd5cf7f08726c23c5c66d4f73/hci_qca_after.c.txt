VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of input validation on the input string passed to the BT_DBG function. The function call does not check the length of the input string, allowing an attacker to pass a large input string that can be used to overwrite the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code.
