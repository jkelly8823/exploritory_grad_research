VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability in the ext4_insert_block() function. The variable is_dx_block is assigned a value of 0, which indicates that the block is not allocated. However, the code continues to access the block pointer bh, which is dereferenced later in the
