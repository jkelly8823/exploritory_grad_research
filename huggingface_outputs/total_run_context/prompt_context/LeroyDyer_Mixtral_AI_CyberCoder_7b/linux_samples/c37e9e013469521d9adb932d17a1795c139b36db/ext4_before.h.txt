VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the input ino is within the valid range of inodes for the ext4 filesystem. However, it does not check for the validity of the superblock pointer. An attacker can potentially pass an invalid superblock pointer to this function, which can lead to a buffer overflow and a system crash.
