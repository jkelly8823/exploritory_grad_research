VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks if the socket pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it, which is a good practice to prevent NULL pointer dereferences.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code looks secure, but it is recommended to add input validation and error handling for user input to prevent potential buffer overflows and other attacks.
