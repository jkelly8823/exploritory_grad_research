EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential memory leak vulnerability where the service_name is allocated on the heap and then freed if the LLCP_SAP_MAX is reached. However, the pointer to the service_name is not updated after freeing the memory, which could lead to use-after-free vulnerability. This could allow an
