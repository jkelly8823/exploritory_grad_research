VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-2150. The code checks if the device is enabled before writing to the PCI configuration registers, and only allows access to memory and IO resources if the device is enabled. This prevents unauthorized access to the PCI configuration registers.
