VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability related to speculative execution and indirect branch prediction. The use of __fpsimd_enabled_nvhe() and __sysreg_save_state_nvhe() functions may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information through side-channel analysis. To mitigate this, consider using hardware-based
