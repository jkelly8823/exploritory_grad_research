VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a call to the SMC instruction, which is known to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks due to speculative execution. The SMC instruction can potentially leak sensitive information to an attacker with local user access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a side-channel resistant instruction or implement mitigations to prevent information disclosure
