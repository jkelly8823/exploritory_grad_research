VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the value_offs variable. An attacker could potentially overwrite memory beyond the allocated size of the struct ext4_xattr_entry_t structure, leading to arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking on the value
