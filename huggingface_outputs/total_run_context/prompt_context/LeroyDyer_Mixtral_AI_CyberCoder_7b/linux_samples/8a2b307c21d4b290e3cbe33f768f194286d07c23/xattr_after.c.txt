VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the value_offs field. An attacker could potentially overwrite memory beyond the allocated size of the struct ext4_xattr_entry_t structure, leading to arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add bounds checking to
