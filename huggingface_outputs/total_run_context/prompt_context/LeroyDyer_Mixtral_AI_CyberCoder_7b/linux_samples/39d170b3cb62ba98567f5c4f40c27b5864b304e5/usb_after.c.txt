VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability on line 11 and 13. The variable urb_context is assigned a NULL value on line 11, and then dereferenced on line 13 without checking if it is not NULL. This could lead to a segmentation fault or memory corruption.
