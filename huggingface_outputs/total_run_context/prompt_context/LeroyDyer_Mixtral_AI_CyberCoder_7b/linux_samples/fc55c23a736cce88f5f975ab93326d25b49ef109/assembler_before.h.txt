VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a macro asm_trace_hardirqs_off which is defined in the if statement. The macro is used to disable interrupts, which can lead to a potential vulnerability. The macro may not properly handle exceptions and interrupts, allowing an attacker to manipulate the interrupts and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
