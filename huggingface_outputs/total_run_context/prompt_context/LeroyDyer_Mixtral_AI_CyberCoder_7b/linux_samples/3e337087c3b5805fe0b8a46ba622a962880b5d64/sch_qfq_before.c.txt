VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow on the variable 'new_agg' because the size of the allocated memory is not checked before being assigned to it. The function 'kzalloc' does not guarantee that the allocated memory is large enough to hold the structure. The variable 'new_agg' is not checked for NULL before being assigned to.
