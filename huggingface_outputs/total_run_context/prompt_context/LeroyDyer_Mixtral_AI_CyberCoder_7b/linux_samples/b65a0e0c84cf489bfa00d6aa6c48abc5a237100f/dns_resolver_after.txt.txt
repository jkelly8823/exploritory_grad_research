EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a function call to create a dns_resolver object and then attempts to read keys from userspace using keyctl_read() and keyctl print/pipe. This is a potential security vulnerability as it allows unauthorized access to sensitive information. The function call can be exploited to read keys from userspace, which can
