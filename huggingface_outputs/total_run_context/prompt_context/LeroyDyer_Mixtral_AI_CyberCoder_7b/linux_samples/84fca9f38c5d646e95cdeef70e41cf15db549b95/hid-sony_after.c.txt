EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential heap memory corruption vulnerability due to the use of kzalloc() which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and out-of-bounds write. The use of kzalloc() without checking its return value can result in a heap-based out-of-bounds write, which can be exploited by a crafted
