EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a memory allocation error, where the allocation of memory is not checked for NULL pointer. This can lead to heap memory corruption, denial of service, and out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a null check before allocating memory and add error handling to prevent memory allocation failure.
