VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code contains multiple array index errors in the initialization of the hid_input and hid_report_list variables, which can lead to heap memory corruption, NULL pointer dereference, and out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities. The use of list_entry() and list_empty() functions without bounds checking can result in buffer overflows and memory corruption
