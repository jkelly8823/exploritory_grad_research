VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The memory copying operations are done using the correct size of the data from the input buffers. The memory allocation is done using the correct size of the input buffers. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities
