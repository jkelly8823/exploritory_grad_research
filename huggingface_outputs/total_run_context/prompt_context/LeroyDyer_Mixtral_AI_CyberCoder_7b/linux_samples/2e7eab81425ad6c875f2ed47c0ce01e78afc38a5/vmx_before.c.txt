VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's KVM, where the indirect branch prediction barrier is not implemented, allowing for speculative execution attacks on L1 due to the assumption that L1 does not require retpolines or IBPB after running L2. This can lead to Spectre v2 attacks on
