VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the ext4_remove_space() function, where a use-after-free vulnerability can occur due to the lack of proper memory management. The code does not properly free the memory allocated for the block_group variable, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
