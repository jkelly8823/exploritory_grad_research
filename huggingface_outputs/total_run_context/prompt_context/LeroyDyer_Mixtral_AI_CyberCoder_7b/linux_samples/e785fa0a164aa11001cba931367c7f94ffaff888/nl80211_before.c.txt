VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the length of the attributes NL80211_REPLAY_CTR and NL80211_KEK, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add input validation to ensure that the attributes are present and of the correct length before access
