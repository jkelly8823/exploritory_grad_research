EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a memory initialization with all bits set to 0xff, which is a common technique used to mask the MAC address. However, this can be exploited by attackers to reveal the original MAC address by manipulating the bits in the packets sent to the device. The recommended fix is to use a random mask instead of all
