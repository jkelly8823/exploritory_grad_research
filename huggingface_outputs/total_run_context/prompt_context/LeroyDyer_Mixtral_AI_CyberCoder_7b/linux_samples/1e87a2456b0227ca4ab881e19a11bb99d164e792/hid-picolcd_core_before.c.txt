VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array index. The code snippet increments the pointer by 10 and then decrements the index by 10, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the index
