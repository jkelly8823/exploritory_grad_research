VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the subtraction operation on cnt without checking the bounds. An attacker can craft a malicious input to overwrite the stack and potentially execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safe buffer size and check the input length before performing the subtr
