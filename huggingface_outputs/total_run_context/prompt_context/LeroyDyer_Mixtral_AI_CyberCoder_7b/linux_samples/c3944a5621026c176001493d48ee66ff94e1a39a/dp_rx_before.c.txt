VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential attack where an adversary can send fragmented frames to the device, which can allow them to decrypt specific fragments of the frame when the encryption key is renewed. This can lead to a potential security vulnerability. To mitigate this, the device should enforce encryption of all fragments under the same key.
