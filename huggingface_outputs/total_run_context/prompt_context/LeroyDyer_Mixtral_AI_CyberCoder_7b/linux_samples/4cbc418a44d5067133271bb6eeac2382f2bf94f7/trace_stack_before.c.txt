VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to local_irq_restore() which is a function that restores the interrupts to their previous state. This function is known to be vulnerable to a race condition where a process in the guest kernel can read memory from another process in the same guest. This vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions 4.1
