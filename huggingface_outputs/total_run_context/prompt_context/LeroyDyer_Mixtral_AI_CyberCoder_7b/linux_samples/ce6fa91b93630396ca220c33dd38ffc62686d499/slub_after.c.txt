VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel, where a race condition can occur due to the use of a naive detection of double free or corruption. The use of the BUG_ON macro to check for double free or corruption is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. To fix this issue, the code should implement more
