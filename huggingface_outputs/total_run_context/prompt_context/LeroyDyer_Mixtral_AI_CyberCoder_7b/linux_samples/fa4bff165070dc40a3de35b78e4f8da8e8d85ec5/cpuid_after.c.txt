EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a call to cpuid() function which is known to be vulnerable to MDS attacks. The CPUID instruction is used to retrieve information about the processor's capabilities, and the processor may leak information about the processor state through the side channel. The CPUID instruction is vulnerable to MDS attacks due to the processor's microarchitect
