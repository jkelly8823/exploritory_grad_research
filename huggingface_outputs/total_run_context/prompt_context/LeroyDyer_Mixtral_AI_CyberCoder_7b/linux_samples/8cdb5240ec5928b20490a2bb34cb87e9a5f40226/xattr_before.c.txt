VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write due to the lack of bounds checking on the total_size variable. An attacker could potentially write beyond the bounds of the stack frame, causing a buffer overflow and a system crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add bounds checking to ensure that total_size does
