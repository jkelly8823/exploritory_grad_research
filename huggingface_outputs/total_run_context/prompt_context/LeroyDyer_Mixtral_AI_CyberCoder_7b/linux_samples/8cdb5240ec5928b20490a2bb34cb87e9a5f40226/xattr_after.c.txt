VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The code does not check the length of the e_name_len and e_value_size, which could allow an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the stack, causing a stack overflow and a potential denial of service.
