VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a function definition for do_tkill, which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of initialization of a data structure. This can allow local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by exploiting the tkill or tgkill system call. To fix this, the data structure should be properly initialized before use.
