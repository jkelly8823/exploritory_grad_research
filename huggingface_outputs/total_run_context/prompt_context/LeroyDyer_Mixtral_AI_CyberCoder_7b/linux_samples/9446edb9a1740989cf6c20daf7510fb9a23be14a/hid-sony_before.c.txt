EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write, as it allocates memory on the heap without checking the return value of kzalloc(), which could lead to a memory exhaustion attack. The use of kzalloc() without checking its return value could allow an attacker to exhaust the heap memory, causing
