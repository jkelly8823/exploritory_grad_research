VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 11-13, 15-18
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer signedness error as it uses get_user() and __get_user() to read user space data into unsigned char variables. These functions can read signed integers into unsigned char variables, leading to potential integer overflows and buffer overflows. To
