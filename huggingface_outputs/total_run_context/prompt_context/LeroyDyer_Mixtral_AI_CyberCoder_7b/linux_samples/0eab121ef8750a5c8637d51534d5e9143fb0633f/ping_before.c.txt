VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks the length of the input string len, but it does not check the input buffer size. If len is greater than 0xFFFF, it will cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to a memory corruption and potentially execute arbitrary code. To fix this, the input buffer size should be checked before copying the data to the buffer.
