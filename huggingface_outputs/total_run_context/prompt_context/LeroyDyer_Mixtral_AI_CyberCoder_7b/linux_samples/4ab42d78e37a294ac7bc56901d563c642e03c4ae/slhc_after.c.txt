VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The code checks that the input values for rslots and tslots are within the valid range of 0 to 255, and allocates memory for the structs accordingly. There is no indication of a NULL pointer dereference or system crash.
