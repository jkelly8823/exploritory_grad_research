VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow and memory corruption due to the lack of input validation on the usage index and report index. The input is not checked for out-of-bounds values, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite memory and cause a denial of service or a NULL pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation
