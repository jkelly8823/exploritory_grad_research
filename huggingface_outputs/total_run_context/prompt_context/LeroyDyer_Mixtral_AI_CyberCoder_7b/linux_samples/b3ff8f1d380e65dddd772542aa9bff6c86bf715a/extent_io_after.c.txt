EXPLANATION: The code contains a use-after-free vulnerability, where the variable fs_info is not properly initialized and can lead to memory corruption. The use-after-free vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code. To fix this, initialize fs_info to NULL before use.
