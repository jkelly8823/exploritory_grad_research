VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a mutex_unlock() call without a corresponding mutex_lock() call, which is a potential vulnerability. This can lead to a race condition where the mutex is not properly synchronized, allowing a local attacker to exhaust system resources by acquiring the mutex and preventing other processes from accessing it.
