VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code checks the magic number and the block size of the buffer, but it does not check the integrity of the data in the buffer. An attacker can potentially manipulate the data in the buffer to cause a use-after-free vulnerability by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
