VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's l2cap_parse_conf_req function, where the remote_id, remote_stype, and remote_msdu are assigned directly from the received data without proper input validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to leak kernel pointers
