VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 118-121
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the dvb_frontend_get_event function, where the wait_event_interruptible function is called with the condition dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). This function may cause the process to sleep and block the execution of the program.
