EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a file inclusion vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of user input. The use of regular expressions to construct file paths can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The use of File.expand_path() function can be exploited to access files outside of the intended directory.
