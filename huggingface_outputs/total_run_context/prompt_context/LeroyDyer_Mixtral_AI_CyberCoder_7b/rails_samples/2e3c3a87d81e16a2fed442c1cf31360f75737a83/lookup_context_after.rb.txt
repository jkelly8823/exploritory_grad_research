EXPLANATION: The code uses a set to filter out invalid MIME types, but it does not check if the set is empty before attempting to create a new instance of the cache. If an invalid MIME type is provided, it will attempt to create a new instance of the cache, which can lead to memory consumption and a denial of service.
