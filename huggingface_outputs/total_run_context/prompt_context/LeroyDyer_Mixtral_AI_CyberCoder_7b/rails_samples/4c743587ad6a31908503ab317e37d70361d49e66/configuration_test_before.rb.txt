VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a test case that sets the secret_key_base to nil and disables the session store, which can lead to a potential security vulnerability. The secret_key_base is used to verify the authenticity of the request. Setting it to nil can allow an attacker to bypass the verification process and potentially execute arbitrary
