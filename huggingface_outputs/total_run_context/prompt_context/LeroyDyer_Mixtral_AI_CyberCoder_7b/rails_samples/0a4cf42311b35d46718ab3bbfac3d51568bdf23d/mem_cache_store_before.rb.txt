EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a deserialization vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a serialized object as the value of a cache entry. The deserialization occurs in the read_entry and write_entry methods. The deserialization is performed using the Marshal.load method, which can execute arbitrary
