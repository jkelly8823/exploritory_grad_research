EXPLANATION: The code snippet demonstrates a deserialization vulnerability where the marshal.dump() function is used to store an array of integers in the cache, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The use of Marshal.dump() is a security risk as it can deserialize untrusted data from
