EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in the write_entry method, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a serialized object as the value of the entry. The deserialization occurs when the options[:raw] is set to true and the local_cache is enabled. The deserial
