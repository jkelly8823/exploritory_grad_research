EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a bypass attack where an attacker can modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters to execute arbitrary HTML files inline. This can be exploited by crafting a specially crafted file and using a signed URL to access private files. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.2.
