EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to open redirect vulnerability as it does not properly sanitize the input and allows for a leading dot in the host header. This can be exploited by an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website. To fix this, sanitize the input and validate the host header to only allow specific domains.
