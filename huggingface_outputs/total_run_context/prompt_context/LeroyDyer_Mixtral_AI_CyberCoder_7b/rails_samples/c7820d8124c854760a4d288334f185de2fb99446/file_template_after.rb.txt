EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a file reading function that does not include any input validation or sanitization, which could allow an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the system. It is recommended to use a safer method such as File.open with a whitelist of allowed file extensions and paths to prevent unintended file access.
