VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the WHERE clause in the SQL query. The use of the sanitize_limit method does not ensure that the limit parameter is an integer value, allowing for non-numeric arguments to be passed in the WHERE clause, which can be exploited by attackers
