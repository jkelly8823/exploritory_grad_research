VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code uses the Digest::SHA256.hexdigest method to compare the credentials, which is not a constant-time algorithm and can be exploited by attackers to measure the time difference between the two hashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a constant-time algorithm such as bcrypt to compare credentials instead.
