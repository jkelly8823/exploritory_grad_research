EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155, as it uses a JSON payload that contains a nil value which can bypass the intended database query restrictions and trigger missing WHERE clauses. To fix this, sanitize the input before parsing it to prevent malicious payloads from being executed.
