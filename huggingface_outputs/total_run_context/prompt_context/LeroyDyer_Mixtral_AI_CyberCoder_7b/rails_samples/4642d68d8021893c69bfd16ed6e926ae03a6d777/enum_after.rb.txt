EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a method named extended that sets the instance_writer to false for class_attribute and defined_enums to an empty hash. This allows for the bypassing of intended validation steps, which can be exploited by remote attackers. To fix this, the instance_writer should be set to true and defined_enums should be
