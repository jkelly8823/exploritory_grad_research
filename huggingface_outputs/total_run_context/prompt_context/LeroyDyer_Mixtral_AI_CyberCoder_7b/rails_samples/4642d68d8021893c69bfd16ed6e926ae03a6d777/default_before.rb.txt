EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the use of instance-level writers for class accessors, which can allow remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. This is a known vulnerability in Ruby on Rails. To mitigate this, it is recommended to use class-level accessors instead of instance-level accessors.
