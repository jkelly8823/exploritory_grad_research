VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential code injection vulnerability in the Active Storage configuration. The use of assert_equal and assert_includes methods can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing malicious input. The use of these methods should be avoided in favor of safer alternatives such as assert_equal_to or assert_match.
