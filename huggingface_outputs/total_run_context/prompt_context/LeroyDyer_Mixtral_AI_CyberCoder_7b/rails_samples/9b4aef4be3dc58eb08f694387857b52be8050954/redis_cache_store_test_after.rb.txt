VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a deserialization attack due to the use of the sleep method, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The use of sleep 3 is a red flag as it allows for the execution of arbitrary code. The recommended fix is to use a whitelist of allowed keys and sanitize user input.
