VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input validation and sanitization. The use of `params[:ids]` instead of `params[:ids].to_i` can allow an attacker to pass malicious input to the `find_by_ids` method, which can lead to unintended behavior.
