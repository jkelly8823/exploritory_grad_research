VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the request is cross-domain and sets the content type to multipart/form-data if it is a string. However, it does not check for CSRF tokens. This could allow an attacker to send CSRF tokens to wrong domains, which is a known vulnerability.
