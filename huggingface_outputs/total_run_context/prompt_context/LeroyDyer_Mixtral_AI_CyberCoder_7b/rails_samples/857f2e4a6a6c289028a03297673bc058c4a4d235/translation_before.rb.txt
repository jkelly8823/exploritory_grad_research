VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the use of the translate and localize methods, which are known to be vulnerable to XSS attacks if the key contains untrusted user input. The fix is to use the safe_key method instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the safe_key method instead of translate and localize to prevent XSS attacks.
