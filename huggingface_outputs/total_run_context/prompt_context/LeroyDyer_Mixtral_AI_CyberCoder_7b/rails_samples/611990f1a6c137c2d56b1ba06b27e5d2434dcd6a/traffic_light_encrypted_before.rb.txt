EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `encrypts` method to store the state of the `TrafficLight` object in the database, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the data in the database via SQL injection attacks. To mitigate this, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
