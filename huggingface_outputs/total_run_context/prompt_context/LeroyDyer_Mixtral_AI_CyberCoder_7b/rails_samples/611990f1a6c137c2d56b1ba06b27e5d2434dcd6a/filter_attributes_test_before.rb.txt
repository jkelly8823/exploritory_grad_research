EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a possible RCE vulnerability due to the use of YAML serialization of attributes in ActiveRecord. The use of YAML serialization can allow an attacker to manipulate data in the database, potentially leading to RCE. To mitigate this, it is recommended to use JSON or other safer serialization formats instead.
