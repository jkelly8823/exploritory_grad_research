VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code imports the JDOM and REXML libraries, which are known to be vulnerable to a stack overflow attack. The use of these libraries should be avoided in favor of safer alternatives.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer XML parsing library such as Nokogiri or TinyXML instead of JDOM or REXML
