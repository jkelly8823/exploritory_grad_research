VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code sets the default value of MEM_SIZE and JTAG_OFFSET to hardcoded values, which can be easily reverse engineered to reveal the memory size and JTAG offset. This can be exploited by attackers to determine the memory size and JTAG offset, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the device.
