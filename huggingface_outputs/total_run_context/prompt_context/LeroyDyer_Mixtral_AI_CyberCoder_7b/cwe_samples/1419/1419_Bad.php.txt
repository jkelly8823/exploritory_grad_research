EXPLANATION: The code does not check the return value of the login_user() function, which could lead to the program continuing execution even if the login fails. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and access the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Check the return value of the login_user() function and take appropriate action based on the result.
