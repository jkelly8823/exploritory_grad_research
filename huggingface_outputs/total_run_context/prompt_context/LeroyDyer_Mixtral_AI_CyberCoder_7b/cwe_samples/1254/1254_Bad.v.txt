VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to timing attacks because it performs comparison operations sequentially, which can be exploited by an attacker to intercept the process. The attacker can observe the time it takes for each comparison to be made and determine the correct password. To mitigate this, the comparison should be performed in a single operation.
