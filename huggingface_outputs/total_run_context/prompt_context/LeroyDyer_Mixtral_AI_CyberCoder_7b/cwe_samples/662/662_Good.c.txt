EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a mutex lock and unlock operation without checking the return value of pthread_mutex_lock(), which can lead to a race condition where multiple threads can access the shared resource simultaneously, causing data corruption or unpredictable behavior. Use a conditional statement to check the return value and handle errors appropriately.
