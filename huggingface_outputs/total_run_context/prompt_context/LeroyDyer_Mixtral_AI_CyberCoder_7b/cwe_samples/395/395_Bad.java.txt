EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a try-catch block that catches NullPointerException instead of using a null check before calling the method. This is a poor practice as it allows the program to continue execution even if the method call fails. Instead, the method call should be checked for null before invoking it to prevent the NullPointerException from occurring.
