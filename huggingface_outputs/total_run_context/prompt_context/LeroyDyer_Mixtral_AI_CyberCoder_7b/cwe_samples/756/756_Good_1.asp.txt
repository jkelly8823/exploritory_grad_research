EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows that the customErrors mode is set to "On" which means that error pages are displayed to the user when an error occurs. This can expose sensitive information to the user, such as stack traces and error messages. It is recommended to set customErrors to "Off" and handle errors in a more controlled manner.
