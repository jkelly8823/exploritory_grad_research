VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The catch block is empty, which means that any exception thrown by the try block will not be handled. This is a security vulnerability as it can lead to unintended behavior. The exception should be handled properly or the try block should be removed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The catch block should contain a proper exception handling mechanism
