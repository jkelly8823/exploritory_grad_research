VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it allocates memory based on the value of a - b, which is not checked for bounds. The size of the buffer is not limited, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite memory beyond the buffer's bounds. To fix this, the size of the buffer should be limited to a known
