VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows, as the size variable is not checked for validity before being used in the malloc() function call. This can lead to memory allocation of an arbitrary amount of memory, which can be exploited by an attacker to exhaust system resources or cause memory corruption. To fix this, the size variable should
