VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory based on an untrusted input value, which can lead to memory exhaustion attacks. The input value is not validated, and the size of the array is not limited. To mitigate this, input validation and bounds checking should be performed before allocating memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use input validation and bounds checking
