EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as it does not sanitize the input before using it in the SQL query. The input is directly inserted into the query without any form of input validation or sanitization. The input is not escaped or sanitized before being used in the query, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.
