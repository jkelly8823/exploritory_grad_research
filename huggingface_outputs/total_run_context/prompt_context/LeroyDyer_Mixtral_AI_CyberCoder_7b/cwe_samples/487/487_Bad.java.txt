EXPLANATION: The use of final keyword on the class and method declaration indicates that the class and method cannot be extended or overridden. This can make the code less flexible and harder to maintain. It is not a good practice to hide the implementation details of the class and method. It is better to make them public to allow for future modifications and improvements.
