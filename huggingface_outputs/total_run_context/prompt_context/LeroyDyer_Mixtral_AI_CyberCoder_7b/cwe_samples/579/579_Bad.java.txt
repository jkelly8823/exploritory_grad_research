VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample shows a potential vulnerability where a non-serializable object is stored in an HttpSession attribute. This can lead to reliability issues as the object may not be properly serialized during serialization, leading to unpredictable behavior when the session is restored. To fix this, the object should be serialized before being stored in the session.
