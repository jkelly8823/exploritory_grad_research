VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 6-8, 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the wrong operator in the push and pop functions. The use of the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (==) can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. The correct operator should be == for comparison.
