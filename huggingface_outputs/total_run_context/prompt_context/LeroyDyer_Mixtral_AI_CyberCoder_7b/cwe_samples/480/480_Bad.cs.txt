EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a logical error where the equality operator is used instead of the assignment operator. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The correct code should use == or != instead of =.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the = operator with == or != operator in the if statement to fix the issue.
