EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a logical error where the if statement is not properly structured. The correct syntax should be if (value == 100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);} else {printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);} to ensure that the condition is evaluated before the statement.
