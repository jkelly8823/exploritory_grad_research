VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a type-casting error, where the pointer p is casted to a char pointer, which is not allowed. The correct way to access the second character of the string would be using the [] operator. The correct code should be: char second_char = *(p + 1);
