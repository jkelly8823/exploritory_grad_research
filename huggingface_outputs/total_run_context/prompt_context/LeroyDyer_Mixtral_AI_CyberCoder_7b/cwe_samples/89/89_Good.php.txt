VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as it directly concatenates user input into the SQL query without any sanitization or prepared statement usage. The input is not properly sanitized and escaped, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
