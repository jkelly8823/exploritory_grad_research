VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as it concatenates user input directly into the SQL query without any sanitization. The input is not escaped, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the query string
