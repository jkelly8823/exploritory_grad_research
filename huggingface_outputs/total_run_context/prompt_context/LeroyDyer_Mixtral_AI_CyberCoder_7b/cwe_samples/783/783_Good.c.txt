EXPLANATION:
The expression in the if statement is incorrect because the == operator has higher precedence than the logical NOT operator. The correct way to write this would be:
if ((!isUser = AuthenticateUser(username, password)) { ... 
This is because the NOT operator should be applied before the == operator to ensure the correct logic is used.
