VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm which is considered insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. It is recommended to use a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or scrypt.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or scrypt to hash the passwords.
