EXPLANATION:
The code uses a union to store a string and an integer, but the conversion from string to integer is not done correctly. The cast from a pointer to an integer is undefined behavior. The correct way to convert a string to an integer is to use strtol or similar functions. The code should use a string comparison instead of a cast.
