VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to spoofing attacks as it does not properly validate the authenticity of the client IP address and the secret key. The server trusts the client IP address and the secret key without proper verification, allowing an attacker to potentially impersonate a trusted client and send malicious data. To fix this, the server should implement proper authentication mechanisms
