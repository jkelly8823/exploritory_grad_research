VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the source IP address is null or equals to an approved IP address, which is a weak authentication scheme. The attacker can easily spoof the source IP address to bypass the authentication check.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a more robust authentication mechanism such as using a secure authentication protocol like OAuth or JWT tokens.
