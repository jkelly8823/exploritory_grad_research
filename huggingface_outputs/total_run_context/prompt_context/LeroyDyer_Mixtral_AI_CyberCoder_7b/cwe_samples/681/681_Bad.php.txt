EXPLANATION:
The conversion from float to integer can lead to loss of precision and truncation of the decimal part of the float value. This can result in unexpected behavior if the resulting integer value is used in a context where the original float value is required. To avoid this, use a proper conversion method such as rounding or checking the range of the integer value before using it
