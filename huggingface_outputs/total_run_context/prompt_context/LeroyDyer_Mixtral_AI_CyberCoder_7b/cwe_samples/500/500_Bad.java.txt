VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a public static field that is not marked as final, which means that it can be modified by any class in the application. This can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption. To fix this, the field should be declared as final.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Declare the field as final to prevent unintended modification.
