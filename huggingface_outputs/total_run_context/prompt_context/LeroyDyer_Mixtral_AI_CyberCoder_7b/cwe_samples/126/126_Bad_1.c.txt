VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 6
EXPLANATION:
The strncpy function is used to copy a string into a buffer, but the size of the buffer is not checked against the length of the source string. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the source string is longer than the buffer size. The use of the size parameter is incorrect, as it should be the size of the destination buffer.
