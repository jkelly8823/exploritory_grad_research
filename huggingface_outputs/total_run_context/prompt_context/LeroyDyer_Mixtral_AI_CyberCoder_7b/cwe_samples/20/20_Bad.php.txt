EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack as it does not sanitize user input before outputting it in an HTML context. The user input is directly inserted into an HTML context without any sanitization or encoding. To fix this, use prepared statements or input validation and sanitization.
