VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code checks the length of the passwords and compares each character in the passwords. This is a covert timing channel vulnerability as the execution time of the code depends on the input. An attacker can observe the execution time to infer the correct password.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a hash function to compare passwords instead of a comparison
