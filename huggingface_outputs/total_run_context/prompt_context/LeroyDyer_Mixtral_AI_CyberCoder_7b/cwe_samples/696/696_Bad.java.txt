EXPLANATION: The code checks if the input path starts with "/safe_dir/" and then attempts to create a File object from the path. This is a potential security issue as it does not check if the path is a valid directory before attempting to create a File object from it. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to access unintended directories.
