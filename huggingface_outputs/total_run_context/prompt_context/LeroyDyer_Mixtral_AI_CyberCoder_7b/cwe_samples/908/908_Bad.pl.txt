VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the $state variable is defined before extracting the user ID from it. If $state is not defined, the script will fail on the second line. This is a potential vulnerability as it can lead to undefined variable errors and unexpected behavior. It is recommended to check if $state is set before attempting to use it.
