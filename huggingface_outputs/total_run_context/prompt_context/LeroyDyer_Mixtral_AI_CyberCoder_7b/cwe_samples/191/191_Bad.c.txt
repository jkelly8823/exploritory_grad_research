VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result. This is an example of integer overflows. The correct way to handle this is to use a larger data type or check the result for overflow before performing the subtraction.
