VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows, as the result of the subtraction of a from b is not checked against the minimum allowable integer value. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The result of the subtraction is not checked against the size of the buffer, which can result in a buffer overflow. The correct way to
