VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-178 (CWE-178) because it uses the replaceAll() method without a regular expression, which does not properly handle case sensitivity. This can lead to inconsistent results when dealing with input containing uppercase characters. To fix this, the regular expression should be used with flags to handle case sensitivity.
