VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses a pointer arithmetic operation on a char variable without bounds checking. The pointer arithmetic operation can lead to memory corruption and buffer overflow. The correct way to allocate memory for the variables a and b would be to use dynamic memory allocation using malloc or an array.
