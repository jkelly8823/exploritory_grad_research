EXPLANATION: The use of gets() is a dangerous function as it does not perform a null termination on the input, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use fgets() instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use fgets() instead of gets() to limit the number of characters read from the input stream.
