VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code uses a constant IV for encryption, which is not recommended as it can be easily predicted by an attacker. The IV should be random and unique for each encryption. The use of a constant IV makes the encryption vulnerable to attacks such as CBC attacks. To fix this, the IV should be generated randomly for each encryption operation.
