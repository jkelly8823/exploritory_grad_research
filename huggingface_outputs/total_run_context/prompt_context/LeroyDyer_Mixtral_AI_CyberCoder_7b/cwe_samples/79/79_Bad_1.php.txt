VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3,4,5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as it does not properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query. The use of sprintf() function is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection. Use prepared statements instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
