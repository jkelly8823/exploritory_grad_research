VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The session-timeout attribute is set to 1, which means that the session will never expire. This is a security risk as it allows an attacker to reuse old session credentials and potentially hijack a user's session. The recommended value should be a reasonable time interval, such as 30 minutes.
