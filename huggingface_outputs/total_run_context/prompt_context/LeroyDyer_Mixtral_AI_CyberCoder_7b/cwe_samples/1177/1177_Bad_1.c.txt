VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The use of strcpy() is a security risk as it does not perform bounds checking and is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. It is recommended to use strncpy() or strncpy() instead.

Use strncpy() or strncat() instead of strcpy() to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
