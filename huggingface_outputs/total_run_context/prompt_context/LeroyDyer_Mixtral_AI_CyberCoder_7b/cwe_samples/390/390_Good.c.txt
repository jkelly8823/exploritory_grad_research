VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value of malloc() and assumes that it always succeeds. This is a potential vulnerability as it does not handle the case where malloc() fails to allocate memory resources. The program should check the return value of malloc() and take appropriate action if it returns NULL.
