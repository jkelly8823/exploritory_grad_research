VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
EXPLANATION: The code does not include a null terminator after reading the string from the file path, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The use of MAXPATH as a constant value is also a potential issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a null terminator after reading the string and ensure that the buffer is large enough to store the maximum path length
