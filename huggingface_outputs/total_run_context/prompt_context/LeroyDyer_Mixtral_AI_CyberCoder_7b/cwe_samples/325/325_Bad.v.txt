VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 511
EXPLANATION:
The code does not include a secure random number generator for the key, which is a required step in the HMAC algorithm. This can lead to predictable keys and weaker encryption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure random number generator to generate keys for the HMAC algorithm.
