EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using malloc() and then checks if an error occurred. If an error occurred, it frees the memory using free(). However, if an error did not occur, it does not free the memory. This is a memory leak. The correct approach would be to free the memory regardless of whether an error occurred or not.
