VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as the input value of untrustedListSize is not validated before being used as an array index. The programmer assumes that the input is valid without checking its bounds. The programmer should validate the input to ensure that it is within the valid range of the array index.
