EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it does not validate the index before using it to access the array. The index value is not checked to ensure it is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to accessing memory outside the array, which can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability. To fix this, the code should check that the
