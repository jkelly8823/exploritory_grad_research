VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code uses an untrusted input (index) to access an array element, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The index is not validated before use, allowing an attacker to potentially access memory outside the bounds of the array. To fix this, the index should be validated to ensure it is within the valid range of the array.
