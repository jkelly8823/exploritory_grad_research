VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13, 15-17
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because the index value is not validated before being used as an array index. The index value is obtained from user input without any checks to ensure it is within the bounds of the array. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input is not properly sanit
