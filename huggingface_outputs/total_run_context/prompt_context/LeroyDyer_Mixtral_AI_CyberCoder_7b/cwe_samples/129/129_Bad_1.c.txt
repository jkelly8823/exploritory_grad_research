VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses untrusted input without validating the index before accessing the array. The input is not validated before being used as an array index, which can lead to out-of-bounds access and memory corruption. To fix this, the input should be validated before being used as an array index
