VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it uses an untrusted input (index) to access an array without validating it. The index value is not checked to ensure it is within the bounds of the array. The programmer should validate the index before using it to access the array to prevent accessing invalid array indices.
