EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential cache side channel vulnerability where the processor event allows transient operations to access architecturally restricted data in a shared microarchitectural structure, potentially exposing data over a covert channel. The processor event is the LDR instruction, which can allow data to be accessed from another address space. To mitigate this vulnerability
