VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the hostname ends with "trustme.com" to determine if the host is trusted, which is a weak access control mechanism. An attacker could potentially manipulate the IP address to bypass this check.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a whitelist of trusted domains instead of a single string check.
