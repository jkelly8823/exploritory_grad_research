EXPLANATION: The session-properties element has a property named idLengthBytes with a value of 8, which is too small to provide sufficient entropy for a secure session ID. This can make the session IDs predictable and susceptible to brute force attacks. It is recommended to use a larger value to increase the security of the session IDs.
