EXPLANATION: The code checks if the user is authorized to view the file after attempting to read the file, which is a backwards approach. The correct order should be to check if the user is authorized before attempting to read the file. This is a race condition vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Check user authorization before attempting to read the file.
