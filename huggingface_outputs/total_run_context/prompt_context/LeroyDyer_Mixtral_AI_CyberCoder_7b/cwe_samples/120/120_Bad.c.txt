VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the input from the user is directly copied to the last_name array without checking the length of the input string. This can lead to overwriting memory beyond the bounds of the array, causing a buffer overflow. To fix this, the input should be checked against the size of the array before copying it.
