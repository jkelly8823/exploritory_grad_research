EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the function copies the input string to the buffer without checking the size of the input string. The input string length is not checked against the size of the buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow. To fix this, the input string length should be checked and the copy operation should be limited to the size of the
