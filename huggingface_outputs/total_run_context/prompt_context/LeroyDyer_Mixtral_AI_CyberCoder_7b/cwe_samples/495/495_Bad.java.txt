VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The method getColors() returns a reference to the private data structure colors, which is a security vulnerability as it allows the caller to modify the data structure directly. The recommended fix is to return a copy of the data structure instead of the reference.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the method should return a copy of the colors array
