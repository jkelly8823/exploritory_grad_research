EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as it directly concatenates user input into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. The input is not escaped, which can lead to malicious users to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
