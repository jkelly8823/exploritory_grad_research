EXPLANATION: The code dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL. This is a Null pointer dereference vulnerability. The code assumes that the response pointer is not nil, but it can be nil. This can lead to undefined behavior and crashes. To fix this, the code should check if response is not nil before dereferencing it.
