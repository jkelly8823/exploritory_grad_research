EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to memory leak as it calls free() on a pointer that was not previously allocated using malloc() or calloc(). This can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption. Always allocate memory before freeing it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use malloc() or calloc() to allocate memory and free() to deallocate
