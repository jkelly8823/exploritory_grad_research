VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it calls free() on a pointer to a heap allocated memory without checking if the pointer is NULL. This can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior. The correct way to handle this would be to check if the pointer is not NULL before calling free().
