VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-471 (CWE-471) as the array is mutable and can be modified by an attacker. The recommended fix is to use immutable data structures or use a constant variable instead of an array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use an immutable data structure or constant variable instead
