VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-393 because the catch block does not return an error code or status code to indicate that an exception was thrown. Instead, it sends a 404 Not Found response, which is not an accurate representation of the actual error. This can lead to misinterpretation of the error by the client.
