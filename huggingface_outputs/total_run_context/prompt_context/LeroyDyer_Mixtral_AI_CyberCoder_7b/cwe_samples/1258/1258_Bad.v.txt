VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13, 16-21
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the AES encryption algorithm where the key values are not cleared from the registers when the debug mode is entered. This could lead to information leakage and potential key recovery by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability
