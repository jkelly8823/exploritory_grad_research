VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5, 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows as the value of numHeaders is not checked before being used to allocate memory for the array of PacketHeader structs. This could lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior. The correct approach would be to use a safe integer type or check the value before allocating memory.
