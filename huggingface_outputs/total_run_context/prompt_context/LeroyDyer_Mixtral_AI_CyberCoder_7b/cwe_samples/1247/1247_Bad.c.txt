VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a conditional statement that checks if the signature matches a certain value. If the signature does not match, the firmware is not loaded. This is a potential vulnerability as it does not contain any error handling or input validation, which could allow an attacker to potentially inject malicious code or manipulate the firmware loading process.
