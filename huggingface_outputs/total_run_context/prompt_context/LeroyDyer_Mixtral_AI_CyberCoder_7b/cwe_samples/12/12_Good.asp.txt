EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows that the customErrors mode is set to "RemoteOnly", which allows custom error pages to be displayed only when an error occurs remotely. This setting can be exploited by attackers to obtain information about the application's internal structure and error messages. It is recommended to set customErrors mode to "Off" to prevent information leakage.
