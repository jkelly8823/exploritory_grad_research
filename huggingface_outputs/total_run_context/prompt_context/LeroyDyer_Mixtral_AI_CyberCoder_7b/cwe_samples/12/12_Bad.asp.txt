VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows that custom error pages are disabled, which means that the application will display the default error pages when an error occurs. This can expose sensitive information to attackers, such as stack traces and error messages, which can be used to infer the structure of the application and identify vulnerabilities. Enabling custom error pages is recommended to prevent this information leakage
