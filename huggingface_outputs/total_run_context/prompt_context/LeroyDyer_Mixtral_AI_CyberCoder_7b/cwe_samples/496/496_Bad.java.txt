EXPLANATION:
Assigning public data to a private array is equivalent to giving public access to the array. This can lead to unintended data exposure and unauthorized access to the array. To fix this, use a private setter method instead of a public field.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line to:
private String[] userRoles;
