VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
EXPLANATION: The use of srand(time()) and rand() is not recommended for generating random numbers in a security context as they are not cryptographically secure. Instead, use cryptographically secure random number generators such as RNGCryptGenRandom() or CryptGenRandom() to ensure randomness and unpredictability.
