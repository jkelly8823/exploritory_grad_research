VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code uses SHA-1 which is considered insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. It is recommended to use a cryptographic hash function with a stronger security guarantee, such as SHA-256 or bcrypt. Additionally, the code does not include a salt, which is a random value added to the password before hashing, making it
