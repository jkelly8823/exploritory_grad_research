VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm which is considered insecure due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. It is recommended to use a cryptographic hash function with a salt to prevent precomputed tables and rainbow tables from being used to reverse the hashed passwords. The salt should be unique for each user and stored with the hashed password
