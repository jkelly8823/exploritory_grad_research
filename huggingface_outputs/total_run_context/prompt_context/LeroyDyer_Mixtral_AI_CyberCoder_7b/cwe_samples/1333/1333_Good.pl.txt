VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the code has a high computational complexity due to the use of a positive lookahead assertion. The use of a positive lookahead assertion in the regular expression can result in exponential time complexity, which can lead to performance issues and resource consumption. It is recommended to use a more efficient regular expression or consider using a
