VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3,4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a predictable initialization vector (IV) for the CBC mode of encryption, which can be exploited by attackers to perform dictionary attacks. To mitigate this, the IV should be randomized and unique for each encryption operation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a random IV for each encryption operation to prevent dictionary attacks.
