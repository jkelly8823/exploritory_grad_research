EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a catch block that prints the exception stack trace to the console, which can reveal sensitive information about the system and the application. It is recommended to log exceptions without revealing any sensitive information. Instead, log the error message without the stack trace.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a logging framework to log exceptions without printing the stack trace
