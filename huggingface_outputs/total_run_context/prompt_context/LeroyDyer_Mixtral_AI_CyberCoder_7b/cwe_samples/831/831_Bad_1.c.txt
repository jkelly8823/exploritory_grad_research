VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13, 16-20
EXPLANATION:
The code registers the same handler function for both SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals, which is a violation of the principle of least privilege. A malicious actor could potentially abuse this to cause unintended behavior by sending a SIGHUP signal to the process, which would also terminate it.
