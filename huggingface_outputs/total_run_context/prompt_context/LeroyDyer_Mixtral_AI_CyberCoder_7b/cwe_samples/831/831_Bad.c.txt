VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a function handler that is used to handle two different signals, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege, as the function is granted permissions to handle multiple signals. It is recommended to define separate handlers for each signal to minimize the attack surface.
