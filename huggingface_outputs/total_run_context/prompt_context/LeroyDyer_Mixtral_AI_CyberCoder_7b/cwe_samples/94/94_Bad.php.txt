VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4, 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection as it uses user input without sanitization. The input is not validated and sanitized before being used in the fopen() and fwrite() functions. The input is directly passed to the functions without any form of input validation or sanitization. This can lead to code injection attacks
