EXPLANATION:
The variable test_string is not initialized before being used in the printf statement, which can lead to undefined behavior. The correct way to initialize the pointer is to use calloc or malloc to allocate memory for the string and set the value of test_string to the string literal. Alternatively, use a constant string instead of a pointer.
