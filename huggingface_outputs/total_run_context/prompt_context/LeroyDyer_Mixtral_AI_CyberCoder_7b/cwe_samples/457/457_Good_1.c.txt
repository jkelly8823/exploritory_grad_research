EXPLANATION:
The variable test_string is not initialized before being used in the printf statement, which can lead to undefined behavior. The correct way to handle this would be to initialize it to a null pointer or an empty string before the if statement.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Initialize test_string to a null pointer or an empty string before the if statement.
