EXPLANATION: The code does not check the return value of pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() functions, which may lead to undefined behavior if the mutex cannot be acquired or released. It is recommended to check the return value of these functions to ensure that the mutex is locked and unlocked correctly.
