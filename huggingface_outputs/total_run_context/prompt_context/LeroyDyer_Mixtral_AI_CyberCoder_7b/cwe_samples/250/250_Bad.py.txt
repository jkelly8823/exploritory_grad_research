VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-250 (Privilege Escalation) as it calls a function with higher privileges than necessary. The function createUserDir() calls raisePrivileges() which can lead to escalation of privileges. The function should be called with lower privileges to reduce the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
