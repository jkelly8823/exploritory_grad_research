EXPLANATION:
The SameSite attribute is not set in the cookieOptions object, which means the sessionId cookie can be sent with requests to any subdomain of example.com. This could lead to cross-site request forgery attacks. The recommended value for SameSite is 'strict' or 'lax' to restrict the cookie to the same origin as the request.
