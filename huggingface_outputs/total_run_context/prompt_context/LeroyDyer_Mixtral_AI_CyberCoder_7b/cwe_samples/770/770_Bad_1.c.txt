VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10, 13-15, 17-20
EXPLANATION: The code does not impose any restrictions on the size of the filename or the size of the buffer, which could lead to buffer overflows and file system traversal attacks. It is recommended to use a fixed size for the filename and buffer, and implement input validation to prevent such attacks
