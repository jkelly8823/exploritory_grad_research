EXPLANATION:
The code creates a socket and then forks a new process, but it does not synchronize access to the socket resource between the parent and child processes. This can lead to race conditions and potential data races. The child process may inherit an open socket file descriptor that was not closed by the parent process, leading to memory leaks and resource exhaustion.
