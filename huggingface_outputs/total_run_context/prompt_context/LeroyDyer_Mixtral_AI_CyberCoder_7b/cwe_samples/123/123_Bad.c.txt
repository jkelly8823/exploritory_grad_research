VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses malloc to allocate memory for buf1 and buf2, but does not check the size of the input before copying the string into the buffer. The input is copied into buf1 without checking its length, which can lead to buffer overflow. The input is then copied into buf2, which is allocated
