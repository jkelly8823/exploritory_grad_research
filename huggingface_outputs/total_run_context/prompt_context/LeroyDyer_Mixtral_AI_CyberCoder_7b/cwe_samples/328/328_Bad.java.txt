VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION: The code uses SHA-1 which is considered insecure due to its susceptibility to preimage and collision attacks. It is recommended to use a cryptographic hash function with a stronger security model such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a cryptographic hash function with a stronger security model such as SHA-2
