VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The if statement on line 10 is always false because the condition will never be true. The condition will always evaluate to false. The else statement on line 11 is not reachable. The correct way to fix this is to remove the if statement and the else statement. The else statement should be removed and the code should be indented
