VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a logical OR operation between two conditions, which can lead to a race condition vulnerability. The OR operator has a higher precedence than the AND operator, so the order of evaluation can be unpredictable. This can result in unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. To fix this, use parentheses to enforce the intended logic.
