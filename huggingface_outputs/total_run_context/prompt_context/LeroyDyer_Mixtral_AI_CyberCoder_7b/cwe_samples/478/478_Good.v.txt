EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a switch statement with multiple conditions, but it does not have a default case. A default case is necessary to handle unexpected input values. The default case should check for all other possible input values that are not explicitly handled by the other cases. This can lead to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
