VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 5-7
EXPLANATION: The code does not include any locking mechanism to protect the state of the long variable from concurrent access, which can lead to data races and unpredictable behavior. To fix this, synchronization should be used to ensure that only one thread can access the variable at a time.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a synchronized block
