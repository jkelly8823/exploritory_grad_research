EXPLANATION: The code does not acquire a lock before accessing the shared resource and does not release the lock after use, which can lead to unexpected behavior and race conditions. It is recommended to use a locking mechanism such as pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() to ensure proper synchronization and avoid data races.
