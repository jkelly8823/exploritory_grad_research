VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a single-factor authentication scheme, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks and dictionary attacks. It is recommended to use a dual-factor authentication scheme to increase security.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a dual-factor authentication scheme, such as using a combination of a password and a security token or biometric authentication.
