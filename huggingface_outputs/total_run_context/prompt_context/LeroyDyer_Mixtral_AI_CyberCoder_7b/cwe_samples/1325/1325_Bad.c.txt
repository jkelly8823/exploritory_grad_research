VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-10
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory on the stack for each object, but it does not limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all the objects. This can lead to a stack overflow if the number of objects is too large. The code should use a dynamic allocation method like malloc() or a pre-allocated buffer to prevent stack overflow.
