EXPLANATION:
The code uses a simple hash function (sha1) to store and compare passwords, which is not considered secure. It is recommended to use a cryptographic hash function such as bcrypt or scrypt. The use of plaintext passwords is also insecure. Use a salted password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or scrypt.
