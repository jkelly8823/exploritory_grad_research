EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow condition because the function call to strcpy() does not check the length of the input string, which can lead to overwriting the buffer and potentially corrupting the stack. To fix this, the code should use a safer alternative such as strncpy() or strncpy() to limit the number of
