VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the index is calculated before the strcpy function is called. The result of strstr() is subtracted from destBuf, which is the address of the first character of the destination buffer. This means that the index is calculated before the buffer's address is adjusted by the size of the buffer.
