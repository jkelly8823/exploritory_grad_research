VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for an array of 10 chars using calloc, but the pointer is not initialized before use. This can lead to undefined behavior. The pointer should be initialized to NULL or an appropriate value before use.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the pointer to NULL or a valid memory address before use.
