EXPLANATION:
The code registers a BroadcastReceiver with the intent filter "com.example.RemoveUser" which is not a standard Android intent action. This could allow an attacker to potentially intercept and manipulate the intent, leading to unintended behavior. Use a standard action or a custom action with a proper authority check.
