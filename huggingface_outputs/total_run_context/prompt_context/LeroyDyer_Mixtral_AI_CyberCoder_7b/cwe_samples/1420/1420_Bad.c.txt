VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can lead to a buffer overflow. The multiplication of an integer by a constant value (4096) can result in an integer overflow, causing the result to exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unintended behavior and memory corruption.
