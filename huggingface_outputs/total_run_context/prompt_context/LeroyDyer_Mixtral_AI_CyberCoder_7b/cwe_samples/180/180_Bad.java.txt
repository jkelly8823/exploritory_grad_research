VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the input path starts with "/safe_dir/" before canonicalizing it, which means that any input that does not start with "/safe_dir/" will be rejected. This can lead to a potential security vulnerability as it does not validate the input before canonicalization, allowing an attacker to potentially inject invalid characters into the input.
