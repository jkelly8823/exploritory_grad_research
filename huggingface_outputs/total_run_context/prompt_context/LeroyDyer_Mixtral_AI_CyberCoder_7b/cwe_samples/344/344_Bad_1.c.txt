EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a hardcoded pointer to a function address, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The function address should be a constant that is not hardcoded but rather a function pointer that is set at runtime.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a function pointer instead of a hardcoded address.
