VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to file inclusion vulnerability as it does not sanitize user input before using it in a file path, allowing users to potentially upload files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Sanitize user input and restrict file uploads to a specific directory. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent file inclusion attacks.
