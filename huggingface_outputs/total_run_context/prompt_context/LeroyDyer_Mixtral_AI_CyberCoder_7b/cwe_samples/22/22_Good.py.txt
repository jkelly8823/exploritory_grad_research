VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the user input without sanitization, which can lead to a directory traversal vulnerability. The input is directly used in the os.path.normpath() function without any sanitization. The input is not validated and can contain special characters that can lead to traversing outside the current directory.
