VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-10
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop due to the absence of an exit condition in the while loop. The loop will continue indefinitely until the connection is established or the maximum number of attempts is reached. This can lead to a denial of service attack or resource exhaustion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check for the connection status
