VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop due to the absence of an exit condition for the while loop. The if statement checks if rateSold is less than 1, but the else statement does not contain any exit condition. The else statement should contain a return statement to exit the loop when rateSold is less than 1.
