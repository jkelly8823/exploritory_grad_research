EXPLANATION:
The code uses the input() function to read user input without sanitizing the input, which can lead to code injection attacks. The input is not validated before being passed to the split() function, which can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. The input is then passed to the int() function without sanitization, which can lead to integer overflow
