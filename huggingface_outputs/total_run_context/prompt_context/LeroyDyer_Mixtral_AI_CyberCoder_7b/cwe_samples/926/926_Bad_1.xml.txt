VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION: The AndroidManifest.xml file contains a vulnerable line where the application exports a component (provider) without properly restricting which applications can access it. This can lead to unintended access to sensitive data or functionality. The component should be restricted to only the application's own package name.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the <exported-content> tag
