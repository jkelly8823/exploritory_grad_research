EXPLANATION: The code checks the referer field in the HTTP request against a hardcoded string, which is not a secure way to validate the origin of the request. The referer field can be easily modified by an attacker. Instead, use a whitelist of allowed referers or use a cryptographic hash to ensure the integrity of the request.
