VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code uses the current time as the seed for the random number generator, which is not sufficiently random and predictable. The seed should be based on a cryptographically secure random number generator.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as java.security.SecureRandom instead.
