EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a switch statement without a break statement after each case statement. This can cause the program to execute multiple statements when only one statement should be executed. The programmer intended to execute only one statement per case, but without break statements, the program will continue to the next case statement. This can lead to unintended behavior.
