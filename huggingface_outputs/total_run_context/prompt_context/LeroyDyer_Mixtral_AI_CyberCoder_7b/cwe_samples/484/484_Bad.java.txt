EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a switch statement without a break statement after each case statement. This can cause the program to execute multiple statements when only one should be executed. The programmer likely intended for only one statement to be executed per case, but without the break statement, the program will continue to execute statements until it reaches the next break or return statement.
