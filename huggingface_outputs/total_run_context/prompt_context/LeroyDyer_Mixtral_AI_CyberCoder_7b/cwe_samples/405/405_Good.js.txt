EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the code is not secure enough to prevent injection attacks. It only checks for whitespace characters and does not properly sanitize the input string. It is recommended to use a more secure regular expression to prevent injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a more secure regular expression to sanitize the input string before processing it
