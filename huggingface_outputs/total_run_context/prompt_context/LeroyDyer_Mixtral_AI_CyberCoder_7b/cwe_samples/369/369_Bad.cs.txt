VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code divides a value by zero, which can cause a runtime error and security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid dividing by zero, add a check to ensure that y is not zero before performing the division. For example, add a conditional statement to check if y is not zero before dividing.
