VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value of the getParameter() method, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the method call fails. It is recommended to add a check for null or empty string values.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a null check before comparing the string value to the constant. Use a null check or a try-catch
