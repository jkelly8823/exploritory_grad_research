VULNERABLE: YESVULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3EXPLANATION: The use of a constant seed value in the Random constructor is insecure as it can be easily predicted. The seed should be changed for each instance of the Random object to ensure randomness.RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a different seed value for each instance of the Random object to ensure randomness. For example, use the current time or a cryptographically secure random number
