VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the os.urandom() function to generate a seed for the random number generator, but it only generates 2 bytes of randomness. This is not sufficient to ensure the randomness of the seed. The recommended approach is to use a longer seed, such as os.urandom(16) or os.urandom(32
