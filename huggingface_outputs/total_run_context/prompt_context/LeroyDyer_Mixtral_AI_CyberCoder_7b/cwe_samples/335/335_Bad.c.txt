EXPLANATION:
The use of the srand() function without a seed value is a security risk as it uses the current time as the seed value, which is not secure. This can lead to predictable sequences of random numbers being generated. To fix this, use a random seed value instead.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a random seed value instead
