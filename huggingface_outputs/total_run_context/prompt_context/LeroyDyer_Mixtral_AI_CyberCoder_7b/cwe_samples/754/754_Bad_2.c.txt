EXPLANATION:
The code does not check if the user-supplied address is in the correct format before attempting to resolve it, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. It is recommended to validate the input before performing the gethostbyaddr() function call. The input should be checked to ensure it is in the correct format before attempting to resolve it.
