EXPLANATION:
The code does not check for the existence of the file before attempting to read from it, which could lead to a null pointer exception if the file does not exist. It is recommended to check if the file exists before attempting to read from it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check to ensure the file exists before attempting to read from it
