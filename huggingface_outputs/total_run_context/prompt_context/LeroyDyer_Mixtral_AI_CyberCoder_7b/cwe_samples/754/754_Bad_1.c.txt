VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2

The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the size of the buffer before copying the data into it. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the code should check the size of the buffer and allocate a buffer of appropriate size.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safe string
