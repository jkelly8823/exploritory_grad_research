VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can lead to buffer overflows. The multiplication of idx and array[idx] can result in an integer overflow, causing the value of v to be incorrect. This can lead to a security vulnerability where an attacker can potentially manipulate the data being forwarded through a covert channel. To
