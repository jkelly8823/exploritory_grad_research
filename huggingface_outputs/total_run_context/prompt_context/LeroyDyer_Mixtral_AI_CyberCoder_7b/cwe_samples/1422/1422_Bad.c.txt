VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack as it copies the value of an untrusted argument into a buffer without bounds checking. The untrusted_arg variable is not checked for validity before being copied into the array, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The correct way to fix this would be to check the size of
