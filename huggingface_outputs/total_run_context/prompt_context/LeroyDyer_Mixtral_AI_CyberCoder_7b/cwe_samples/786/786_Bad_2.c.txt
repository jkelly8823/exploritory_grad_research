VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses the result of strstr() to index into destBuf, which may be a null pointer if the search fails. This can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior. The correct way to use strstr() is to check its return value for a null pointer before indexing into destBuf.
