VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the index is not checked before accessing the array. The index is subtracted by 1 before accessing the array, which can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the array. The correct way to access the array would be to check the index against the size of the array before accessing it.
