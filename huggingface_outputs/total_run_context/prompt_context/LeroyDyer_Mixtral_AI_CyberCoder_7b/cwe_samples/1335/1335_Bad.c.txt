EXPLANATION:
The code shifts an unsigned integer by a negative amount, which is undefined behavior. The standard specifies that shifting an unsigned integer by a negative amount or an amount greater than the number of bits in the value is undefined behavior. The correct way to shift an unsigned integer is to use a positive amount less than or equal to the number of bits in the value.
