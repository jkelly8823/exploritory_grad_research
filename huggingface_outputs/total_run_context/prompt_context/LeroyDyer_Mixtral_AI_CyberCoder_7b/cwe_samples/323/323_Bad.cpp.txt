VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the same nonce for both the command and password, which is a security risk as the nonce should be unique for each request. The nonce should be generated randomly and used only once.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Generate a random nonce for each request and use different nonces for the command and password.
