VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The use of a public static final field to store a mutable object is not recommended as it can be changed by other classes in the same package or even from outside the package. It is better to use a constant instead.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a constant instead of a public static final field to store the USER_ROLES array.
