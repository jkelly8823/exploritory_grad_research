EXPLANATION: The return statement inside the finally block will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This can lead to security vulnerabilities as it can hide the fact that an exception was thrown and prevent proper error handling. The finally block should only contain cleanup code and not return statements. The correct way to handle exceptions is to use a try-catch block.
