EXPLANATION: The use of time() as a seed for srand() is not recommended as it is not truly random and can be predictable. Use a cryptographically secure random number generator instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as /dev/urandom or /dev/random to initialize srand() instead
