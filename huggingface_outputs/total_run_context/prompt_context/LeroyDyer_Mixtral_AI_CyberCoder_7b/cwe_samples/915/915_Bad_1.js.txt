EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-915 (CWE-915) because it does not properly control which attributes can be modified. The code sets the value of the "isAdmin" property on the "constructor.prototype" object, which is a prototype object, which can lead to unintended modification of the prototype object.
