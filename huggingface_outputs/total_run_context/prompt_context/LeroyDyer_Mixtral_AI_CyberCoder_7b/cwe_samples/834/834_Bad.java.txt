VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-10
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a potential vulnerability related to the CWE-834: Infinite Loop. The while loop condition is not sufficient to limit the number of iterations, which could lead to an infinite loop and consume excessive resources. The loop should be terminated when the inventoryCount becomes less than or equal to the minimumCount.
