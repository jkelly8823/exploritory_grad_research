VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-10
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a vulnerability related to the use of a real-time power consumption measurement to determine the value of the security token. This could potentially allow an attacker to determine the value of the security token by monitoring the power consumption of the device.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified
