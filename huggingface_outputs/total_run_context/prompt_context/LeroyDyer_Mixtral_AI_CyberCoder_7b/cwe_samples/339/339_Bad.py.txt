EXPLANATION: The code uses the os.urandom() function to generate a random seed, which is not cryptographically secure. The seed is only 2 bytes long, which is too short for a secure PRNG. The recommended solution is to use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as os.urandom(16) or os.urandom(
