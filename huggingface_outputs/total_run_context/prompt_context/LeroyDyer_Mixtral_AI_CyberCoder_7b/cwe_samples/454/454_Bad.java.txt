VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows and integer underflows as it uses Integer.getInteger() to parse a string input without bounds checking. This function can return a value outside the range of int, which can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. To fix this, use Integer.parseInt() instead, which throws exceptions for invalid inputs
