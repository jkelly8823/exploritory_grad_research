VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack as it does not properly control the allocation of resources, allowing an attacker to consume all available resources by repeatedly connecting to the server and accepting connections, leading to resource exhaustion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a limit on the number of connections accepted at a time to prevent resource exhaust
