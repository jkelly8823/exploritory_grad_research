EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer truncation errors. The value of intPrimitive is casted to a short variable, which can lead to data loss and unexpected behavior. To fix this, the intPrimitive should be casted to a long or unsigned long data type instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a long or unsigned long data type to store
