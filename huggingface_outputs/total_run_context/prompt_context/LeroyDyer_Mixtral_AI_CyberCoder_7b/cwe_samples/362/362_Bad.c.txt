EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a race condition vulnerability. The mutex lock and unlock operations are not atomic, allowing other threads to access the shared resource between the lock and unlock operations, which can lead to data corruption and unpredictable behavior. To fix this, use a mutex lock and unlock in a single operation, such as p
