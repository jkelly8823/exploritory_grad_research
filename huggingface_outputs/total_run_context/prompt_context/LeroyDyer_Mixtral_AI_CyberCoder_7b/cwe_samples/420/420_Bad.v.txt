VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the address is equal to a constant value and assigns a value of 1 if it is. This is a hardcoded value and can be easily bypassed by an attacker. It is recommended to use a more secure method for checking the address, such as a comparison against a list of allowed addresses.
