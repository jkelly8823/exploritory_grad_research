VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as it concatenates user input without proper sanitization. The input is not sanitized before being used in the LDAP query, allowing attackers to inject malicious code. To mitigate this, use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user input directly into the query.
