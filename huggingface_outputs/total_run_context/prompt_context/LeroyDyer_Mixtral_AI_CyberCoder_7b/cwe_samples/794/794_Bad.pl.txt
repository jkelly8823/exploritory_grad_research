VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to command injection as it does not sanitize the input before passing it to the ReadAndSendFile function. The regular expression only removes dots from the username, but does not remove other special characters. To fix this, input validation and sanitization should be performed before passing it to the function.
