VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a finite state machine with a lack of input validation, which can be exploited by an attacker to enter invalid inputs and cause undefined states, leading to a DoS attack or privilege escalation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation and error handling to prevent invalid inputs from being processed. Use a well-defined state machine
