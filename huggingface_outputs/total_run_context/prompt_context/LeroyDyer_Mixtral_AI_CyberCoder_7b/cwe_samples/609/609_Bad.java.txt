EXPLANATION: The code uses double-checked locking, which is a technique to avoid the overhead of explicit synchronization, but it is not sufficient. The double-checked locking can lead to race conditions and data races. It is recommended to use the more robust double-checked initialization pattern or the more modern double-checked initialization pattern instead.
