VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to privilege escalation as it does not check the ownership of the process before killing it. An attacker could potentially kill processes that they are not authorized to kill.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should check the user privileges before killing a process to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to kill the process.
