EXPLANATION: The code uses the LookPath method to find the executable file, which is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker could potentially supply a path that is outside the intended directory, allowing them to execute arbitrary code. To mitigate this, use a whitelist of allowed directories or sanitize the input.
