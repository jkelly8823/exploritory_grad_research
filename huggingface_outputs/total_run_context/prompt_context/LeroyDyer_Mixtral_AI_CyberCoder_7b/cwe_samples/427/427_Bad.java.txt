EXPLANATION:
The use of the System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method to execute the "make" command is a potential security risk as it allows the execution of arbitrary commands on the system. This can be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code. It is recommended to use a whitelist of allowed commands and paths to restrict the search path.
