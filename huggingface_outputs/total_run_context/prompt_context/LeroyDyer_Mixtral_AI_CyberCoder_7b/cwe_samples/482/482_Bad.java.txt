VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an assignment statement (foo = 1) instead of a comparison statement (foo == 1) in the if statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The correct code should be if (foo == 1) {...} to compare the value of foo to 1.
