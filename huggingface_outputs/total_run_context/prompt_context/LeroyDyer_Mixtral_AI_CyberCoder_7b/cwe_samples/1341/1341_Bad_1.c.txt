EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential memory leak vulnerability. The malloc call is not wrapped in a try-catch block, so if an exception is thrown, the memory will not be freed. The free call will still be executed even if the malloc call fails, leading to memory leakage. To fix this, the malloc call should
