EXPLANATION: The code opens the file twice, once in the if statement and once outside the if statement. The second call to fclose() is unnecessary and can lead to undefined behavior. The correct code should only have one call to fclose().
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the second call to fclose() and ensure that the file is closed
