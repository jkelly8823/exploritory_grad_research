VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12

The code contains a division by zero vulnerability. The division by zero can cause an ArithmeticException, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The recommended fix is to add a check for zero before dividing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check to ensure that b is not zero before divid
