VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the DES encryption algorithm which is considered insecure due to its block cipher mode (ECB) and key size. It is recommended to use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a random IV and a strong key.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES with a random IV and
