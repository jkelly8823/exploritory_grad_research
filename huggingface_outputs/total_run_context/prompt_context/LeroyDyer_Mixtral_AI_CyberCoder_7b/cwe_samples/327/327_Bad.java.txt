VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The use of DES encryption is considered insecure due to its weak key length and lack of security features. It is recommended to use stronger encryption algorithms such as AES or RSA.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES or RSA instead of DES.
