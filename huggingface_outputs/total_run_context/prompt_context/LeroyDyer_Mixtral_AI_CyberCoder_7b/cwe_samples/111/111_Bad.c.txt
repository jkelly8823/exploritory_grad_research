VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3, 4
EXPLANATION: The code imports the Java Native Interface (JNI) and calls a C function that can be vulnerable to buffer overflow. The use of gets() is dangerous as it does not check the length of the input, which can lead to buffer overflow. The use of printf() is also dangerous as it can lead to format string vulnerabilities.
