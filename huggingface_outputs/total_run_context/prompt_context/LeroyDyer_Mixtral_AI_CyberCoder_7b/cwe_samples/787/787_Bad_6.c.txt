VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the strcpy function is used without checking the length of the source string and destination buffer. The result of strstr() is directly used as an offset to copy the source string into the destination buffer without bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The correct way to use strcpy() is to
