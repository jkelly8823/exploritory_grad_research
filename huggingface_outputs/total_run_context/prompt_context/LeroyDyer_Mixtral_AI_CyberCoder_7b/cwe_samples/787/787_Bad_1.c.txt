VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12, 15-17
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it writes data past the end of the buffer. The function returnChunkSize() returns the size of the chunk, but the memory allocation is not checked before writing to destBuf. This can lead to buffer overflow. The function should return an error code instead of writing to destBuf
