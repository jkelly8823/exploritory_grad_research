VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a memory leak because the free() function is called on ap[4] instead of ap, which is a pointer to a pointer. The correct call should be free(ap) to release the memory allocated for the entire array. The correct call would be free(ap). This will lead to memory leakage
