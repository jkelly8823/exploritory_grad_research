VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the size of the input string before allocating memory for it. The malloc() call does not take into account the size of the input string, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. The correct approach would be to use a dynamic
