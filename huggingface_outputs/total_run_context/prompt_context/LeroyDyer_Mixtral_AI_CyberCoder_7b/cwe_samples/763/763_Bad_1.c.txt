VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to memory leakage as it fails to properly free the allocated memory when the search fails. The memory is not freed, leading to a memory leak. The correct way to handle this would be to use a try-catch block or a return statement to ensure that the memory is freed regardless of the search result.
