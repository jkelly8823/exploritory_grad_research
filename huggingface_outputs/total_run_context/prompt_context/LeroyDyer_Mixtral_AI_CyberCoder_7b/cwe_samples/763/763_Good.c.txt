VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a memory leak vulnerability. The code allocates memory using malloc() but does not properly free it when the function returns. This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion. The correct way to handle this would be to use a pointer to a local variable and use free() to release the memory after the function returns.
