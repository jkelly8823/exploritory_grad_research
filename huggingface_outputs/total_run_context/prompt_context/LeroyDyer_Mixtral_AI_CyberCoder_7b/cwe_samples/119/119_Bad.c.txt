VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it copies the hostname from the gethostbyaddr function into the hostname array without checking the size of the array. The function call does not return the size of the hostname, so the programmer assumes the size of the hostname to be 64 bytes. This can lead to buffer overflow
