VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8, 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the index value before accessing the array. The index value is not validated before accessing the array, which can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior. The program may read or write outside the array's bounds, leading to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities
