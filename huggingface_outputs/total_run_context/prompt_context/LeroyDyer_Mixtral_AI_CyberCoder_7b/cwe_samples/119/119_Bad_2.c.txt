VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses an untrusted input (index-1) to access an array index without bounds checking. The index is not checked before accessing the array items[index] which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. The correct way to access the array would be to check the index against the array bounds before access
