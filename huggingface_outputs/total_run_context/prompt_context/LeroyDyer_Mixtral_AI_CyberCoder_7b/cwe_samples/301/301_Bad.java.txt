VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection as it does not properly sanitize user input. The command variable is directly concatenated into the command string without any input validation or sanitization. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Sanitize user input and use prepared statements or parameterized queries
