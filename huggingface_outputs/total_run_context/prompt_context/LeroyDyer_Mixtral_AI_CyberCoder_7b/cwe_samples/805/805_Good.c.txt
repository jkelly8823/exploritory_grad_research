VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the strncpy function to copy a string from source to dest, but the size of dest is incorrectly calculated. The size of dest is calculated as the size of dest minus one. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability as the function will attempt to write one byte past the end of the buffer, which can result in memory corruption
