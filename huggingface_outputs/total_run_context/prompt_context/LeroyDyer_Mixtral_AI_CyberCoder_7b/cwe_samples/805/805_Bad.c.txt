VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses a fixed size buffer (hostname) to store the result of a function (inet_addr) that can return a larger value than the buffer size. The function inet_addr() returns the size of the buffer in bytes, but the size of the buffer is not checked before the strcpy()
