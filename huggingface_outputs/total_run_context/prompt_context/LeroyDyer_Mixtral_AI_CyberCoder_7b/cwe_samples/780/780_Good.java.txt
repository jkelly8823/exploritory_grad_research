VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code uses the RSA algorithm without OAEP padding, which is not recommended due to its security weaknesses. OAEP padding is recommended for RSA encryption. The code should use OAEP padding instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use OAEP padding for RSA encryption to improve security.
