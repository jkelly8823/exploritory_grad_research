EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow. The variable nresp is incremented with the value of packet_get_int() which can result in an integer overflow. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. To fix this, the code should check the value of nresp before allocating memory for the response array and use a safe integer type
