VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the size of the source buffer to determine the number of characters to be copied, but it does not check the length of the source string. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the source string is longer than the size of the source buffer. The correct way to copy strings is to use the strncpy_s function instead
