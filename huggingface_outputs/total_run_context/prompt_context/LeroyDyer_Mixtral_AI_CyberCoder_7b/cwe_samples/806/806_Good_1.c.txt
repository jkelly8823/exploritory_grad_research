VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses the size of the buffer without checking the length of the filename before copying it to the buffer. The size of the buffer is hardcoded and does not take into account the null terminator. This can lead to overwriting memory outside the buffer, which can cause security vulnerabilities.
