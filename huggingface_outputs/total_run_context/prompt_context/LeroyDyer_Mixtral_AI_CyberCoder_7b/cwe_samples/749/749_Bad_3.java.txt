EXPLANATION: The getUserInfo() method is vulnerable to CWE-749 as it returns the currentUser.Info() without any input validation or sanitization. This could lead to information disclosure if the currentUser object contains sensitive data. To mitigate this, input validation and sanitization should be performed before returning the result.
