EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference as the subtraction of two pointers can result in an incorrect value if the pointers are not in the same memory chunk. This can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption. To fix this, the code should check that both pointers point to the same memory region before performing the subtr
