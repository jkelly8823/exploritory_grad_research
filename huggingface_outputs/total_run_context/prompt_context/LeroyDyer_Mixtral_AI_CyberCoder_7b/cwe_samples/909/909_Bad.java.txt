VULNERABLE: YESVULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5EXPLANATION: The code does not initialize the variable 'initialized' before checking its value. This can lead to unintended behavior or undefined behavior. The variable 'initialized' can contain any value, including false, which would cause the code to skip the initialization tasks. To fix this, initialize the variable to a known value, such as 'false' before the if statement.RECOMMEND
