VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code uses a predictable algorithm to generate a pseudo-random number, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. To fix this, use a cryptographically secure random number generator instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator such as /dev/urandom or /dev/random to generate random numbers.
