EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a try-catch block without a finally block, which means that resources such as file handles, network connections, or other system resources are not guaranteed to be closed properly. This can lead to memory leaks or other resource leaks, which can be exploited by attackers to exhaust system resources.
