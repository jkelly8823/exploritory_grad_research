VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a union to store a string and an integer, but then tries to access the string as an integer. This is a type punning vulnerability. The correct way to access the string would be to use a cast to a char * or a pointer to char. The code should use a char * for the name variable.
