VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it attempts to store a value in a variable without checking its size. The pointer arithmetic operation can lead to memory corruption and unintended behavior. The correct way to allocate memory for the variable a would be to use malloc or a similar function to allocate memory for the variable.
