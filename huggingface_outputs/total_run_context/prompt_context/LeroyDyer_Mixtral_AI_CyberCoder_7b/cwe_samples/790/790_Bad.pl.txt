EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to command injection as it does not sanitize the input before passing it to the ReadAndSendFile function. The regular expression used to filter out the "." character is not sufficient to prevent command injection. To fix this, input validation and sanitization should be performed before passing the input to the function.
