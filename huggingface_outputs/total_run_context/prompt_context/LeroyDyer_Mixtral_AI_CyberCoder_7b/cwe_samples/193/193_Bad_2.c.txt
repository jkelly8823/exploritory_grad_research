VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it uses a fixed size buffer without bounds checking. The buffer is not checked for the length of the input string, which can lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer boundary. The input string is read into the buffer without checking its length. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
