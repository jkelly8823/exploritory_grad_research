VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The use of long primitive type for the variable count may introduce inefficiencies into performance-critical operations. It is recommended to use int or other more appropriate data types for integer arithmetic operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use int instead of long for the variable count to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
