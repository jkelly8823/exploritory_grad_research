VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The use of long primitive type for the variable count may introduce inefficiencies into performance-critical operations. It is recommended to use int or short instead. Long type has a larger memory footprint and slower arithmetic operations compared to int or short. Using int or short can improve performance and reduce memory usage.
