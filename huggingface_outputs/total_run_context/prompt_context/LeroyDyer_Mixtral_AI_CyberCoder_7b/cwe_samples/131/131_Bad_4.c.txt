VULNERABLE: YES

EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the allocated memory before assigning values to the array, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The size of the allocated memory should be checked to ensure it is large enough to store the values. The correct way to allocate memory would be to use malloc(3 * sizeof(int)) to allocate space for three integers
