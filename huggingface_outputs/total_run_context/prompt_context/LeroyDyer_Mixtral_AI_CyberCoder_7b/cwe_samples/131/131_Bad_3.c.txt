EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the size of the packet before allocating memory for the headers. The size of the packet is not checked before allocating memory for the headers, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the packet size is larger than the allocated memory. To fix this, the code should check the size of
