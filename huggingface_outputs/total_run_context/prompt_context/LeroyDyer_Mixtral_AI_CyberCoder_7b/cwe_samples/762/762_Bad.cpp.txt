VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using the new operator, but attempts to free memory using the free function. The correct function to free memory allocated by new is delete. The correct code would be: delete ptr;

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The correct code would be:
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj();
