VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the uv_getaddrinfo() function, which can lead to out-of-bounds read and information disclosure. The function is not checked for buffer overflow, allowing the pointer p to be read beyond the end of the buffer. This can result in information disclosure or crashes.
