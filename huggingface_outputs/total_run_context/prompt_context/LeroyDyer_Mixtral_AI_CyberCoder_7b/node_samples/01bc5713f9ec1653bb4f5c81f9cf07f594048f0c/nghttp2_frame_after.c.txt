VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the nghttp2_ext_altsvc function. The function is not checking the length of the altsvc->field_value string before copying it into the altsvc->origin buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is longer than the buffer size
