VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the host is an empty string, an IP address, or if it is either "localhost" or "localhost6". This is a vulnerability because it does not check if the host is a valid domain name. An attacker can use "localhost6" to bypass the check and perform DNS rebinding attacks.
