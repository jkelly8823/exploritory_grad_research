VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-18
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function ares_free_data() due to the use of pointer arithmetic operations without bounds checking. The pointer arithmetic operations performed on dataptr can lead to memory access outside of the allocated memory block, which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite
