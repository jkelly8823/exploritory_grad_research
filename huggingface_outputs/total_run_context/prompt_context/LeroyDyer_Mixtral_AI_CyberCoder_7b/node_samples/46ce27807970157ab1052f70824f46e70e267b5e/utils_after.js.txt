EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to the use of Buffer.from() on the result of path.resolve() which can be monkey-patched to modify the result of path.resolve(). The recommended fix is to use a C++ binding instead of Buffer.from() to encode the result of path.resolve() to
