VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the multiplication operation, which could lead to out-of-bounds accesses to the array. The if statement checks for overflow but does not prevent it. Recommendations include using a safer multiplication function or limiting the multiplication to a specific range.
