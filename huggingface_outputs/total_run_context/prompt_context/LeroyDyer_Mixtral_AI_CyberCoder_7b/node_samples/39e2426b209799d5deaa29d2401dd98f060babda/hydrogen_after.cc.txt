EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the multiplication operation, which could lead to out-of-bounds accesses to the array. The multiplication of a constant value by a signed integer may result in an integer overflow, causing the result to exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the integer type. This could lead to
