VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It appears to be a simple command line tool for parsing command line arguments. The only potential vulnerability is the lack of input validation, which is not explicitly shown in the code snippet. However, it is recommended to validate input to prevent unexpected input from being passed to functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Input validation
