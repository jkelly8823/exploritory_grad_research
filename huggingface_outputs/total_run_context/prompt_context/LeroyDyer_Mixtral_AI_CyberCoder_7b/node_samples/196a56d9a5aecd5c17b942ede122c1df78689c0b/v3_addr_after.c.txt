EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows in the IPAddressOrRange_new() function. The buffer overflow could result in a crash (denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. The buffer overflow occurs when the prefixlen is greater than the length of the string. The buffer overflow can be triggered by a malicious server or client.
