VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It checks for the FIPS module and disables the continuous RNG tests when it is enabled. It also checks whether the default rand_method is RAND_OpenSSL() and tests the reseeding of shared DRBGs. It also checks whether the primary DRBG is reseeded in FIPS mode.
