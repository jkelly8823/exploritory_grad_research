VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the join function without bounds checking. The join function can overflow the buffer if the input string is too long. This can lead to a crash or potential remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method to concatenate strings, such as sprintf or use a fixed-size buffer
