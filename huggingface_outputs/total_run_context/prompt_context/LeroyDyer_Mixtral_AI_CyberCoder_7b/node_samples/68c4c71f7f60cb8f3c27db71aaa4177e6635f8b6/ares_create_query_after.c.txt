VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-20
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the length of the name parameter. The code does not check the length of the name parameter before copying it into the buffer, allowing an attacker to potentially write beyond the buffer bounds and overwrite memory. This could lead to a denial of service or code execution
