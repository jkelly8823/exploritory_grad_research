VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-18
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the use of an integer variable to store the length of data to be read from the input stream. The integer variable is not checked for overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large input length. This can lead to memory corruption and a denial of service.
