VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the lack of bounds checking on the length parameter passed to BUF_MEM_new function. The function does not check the input length before allocating memory, allowing an attacker to pass a malicious input that exceeds the buffer size, resulting in memory corruption and potential denial of
