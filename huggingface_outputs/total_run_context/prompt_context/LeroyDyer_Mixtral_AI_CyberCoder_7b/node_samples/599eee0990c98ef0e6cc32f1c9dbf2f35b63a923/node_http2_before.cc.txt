VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION: The code does not appear to be vulnerable to resource loops. It checks for an empty buffer before emitting data, and uses a single large array buffer to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code checks for an empty buffer before emitting data, and uses a single large array buffer to avoid unnecessary memory allocations. This reduces the risk of resource loops and memory usage.
