VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the input buffer for the NAPTR record in the `ares_parse_naptr_reply()` function. An attacker could craft a malicious NAPTR record to read memory outside of the buffer, which could lead to arbitrary
