VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the ROUND_UP function, which can lead to memory corruption and potential memory exhaustion. The use of the CHECK_LT function without bounds checking can also lead to buffer overflow. The use of the Extra function without bounds checking can lead to memory corruption.
