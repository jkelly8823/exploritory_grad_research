VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the permission model is enabled and then checks if the path is a string or a Uint8Array. If it is a string, it calls resolvePath directly. If it is a Uint8Array, it converts it to a Buffer using BufferFrom and then calls resolvePath. This is a potential path traversal vulnerability
