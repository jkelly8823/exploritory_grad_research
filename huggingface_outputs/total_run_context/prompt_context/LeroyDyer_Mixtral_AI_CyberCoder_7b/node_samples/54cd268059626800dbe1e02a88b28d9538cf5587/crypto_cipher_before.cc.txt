VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to the Marvin attack because it does not check the padding value before performing RSA decryption. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. To fix this, the code should check the padding value before decrypting the RSA key.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the
