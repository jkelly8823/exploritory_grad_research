VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2018-0735 vulnerability as it does not involve the OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm. The code is not performing any signing operations and does not use the ECDSA algorithm. It is only performing arithmetic operations on integers.
