VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION: The code does not contain the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability as it does not implement the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback function. The code only initializes the options buffer with default values. It does not implement the workaround to drop the connection if the number of settings entries is large.
