VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code sample shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `Buffer.alloc()` method, which can lead to the return of uninitialized memory. The third argument `encoding` is misinterpreted as the `start` parameter for the `fill` operation, allowing an attacker to potentially access sensitive information. To mitigate this,
