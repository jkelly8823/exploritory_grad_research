VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION: The code sample demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the Buffer.alloc() method with an invalid argument type. The first argument is a number, which is interpreted as the length of the buffer, but the second argument is a string, which is not a valid type for Buffer.alloc(). This can lead to uninitialized memory being
