VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a for loop that iterates through the entire Object.prototype array, which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the array bounds. The use of a raw pointer to the array can lead to memory corruption and potential code execution.
