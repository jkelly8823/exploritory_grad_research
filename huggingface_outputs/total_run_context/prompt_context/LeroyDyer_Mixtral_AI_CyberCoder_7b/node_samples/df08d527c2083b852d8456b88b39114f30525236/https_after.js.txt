VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code sets the keepAliveTimeout, maxHeadersCount, and requestTimeout to values that are too high, which can be exploited by attackers to send a large number of requests to the server, causing a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Lower the values to reasonable limits to prevent such attacks.
