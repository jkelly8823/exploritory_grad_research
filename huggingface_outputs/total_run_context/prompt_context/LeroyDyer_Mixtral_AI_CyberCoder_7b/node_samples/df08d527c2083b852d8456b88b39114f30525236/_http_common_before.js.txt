EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the incoming message and headers. The code does not check the length of the incoming message and headers, which can allow attackers to send large amounts of data to the server, causing it to become unresponsive.
