EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to the lack of input validation on the content-length header. An attacker can send a malformed header with a space before the content-length header to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first request.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate input on the content-length header
