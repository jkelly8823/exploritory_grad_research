VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `reinterpret_cast` operator to convert a pointer to a uint16_t pointer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability as the size calculation is based on the size of a uint16_t, which is smaller than the size of the buffer. The
