VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the encoding is not UCS-2, but it does not check for the length of the input string. An attacker can pass a long string to Buffer.write() to write outside the buffer bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a length check before writing to Buffer.write() to prevent buffer overflow.
