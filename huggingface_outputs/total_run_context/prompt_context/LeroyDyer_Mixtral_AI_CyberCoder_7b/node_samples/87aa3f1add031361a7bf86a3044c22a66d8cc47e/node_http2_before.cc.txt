VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code checks for the END_STREAM flag in the frame header, but it does not check for the length of the frame. An attacker can send empty frames to consume CPU resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Check the length of the frame before checking for END_STREAM flag. If the length is zero, treat it as an error
