EXPLANATION:
The code uses the assert.strictEqual() method to compare the output of the command execution with the expected value 'true\n'. However, this method is not recommended as it throws an error if the values are not strictly equal. Instead, use the assert.equal() method which is more flexible and allows for type coercion.
