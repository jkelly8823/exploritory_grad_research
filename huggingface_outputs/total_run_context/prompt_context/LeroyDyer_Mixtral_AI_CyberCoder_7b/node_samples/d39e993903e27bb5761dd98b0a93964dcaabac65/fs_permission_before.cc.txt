VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the path starts with "\\" and if it does, it removes the first 4 characters and then performs a lookup. This is a potential security vulnerability as it could be used to bypass the intended path traversal protection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a more secure method to handle UNC paths
