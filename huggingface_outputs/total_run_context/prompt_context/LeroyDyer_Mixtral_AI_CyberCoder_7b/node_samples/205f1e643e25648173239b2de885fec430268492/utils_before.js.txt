EXPLANATION: The code checks if the permission model is enabled and if the path is a string. If the permission model is enabled and the path is not absolute, it resolves the path using pathModule.resolve(). This can lead to potential path traversal vulnerabilities as the path can be manipulated to access files outside the intended directory.
