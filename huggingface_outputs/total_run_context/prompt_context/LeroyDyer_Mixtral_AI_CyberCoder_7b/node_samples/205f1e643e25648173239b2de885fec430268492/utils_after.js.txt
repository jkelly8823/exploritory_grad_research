EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the permission model is enabled and then checks if the path is a string. If it is a string, it resolves the path using the path module. This can lead to potential path traversal vulnerabilities as the path is not sanitized. It is recommended to sanitize user input and validate the path before resolving it.
