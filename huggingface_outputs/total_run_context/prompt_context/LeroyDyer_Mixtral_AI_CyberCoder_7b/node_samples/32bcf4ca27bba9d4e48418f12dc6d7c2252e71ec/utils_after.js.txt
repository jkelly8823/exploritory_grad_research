VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the path.resolve function without proper input validation and sanitization. The function is not protected against path traversal attacks, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The recommendation is to implement the path.resolve function on the C++ side and validate user input to prevent potential
