EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the definition of an enumeration type with two values, FLAGS_MIN_VALUE and FLAGS_MAX_VALUE, which are hardcoded and not defined as constants. This can lead to potential integer overflows or buffer overflows if the values are not checked properly. It is recommended to use named constants instead
