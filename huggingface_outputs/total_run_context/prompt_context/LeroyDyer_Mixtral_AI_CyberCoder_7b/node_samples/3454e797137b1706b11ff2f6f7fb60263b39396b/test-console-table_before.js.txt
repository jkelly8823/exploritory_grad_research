EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to the use of the "console.table()" function, which allows user-controlled input to be passed to the "properties" parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter. The prototype pollution has limited control, as it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys
