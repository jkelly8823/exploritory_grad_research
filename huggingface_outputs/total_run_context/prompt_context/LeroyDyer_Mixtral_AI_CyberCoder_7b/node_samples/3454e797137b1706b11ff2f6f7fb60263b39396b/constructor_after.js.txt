EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to prototype pollution as it allows user controlled input to be passed to the "properties" parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be "__proto__". This can lead to the modification of the prototype of the object being assigned to. Node.js >= 12.22.9
