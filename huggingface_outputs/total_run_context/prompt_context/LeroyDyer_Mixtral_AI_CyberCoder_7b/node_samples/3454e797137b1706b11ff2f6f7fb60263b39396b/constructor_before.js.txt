EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to prototype pollution as it allows user controlled input to be passed to the "properties" parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter. The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the object prototype. Node.js >= 12.
