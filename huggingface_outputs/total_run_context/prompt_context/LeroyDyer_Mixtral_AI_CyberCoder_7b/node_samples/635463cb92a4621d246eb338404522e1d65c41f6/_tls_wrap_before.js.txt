VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the "rejectUnauthorized" parameter is defined and if it is true, it calls the "destroy" method to terminate the connection. However, if it is undefined, it does not return an error. This could allow for connections to servers with expired certificates to be accepted, which is a security vulnerability
