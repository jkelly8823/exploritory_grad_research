EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to DNS amplification attacks. The code does not limit the number of DNS queries, allowing an attacker to send a large number of requests to the server, which can lead to a Denial of Service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a rate limiting mechanism to restrict the number of DNS queries to prevent abuse
