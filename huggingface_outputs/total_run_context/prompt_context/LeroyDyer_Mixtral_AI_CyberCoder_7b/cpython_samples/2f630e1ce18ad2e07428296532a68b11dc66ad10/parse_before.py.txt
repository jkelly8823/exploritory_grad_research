EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a function call to replace all occurrences of the bytes in the string with an empty string, which could potentially be used to remove certain characters from the input string. This could be used to bypass URL parsing restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a regular expression to remove the specified bytes instead of a simple replace method
