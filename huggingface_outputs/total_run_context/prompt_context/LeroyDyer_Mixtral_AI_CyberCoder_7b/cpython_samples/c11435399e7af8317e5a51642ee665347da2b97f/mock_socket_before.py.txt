VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the pop() method which removes the first element from the list without checking its size. This can lead to index out of range errors and potential memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the pop() method with a check to ensure the list is not empty before removing elements.
