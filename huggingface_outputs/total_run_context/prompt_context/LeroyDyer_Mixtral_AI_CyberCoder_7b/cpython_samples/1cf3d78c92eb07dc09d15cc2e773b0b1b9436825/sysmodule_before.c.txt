EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function sys_get_int_max_str_digits_impl() which returns the maximum number of digits allowed in a string conversion to an integer. The function is vulnerable to integer overflows due to the use of int() and int.from_bytes() functions which have quadratic time complexity for non
