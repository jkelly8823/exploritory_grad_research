VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13, 15-18, 20-23
EXPLANATION: The code contains a vulnerability related to the parsing of cookies with backslashes in their value. The parser uses an algorithm with quadratic complexity, which can lead to excessive CPU resource usage. This can be mitigated by using a more efficient parsing algorithm or implementing input
