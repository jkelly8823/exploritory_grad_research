VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-15
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability related to the parsing of cookies with backslashes in their value. The use of regular expressions to parse the cookie value may lead to excessive CPU usage due to the quadratic complexity of the algorithm. This could potentially be improved by using a more efficient parsing method or a library function for parsing
