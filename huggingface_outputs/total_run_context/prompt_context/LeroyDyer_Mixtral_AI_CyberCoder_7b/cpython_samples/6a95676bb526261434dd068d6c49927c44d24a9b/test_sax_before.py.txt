VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of a large input string that causes multiple buffer fills, leading to resource consumption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more robust parsing library or implementing input validation and error handling to limit the size of input strings.
