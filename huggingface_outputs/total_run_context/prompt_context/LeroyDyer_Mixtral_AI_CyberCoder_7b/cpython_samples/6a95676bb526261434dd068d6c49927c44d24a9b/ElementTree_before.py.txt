VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the XML parsing function. The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow issue, where the parser is not properly handling large input strings, leading to resource consumption and a denial of service attack. The code should be updated to implement proper input validation and error handling to prevent such attacks.
