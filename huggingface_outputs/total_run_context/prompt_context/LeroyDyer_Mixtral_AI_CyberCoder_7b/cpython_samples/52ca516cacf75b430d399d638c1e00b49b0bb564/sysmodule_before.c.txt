VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, as it does not check the input of argv[0] for a path separator. An attacker can pass an empty string as argv[0] to prepend an empty string to sys.path, which allows them to execute arbitrary code in the current working directory.
