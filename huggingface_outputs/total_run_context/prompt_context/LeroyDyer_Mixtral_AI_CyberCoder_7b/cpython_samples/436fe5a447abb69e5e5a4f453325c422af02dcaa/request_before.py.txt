VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP_PROXY variable name clash, which could allow a remote attacker to redirect HTTP requests. The code does not check if the name variable is a valid proxy name, allowing an attacker to set the value of the proxies dictionary.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a whitelist of valid proxy names
