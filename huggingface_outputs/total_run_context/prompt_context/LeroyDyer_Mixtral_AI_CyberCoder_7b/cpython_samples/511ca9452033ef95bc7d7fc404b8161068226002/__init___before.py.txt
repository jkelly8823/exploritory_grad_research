VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the int() function to convert a string to an integer, which has quadratic time complexity when parsing large integers. This can lead to a denial of service attack by sending large strings to the function, causing the system to become unresponsive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use int.from_bytes() instead of int
