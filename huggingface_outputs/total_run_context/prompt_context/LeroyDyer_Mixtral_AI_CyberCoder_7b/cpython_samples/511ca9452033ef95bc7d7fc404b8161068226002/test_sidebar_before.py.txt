VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the '+' operator in the input statement. The '+' operator can be used to concatenate strings, but it can also be used to execute arbitrary code. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the input string, which could lead to code injection and execution of arbitrary commands.
