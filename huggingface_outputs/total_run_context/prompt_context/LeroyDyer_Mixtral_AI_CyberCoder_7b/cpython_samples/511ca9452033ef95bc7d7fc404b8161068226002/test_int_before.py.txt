VULNERABLE_LINES: 114
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The conversion of a string to an integer can lead to a large integer value, which can cause a stack overflow and crash the system. To mitigate this, use a safer method like int(base=2) or int(base=2) to limit the base to 2.
