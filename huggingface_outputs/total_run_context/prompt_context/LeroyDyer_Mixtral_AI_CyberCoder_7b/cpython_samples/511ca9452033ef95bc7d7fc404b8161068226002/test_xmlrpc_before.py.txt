VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. The use of int() function can cause integer overflows, which can lead to memory corruption and system crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method for parsing integers, such as int(text, base=1
