VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-15
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the Python implementation of int() function, which can lead to a memory exhaustion attack. The function is vulnerable to integer overflows, which can cause a denial of service attack. The function does not check the length of the input string, allowing an attacker to pass a large string to the
