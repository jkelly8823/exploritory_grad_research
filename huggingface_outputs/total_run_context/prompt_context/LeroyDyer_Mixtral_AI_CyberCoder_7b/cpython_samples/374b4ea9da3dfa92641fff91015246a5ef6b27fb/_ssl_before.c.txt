VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code uses SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL) which enables all SSL options, including CBC mode, which is vulnerable to BEAST attacks. The verification_mode is set to SSL_VERIFY_NONE, which disables certificate verification. This combination makes the code vulnerable to BEAST attacks.
