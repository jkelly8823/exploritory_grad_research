VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the last dimension of the source and destination buffers are contiguous. However, it does not check if the number of dimensions is the same. This could lead to undefined behavior if the dimensions are different.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Check the number of dimensions before checking for contiguity.
