EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a switch statement that switches on the byte type and increments the pointer ptr based on the byte type. The switch statement is not properly handled, which can lead to a buffer over-read vulnerability. The code does not check the validity of the pointer or the end pointer, which can result in a buffer over-
