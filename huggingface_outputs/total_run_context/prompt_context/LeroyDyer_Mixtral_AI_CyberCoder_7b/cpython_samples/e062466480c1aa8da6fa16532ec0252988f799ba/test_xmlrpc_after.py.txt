VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the SimpleXMLRPCServer.py script. The server is not waiting for the socket timeout, which can lead to a denial of service attack by sending a partial POST request with a smaller amount of data than specified by the Content-Length header. This can cause an infinite loop and CPU consumption.
