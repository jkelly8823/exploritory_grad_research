VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a buffer over-read vulnerability due to the use of XML_GetCurrentLineNumber() and XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber() functions, which can be exploited by crafted XML input to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer XML parser library or implement input validation
