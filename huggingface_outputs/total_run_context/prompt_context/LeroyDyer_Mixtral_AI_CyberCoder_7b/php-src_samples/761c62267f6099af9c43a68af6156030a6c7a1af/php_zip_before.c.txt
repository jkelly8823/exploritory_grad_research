VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the length of the path_cleaned variable before passing it to the zip_stat() function, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the path_cleaned variable is longer than MAXPATHLEN. To fix this, the code should check the length of path_cleaned before passing it to zip_stat()
