VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the calculation of the length of the path_translated variable, which is used to allocate memory for the path_translated string. The calculation does not consider operator precedence, which could allow an attacker to craft a malicious URI to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the length of the PATH
