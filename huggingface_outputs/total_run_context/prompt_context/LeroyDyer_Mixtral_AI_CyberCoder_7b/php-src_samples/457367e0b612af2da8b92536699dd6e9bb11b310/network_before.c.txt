VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a function call to gethostbyname() which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function call is not thread-safe and can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code. The function call is not checked for buffer overflow, allowing attackers to overwrite memory and potentially execute code on the stack.
