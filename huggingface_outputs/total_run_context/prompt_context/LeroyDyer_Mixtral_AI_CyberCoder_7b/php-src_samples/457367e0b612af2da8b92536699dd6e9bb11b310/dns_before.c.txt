EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the gethostbyname() function, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. The function call can be used to overwrite the heap memory, leading to a buffer overflow. To fix this, the code should use a safer alternative such
