EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value of gdImageCreateTrueColor() and gdImageCreate(), which could lead to a NULL pointer being returned. This could cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. To mitigate this, the code should check the return value of these functions and return an error if NULL is returned
