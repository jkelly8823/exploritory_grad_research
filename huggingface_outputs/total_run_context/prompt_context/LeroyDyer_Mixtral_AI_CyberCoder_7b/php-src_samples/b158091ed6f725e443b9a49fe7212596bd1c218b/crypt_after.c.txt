VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for specific salt values to determine the encryption algorithm used, which is a known vulnerability in crypt_blowfish. The salt values are hardcoded and can be easily guessed, allowing attackers to determine the encryption algorithm and potentially decrypt passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a random salt generation function
