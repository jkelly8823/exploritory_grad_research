VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule. This vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-73
