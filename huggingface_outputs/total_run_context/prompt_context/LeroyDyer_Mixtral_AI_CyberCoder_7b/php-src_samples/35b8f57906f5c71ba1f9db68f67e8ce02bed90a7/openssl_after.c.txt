VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the input string before parsing it. An attacker can craft a malicious input string to overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe parsing function to parse the input string and validate the length before parsing it
