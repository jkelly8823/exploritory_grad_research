VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential stack out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the function forward_search_range() due to an invalid pointer dereference. The variable q is dereferenced without checking if it is within the valid range. This could lead to a buffer overflow, which could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
