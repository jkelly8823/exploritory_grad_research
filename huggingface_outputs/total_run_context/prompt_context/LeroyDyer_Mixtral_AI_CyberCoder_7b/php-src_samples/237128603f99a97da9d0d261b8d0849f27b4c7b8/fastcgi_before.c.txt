VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function call, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The function call does not check the size of the input string, allowing a potential attacker to pass a large input string that overflows the buffer and execute code on the stack.
