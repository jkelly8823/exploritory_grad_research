VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the call to gethostbyname() function, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The function call does not check the length of the input string, allowing a malicious input to overwrite the stack and execute code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use input validation and bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow
