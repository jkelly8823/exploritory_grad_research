VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the gethostbyname() function, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. The function call does not check the size of the buffer, allowing an attacker to pass a large input string that overflows the buffer and execute code
