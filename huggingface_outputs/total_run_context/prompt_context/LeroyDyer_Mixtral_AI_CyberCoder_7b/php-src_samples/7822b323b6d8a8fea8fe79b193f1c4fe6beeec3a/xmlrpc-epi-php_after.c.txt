VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as it does not check if method_name is NULL before dereferencing it. This can lead to a denial of service and other unspecified impact. To fix this, the code should check if method_name is not NULL before dereferencing it.
