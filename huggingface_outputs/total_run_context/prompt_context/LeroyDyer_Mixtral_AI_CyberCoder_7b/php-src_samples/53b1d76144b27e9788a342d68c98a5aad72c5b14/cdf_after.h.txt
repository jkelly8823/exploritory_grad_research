VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code does not restrict the number of CDF_VECTOR elements, which allows a heap-based buffer overflow (4-byte out-of-bounds write. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the code should implement bounds checking and limit the number of CDF_VECTOR elements to a safe value
