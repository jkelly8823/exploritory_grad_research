VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION: The code uses the compact() function which is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability. The function does not process the complete cleartext password if it contains a 0x80 character, allowing attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password.
