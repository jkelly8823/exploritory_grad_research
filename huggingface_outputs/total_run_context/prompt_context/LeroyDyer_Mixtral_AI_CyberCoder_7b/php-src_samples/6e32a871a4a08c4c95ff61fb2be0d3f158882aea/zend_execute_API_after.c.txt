VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the PHP script. The use of the EG() function without bounds checking can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, which can cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. To fix this, the code should include bounds checking and input validation to prevent the overflow.
