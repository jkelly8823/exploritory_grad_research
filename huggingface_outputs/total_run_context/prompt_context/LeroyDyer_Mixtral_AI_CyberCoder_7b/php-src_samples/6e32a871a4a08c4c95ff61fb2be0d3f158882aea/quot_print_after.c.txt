VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of unsafe arithmetic operations on pointers. The calculation of the memory allocation is not safe and can lead to a buffer overflow. The use of unsafe arithmetic operations on pointers can result in memory corruption and a potential security vulnerability.
