VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5,6,7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the pg_insert() function which can accept a large input without proper input validation. The input is not sanitized before being passed to the function, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious data into the function and cause a buffer overflow.
