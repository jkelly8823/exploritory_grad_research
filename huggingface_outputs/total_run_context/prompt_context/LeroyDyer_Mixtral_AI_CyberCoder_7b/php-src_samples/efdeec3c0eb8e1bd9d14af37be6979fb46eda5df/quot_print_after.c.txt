VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows a buffer overflow vulnerability in the PHP function php_quot_print_encode. The function allocates memory for the output string, but does not check the length of the input string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than expected. This can result in a crash or potential memory corruption.
