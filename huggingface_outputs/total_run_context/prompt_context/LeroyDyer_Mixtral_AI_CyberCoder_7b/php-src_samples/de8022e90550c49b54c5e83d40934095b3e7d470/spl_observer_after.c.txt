VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION: The code contains a use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of zval_ptr_dtor() function which can lead to memory corruption and potential memory leaks. The use of this function can lead to memory leaks and buffer overflows. It is recommended to use a safer alternative such as zend_object_unref()
