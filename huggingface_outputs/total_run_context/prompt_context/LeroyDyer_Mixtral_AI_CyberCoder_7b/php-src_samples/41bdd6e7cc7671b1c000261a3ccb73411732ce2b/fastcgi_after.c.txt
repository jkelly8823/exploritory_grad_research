EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the call to gethostbyname() function, which can be exploited by a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary code. The function call to gethostbyname() can be used to resolve a hostname to an IP address, but the function call does not check the length of the hostname input.
