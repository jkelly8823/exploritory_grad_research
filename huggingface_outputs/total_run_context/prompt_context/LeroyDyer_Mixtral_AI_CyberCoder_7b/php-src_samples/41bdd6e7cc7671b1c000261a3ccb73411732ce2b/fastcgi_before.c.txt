VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the call to gethostbyname() function, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The function call does not check the size of the input string, allowing an attacker to pass a large input string that overflows the buffer and execute code on the stack.
