VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not properly parse the length of the timestr string, which can lead to memory corruption and potential execution of arbitrary code. The function does not check the length of the input string before parsing it, allowing an attacker to provide a crafted input that exceeds the buffer size, resulting in
