VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-4
EXPLANATION:
The code checks the OS and skips the execution of the function if the OS is Windows. This is a security bypass, as it allows the attacker to bypass the intended security measure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should check for the OS and then execute the function only on Unix-based systems.
