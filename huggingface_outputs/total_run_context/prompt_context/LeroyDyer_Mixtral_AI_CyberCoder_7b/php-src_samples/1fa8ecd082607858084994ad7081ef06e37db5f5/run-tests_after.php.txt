VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the function write_information() which does not check the length of the input before writing it to a file. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer alternative to write_information() or implement input validation and sanitization to prevent buffer overflow.
