VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the function file_printf without bounds checking. The function call to file_printf may write more bytes than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in a crash or denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking and input
