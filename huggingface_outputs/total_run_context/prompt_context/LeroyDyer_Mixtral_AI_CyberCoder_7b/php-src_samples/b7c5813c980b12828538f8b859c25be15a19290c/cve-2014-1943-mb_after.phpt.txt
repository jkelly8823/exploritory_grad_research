VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the format string vulnerability. The format string "%s" can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious input that overflows the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer format string function or input validation to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
