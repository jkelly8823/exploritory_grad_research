VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the file_printf function which does not check the length of the input string. An attacker can craft a specially crafted input string to cause a denial of service by overwriting the stack and causing infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash.
