VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a recursive function call without a limit on the size of the string being processed. An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by providing a large input string that exceeds the maximum stack size, leading to a stack overflow and crash.
