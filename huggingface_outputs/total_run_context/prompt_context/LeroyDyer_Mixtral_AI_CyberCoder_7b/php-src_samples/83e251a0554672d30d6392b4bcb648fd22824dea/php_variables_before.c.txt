VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the variable 'var_name' is not checked for length before being copied into 'p'. This can lead to a potential stack overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated memory. To fix this, the code should check the length of 'var_name' before copying it into 'p'.
