VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code sample shows a function call to zend_object_value with a potential security vulnerability. The function call is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of input validation on the input parameters. The function does not check the size of the input string, which could lead to a buffer overflow attack. To fix this, input validation should be added
