VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to a function that is known to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function call does not include any bounds checking on the input, which can lead to a potential stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add bounds checking to the input parameters to prevent buffer overflow. Use a safer implementation of
