VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the input string before copying it to the destination buffer, which can lead to overwriting memory beyond the allocated space. This can result in a stack overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safe string copy function like strn
