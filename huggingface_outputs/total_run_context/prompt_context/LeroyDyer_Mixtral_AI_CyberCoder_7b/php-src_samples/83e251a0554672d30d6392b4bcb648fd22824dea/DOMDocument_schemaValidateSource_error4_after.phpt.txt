VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to XSS attack due to the lack of input validation on the $data variable. The user input is directly inserted into the DOMDocument constructor without sanitization.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Sanitize user input before using it in the DOMDocument constructor. Use prepared statements or other input validation techniques to prevent XSS attacks.
