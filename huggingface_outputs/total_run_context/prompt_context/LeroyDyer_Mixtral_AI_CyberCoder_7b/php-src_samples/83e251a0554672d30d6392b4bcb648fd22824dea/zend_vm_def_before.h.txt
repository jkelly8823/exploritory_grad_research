VULNERABLE: NO
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any code that directly handles certificates or SSL/TLS functionality, so it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-4073. However, it does not mean that the code is completely secure against man-in-the-middle attacks. It is recommended to use secure SSL/TLS libraries and protocols to ensure secure communication.
