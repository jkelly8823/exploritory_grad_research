VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a denial of service and application crash. To fix this, the code should check if comment is not NULL before attempting to return the string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a null check before returning the string to prevent the dereference.
