EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the lack of a limit on the amount of data read from a file. This can cause excessive CPU consumption and crash the application. The regex search is not properly restricted, allowing an attacker to craft a file that triggers backtracking during processing.
