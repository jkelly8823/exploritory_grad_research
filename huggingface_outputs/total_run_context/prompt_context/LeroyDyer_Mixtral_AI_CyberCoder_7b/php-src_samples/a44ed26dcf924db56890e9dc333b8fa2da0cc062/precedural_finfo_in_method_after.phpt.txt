VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 28
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization. The regular expression used in the awk command does not limit the amount of data read, allowing an attacker to potentially trigger a backtracking loop and consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to a denial of service.
