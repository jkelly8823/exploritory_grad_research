EXPLANATION: The code does not restrict the number of CDF_VECTOR elements, which allows a heap-based buffer overflow (4-byte out-of-bounds write. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the code should implement a check on the number of elements in the CDF_VECTOR array to prevent
