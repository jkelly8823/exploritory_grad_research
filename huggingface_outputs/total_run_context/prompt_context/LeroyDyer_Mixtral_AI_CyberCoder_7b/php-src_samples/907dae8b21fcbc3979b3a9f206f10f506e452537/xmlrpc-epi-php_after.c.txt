VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13

The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as it does not check if method_name is NULL before attempting to access its length. An attacker can craft a malicious XMLRPC request to cause a denial of service and application crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, add a null check before access
