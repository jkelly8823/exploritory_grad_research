VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference as it does not check if the memory allocation for colors is successful. If the allocation fails, the program will continue execution and attempt to access the memory location pointed by colors, which is undefined behavior. This can lead to a crash or memory corruption.
