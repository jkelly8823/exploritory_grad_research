VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation attack as it does not properly sanitize user input. The code does not validate the input before using it in the session_start() function call, allowing an attacker to manipulate the session ID. To fix this, input validation should be added to ensure only numeric input is accepted.
