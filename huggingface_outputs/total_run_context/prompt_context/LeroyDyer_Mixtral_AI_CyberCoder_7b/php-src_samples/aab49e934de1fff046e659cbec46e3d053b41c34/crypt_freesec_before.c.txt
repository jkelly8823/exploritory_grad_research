VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it does not check the length of the keybuf array before processing it with the des_setkey function. An attacker can pass a longer key string than the size of the keybuf array, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.
