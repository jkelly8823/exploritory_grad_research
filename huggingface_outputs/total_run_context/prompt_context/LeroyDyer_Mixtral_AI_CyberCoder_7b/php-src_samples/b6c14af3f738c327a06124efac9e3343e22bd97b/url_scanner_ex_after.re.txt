VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the input value before copying it into the encoded string. This can lead to a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safe function to encode the input value and check the length of the input string before copying it to the output buffer.
