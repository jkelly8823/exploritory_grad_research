VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to strtok() which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite the memory region containing the path variable. The function call does not check the length of the input string, allowing an attacker to pass a larger input than the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
