VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to a function that is known to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function call does not check the length of the input string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than expected. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
