VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any of the vulnerabilities typically associated with code injection or similar security risks. 

The code handles user input (`param`) by resolving it using a function `node::PathResolve`. This function likely performs necessary sanitization and normalization of the input path.

The code then conditionally checks for specific path patterns (UNC paths on Windows) and adjusts the path accordingly.
