VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly involve parsing HTTP requests or handling headers. It defines callback functions for an `llhttp_t` object, which is likely used for parsing HTTP requests. However, the code itself does not demonstrate any vulnerable parsing logic that would be susceptible to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) as described in the CVE IDs provided.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
