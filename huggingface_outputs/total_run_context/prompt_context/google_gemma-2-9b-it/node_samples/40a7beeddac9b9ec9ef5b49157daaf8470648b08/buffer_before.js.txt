VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet directly implements the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-7166. The `Buffer.alloc()` function allows the `encoding` argument to be a number, which is misinterpreted as the `start` parameter for the internal `_fill()` method. This can lead to uninitialized memory being returned if `fill` is not 0 or undefined.
