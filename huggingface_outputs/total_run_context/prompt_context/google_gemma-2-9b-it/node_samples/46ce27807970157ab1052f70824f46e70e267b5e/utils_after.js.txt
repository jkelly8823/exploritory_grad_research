VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample you provided implements a security measure to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. It explicitly avoids using `Buffer.from()` when resolving paths, which is the vulnerable point mentioned in the CVE description. Instead, it uses a C++ binding to encode the resolved path, mitigating the risk of monkey-patching `Buffer` internals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against
