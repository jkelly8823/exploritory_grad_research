VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19-25
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to memory corruption. The `TestMemoryCorruption` function attempts to read a string from a `napi_value` argument and store it in a fixed-size buffer (`buf`). If the input string exceeds the buffer size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can potentially allow an attacker
