VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly interact with HTTP/2 streams or handle RST_STREAM frames. It declares variables related to outgoing buffers and pending RST streams but does not demonstrate any logic for opening streams, sending requests, or processing RST_STREAM responses. Therefore, it is not susceptible to the CVE-2019-9514 reset flood vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
