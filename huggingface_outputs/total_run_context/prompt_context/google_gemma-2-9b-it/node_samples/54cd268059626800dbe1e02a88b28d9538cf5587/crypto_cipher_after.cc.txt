VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-16
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates the use of RSA decryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This padding scheme is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack (CVE-2023-46809) if OpenSSL is not patched. The vulnerability exists in the handling of RSA decryption with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding when using a private key.
