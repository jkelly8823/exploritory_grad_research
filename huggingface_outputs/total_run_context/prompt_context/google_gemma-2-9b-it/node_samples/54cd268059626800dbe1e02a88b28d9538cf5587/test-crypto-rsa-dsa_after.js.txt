VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize OpenSSL for RSA decryption. It relies on the Node.js built-in `crypto` module, which handles cryptographic operations. While Node.js can leverage OpenSSL under the hood, the code itself doesn't expose vulnerabilities related to unpatched OpenSSL versions or the Marvin Attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
