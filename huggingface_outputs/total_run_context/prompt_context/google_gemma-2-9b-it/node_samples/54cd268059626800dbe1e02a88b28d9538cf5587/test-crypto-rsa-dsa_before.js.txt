VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize OpenSSL or any functions that would be susceptible to the Marvin Attack. It leverages Node.js's built-in `crypto` module for RSA encryption and decryption. While the `crypto` module might internally rely on OpenSSL, the code itself doesn't expose vulnerabilities related to the specific attack vector described.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
