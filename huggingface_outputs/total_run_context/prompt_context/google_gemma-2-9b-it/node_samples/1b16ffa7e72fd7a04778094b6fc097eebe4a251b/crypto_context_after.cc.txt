VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize the `crypto.setEngine()` API or attempt to manipulate OpenSSL engines in a way that would exploit the CVE-2023-30586 vulnerability. The code includes checks for the experimental permission model and throws an error if it's enabled, preventing the use of custom OpenSSL engines in that scenario.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
