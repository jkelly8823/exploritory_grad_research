EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly involve certificate validation or handling of Subject Alternative Names (SANs). It focuses on parsing and processing information from a string, potentially related to certificate attributes. There is no indication of using Node.js's built-in TLS functionality or the `tls` module, which would be involved in certificate validation and potential vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-4
