EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet focuses on the destructor of an `Http2Session` class. It aims to ensure proper cleanup and resource release before the nghttp2 session is destroyed. The code iterates through active streams, detaches them, and clears the stream map. It then explicitly resets the `session_` pointer and verifies that the `current_nghttp2_memory_` is zero
