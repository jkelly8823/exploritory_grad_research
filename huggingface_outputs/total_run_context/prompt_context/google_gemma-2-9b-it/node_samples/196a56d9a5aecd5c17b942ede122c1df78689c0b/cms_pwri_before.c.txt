VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of OpenSSL's implementation of CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax). The vulnerable lines (10 and 11) involve generating a random initialization vector (IV) for a cryptographic cipher. 

The issue lies in the use of `RAND_bytes_ex` to generate the random IV. While `RAND_
