VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates potential vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows. Specifically, the lines defining `MAXCHUNK` and `MAXBITCHUNK` could lead to issues if not carefully handled. These constants determine the maximum size of data chunks processed by the code. If an attacker can manipulate input data to exceed these limits, it could result in a buffer overflow.
