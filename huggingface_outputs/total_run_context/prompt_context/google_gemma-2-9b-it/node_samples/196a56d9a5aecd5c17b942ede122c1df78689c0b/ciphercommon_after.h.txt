VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided defines constants related to OpenSSL's cryptographic operations. While it doesn't directly demonstrate a vulnerability, the use of `MAXCHUNK` and `MAXBITCHUNK` constants raises potential concerns. 
These constants define maximum chunk sizes for cryptographic operations. If an attacker can manipulate input data to exceed these limits, it could lead to buffer
