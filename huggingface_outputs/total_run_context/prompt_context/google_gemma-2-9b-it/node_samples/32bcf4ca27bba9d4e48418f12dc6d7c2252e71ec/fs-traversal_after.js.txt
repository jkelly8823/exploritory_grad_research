VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability similar to CVE-2023-39331.  The line `path.resolve = (s) => s;` overwrites the built-in `resolve` function from the `path` module. This allows an attacker to manipulate the resolution of file paths, potentially leading to path traversal attacks.
