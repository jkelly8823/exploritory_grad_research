VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `CRLF` to construct the status line of the HTTP response. This is vulnerable to CRLF injection because an attacker could send a malicious `reason` argument that includes additional CRLF sequences, effectively splitting the response and injecting arbitrary headers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input for the `reason` argument.
- Use a library that handles HTTP response construction
