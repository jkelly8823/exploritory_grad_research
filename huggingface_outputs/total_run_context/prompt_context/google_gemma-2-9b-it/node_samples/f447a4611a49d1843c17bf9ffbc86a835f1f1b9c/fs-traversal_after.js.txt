VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability related to path traversal using `Uint8Array` objects. Specifically, lines 10 and 11 construct a path using `new TextEncoder().encode(traversalPath)`, which creates a `Uint8Array` representation of the path. This `Uint8Array` can be used with Node.js file system functions, potentially
