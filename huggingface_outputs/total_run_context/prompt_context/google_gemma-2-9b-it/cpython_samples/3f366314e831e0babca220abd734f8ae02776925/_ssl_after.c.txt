VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `SSL_CTX_set_verify(self->ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL);`. This disables certificate verification, making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This vulnerability aligns with the description of CVE-2011-3389 (BEAST attack) which exploits weak SSL/TLS configurations.
