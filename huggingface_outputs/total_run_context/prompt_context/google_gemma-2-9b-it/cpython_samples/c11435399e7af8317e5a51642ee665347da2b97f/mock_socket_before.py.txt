VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to buffer overflow. The `readline()` method pops the first element from the `self.lines` list and appends a carriage return and newline character (`b'\r\n'`). 

If the `self.lines` list contains a large number of elements, the `readline()` method might attempt to read and process more data
