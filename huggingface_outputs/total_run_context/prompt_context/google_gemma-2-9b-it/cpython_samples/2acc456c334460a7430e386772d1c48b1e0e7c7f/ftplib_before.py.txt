VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential vulnerability related to insecure file handling. Specifically, lines 10-12 demonstrate the use of `self.file.readline()` to read data from a file. This approach lacks proper error handling and could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if the file is not accessible or encounters an error during reading.
