VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate any direct implementation of SSL/TLS functionality or the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. The code sets SSL options and defines a verification mode, but it does not perform the encryption or decryption operations that would be vulnerable to the BEAST attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
