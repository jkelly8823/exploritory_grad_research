VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not utilize the `utf-16` decoder in a way that would be susceptible to the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2135. The code examples demonstrate the use of `codecs.utf_16_le_decode` and `codecs.utf_16_be_decode` with error handling, which mitigates the
