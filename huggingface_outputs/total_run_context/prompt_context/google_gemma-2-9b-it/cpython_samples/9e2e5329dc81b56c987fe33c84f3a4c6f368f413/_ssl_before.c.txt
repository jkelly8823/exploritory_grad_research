VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `SSL_CTX_set_verify(self->ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL);` which disables certificate verification. This makes the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, as described in the CVE-2011-3389 description. An attacker could intercept and modify communication without being detected.
