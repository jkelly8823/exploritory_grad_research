VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code in line 7, `@view.render(:template => "../\\../test/abstract_unit.rb")`, demonstrates a directory traversal vulnerability. The use of `../` in the path allows an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure and potentially access sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in file paths.
- Validate file
