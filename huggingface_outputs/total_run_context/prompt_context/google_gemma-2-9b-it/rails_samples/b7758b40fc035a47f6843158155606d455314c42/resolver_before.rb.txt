VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `Dir[query]` which is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. An attacker could provide a `query` string containing ".." to access files outside the intended directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input for the `query` parameter.
- Use a whitelist approach to restrict allowed characters in the `query`.
- Implement a secure directory traversal
