VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code explicitly enables `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load = true`. This setting, when enabled, bypasses YAML's built-in security measures, making the application vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate data in the database, potentially injecting malicious YAML code that could be executed by the application.
