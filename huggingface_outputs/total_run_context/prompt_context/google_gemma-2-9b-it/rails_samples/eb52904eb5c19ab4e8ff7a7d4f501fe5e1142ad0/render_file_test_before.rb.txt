VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,6
EXPLANATION:
Both `relative_path` and `relative_path_with_dot` methods are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. The `render file:` method is used to render a file, and the provided file paths contain `..` which allows an attacker to navigate up the directory structure and potentially access sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in file
