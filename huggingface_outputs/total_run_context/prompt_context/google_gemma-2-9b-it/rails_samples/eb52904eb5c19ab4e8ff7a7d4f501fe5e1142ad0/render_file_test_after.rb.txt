VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,6
EXPLANATION:
Both `relative_path` and `relative_path_with_dot` methods are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. The `render file:` method in Ruby on Rails allows attackers to specify a file path. By using `..` (dot dot) in the path, an attacker can navigate up the directory structure and potentially access sensitive files.
