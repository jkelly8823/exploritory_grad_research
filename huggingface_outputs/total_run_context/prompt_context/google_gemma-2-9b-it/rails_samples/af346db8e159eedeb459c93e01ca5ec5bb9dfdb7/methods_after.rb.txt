VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes a regular expression `/[A-Z-]|::/` in the first line. This regex is susceptible to the CVE-2023-22796 vulnerability as it can be exploited through a specially crafted string to trigger catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
