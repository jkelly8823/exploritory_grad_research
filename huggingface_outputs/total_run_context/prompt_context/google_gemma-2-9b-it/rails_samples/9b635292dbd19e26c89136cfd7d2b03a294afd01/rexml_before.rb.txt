VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses REXML::Document.new(data) to parse an XML document. This is vulnerable to CVE-2015-3227 because it does not properly handle deep XML documents, which could lead to a denial of service (SystemStackError).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a patched version of Ruby on Rails or REXML.
- Sanitize
