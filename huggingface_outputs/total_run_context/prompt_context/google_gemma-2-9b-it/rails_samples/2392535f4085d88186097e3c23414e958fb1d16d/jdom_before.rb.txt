VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and `InputSource` classes, which are susceptible to XML external entity (XXE) attacks.  The `parse` method can process external entities if not properly configured, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Configure the `DocumentBuilderFactory` to disable external entity resolution.
