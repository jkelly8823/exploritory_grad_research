VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not utilize the `number_to_currency` helper method in a way that would be susceptible to the CVE-2013-6415 vulnerability. The vulnerability arises when user-supplied input is directly used within the `unit` parameter of the helper.  The example code does not demonstrate this.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
