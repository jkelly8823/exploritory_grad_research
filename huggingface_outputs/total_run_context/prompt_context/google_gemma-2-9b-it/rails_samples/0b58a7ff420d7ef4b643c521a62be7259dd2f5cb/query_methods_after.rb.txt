VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize the `limit` function in a way that would be susceptible to the CVE-2011-0448 vulnerability. The `connection.sanitize_limit(@limit_value)` call suggests that the framework is handling the sanitization of the limit value, mitigating the risk of SQL injection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
