EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet implements a custom HTML escaping function. However, the regular expression used for escaping is insufficient to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, the regex does not properly handle Unicode escape sequences, which can be used to bypass the escaping mechanism.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a dedicated HTML escaping library or function that is specifically designed to handle Unicode escape sequences
