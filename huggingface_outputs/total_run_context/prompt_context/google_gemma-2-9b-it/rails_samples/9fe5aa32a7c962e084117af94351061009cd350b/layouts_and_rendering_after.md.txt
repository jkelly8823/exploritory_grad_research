VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code `render template: "products/show"` is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `products/show` template path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. For example, they could provide a path like `../../etc/passwd` to read the system's password file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in template paths
