VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet `render template: "products/show"`  is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks if the `products/show` template path is constructed using user input. An attacker could manipulate the input to include `..` (dot dot) sequences, potentially allowing them to access files outside the intended directory structure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize all user input used to construct template paths
