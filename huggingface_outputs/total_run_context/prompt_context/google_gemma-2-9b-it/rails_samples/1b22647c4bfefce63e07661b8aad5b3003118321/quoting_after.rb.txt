EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet focuses on handling potential integer overflow issues when interacting with PostgreSQL. It implements a check to ensure that integer values provided to the database are within the range of a 64-bit signed integer. If a value exceeds this range, it raises an exception to prevent potential performance degradation or unexpected behavior due to PostgreSQL treating the column type as numeric.
