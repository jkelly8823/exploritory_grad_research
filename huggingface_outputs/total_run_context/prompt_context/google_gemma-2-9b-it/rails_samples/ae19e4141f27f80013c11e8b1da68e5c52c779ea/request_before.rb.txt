VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for `xhr?` which indicates an XMLHttpRequest request. However, it lacks proper validation of the `X-Requested-With` header, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. An attacker could manipulate this header to trick the application into performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement robust CSRF protection mechanisms, such as using CSRF tokens
