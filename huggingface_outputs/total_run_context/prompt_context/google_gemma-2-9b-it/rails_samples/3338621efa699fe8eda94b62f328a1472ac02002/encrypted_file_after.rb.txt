VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. This vulnerability stems from the use of `tmp_path.binwrite contents` without any bounds checking on the size of the `contents` variable. If `contents` is larger than the available buffer space, it could overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
