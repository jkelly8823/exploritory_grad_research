VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate any deserialization of untrusted data. It simply checks if a key contains the substring "latency" and introduces a 3-second sleep if it does. This is a simple performance optimization and does not involve any vulnerability related to deserialization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
