EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, the `deserialize_entry` method uses `Marshal.load` to deserialize serialized data. If this data originates from an untrusted source, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, when des
