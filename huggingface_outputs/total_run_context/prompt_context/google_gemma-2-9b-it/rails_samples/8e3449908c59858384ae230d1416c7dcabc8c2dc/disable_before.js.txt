VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential vulnerability related to variable shadowing. 
On line 10, the variable 'element' is reassigned within the `handleDisabledElement` function. This could lead to confusion and unexpected behavior if the original 'element' is intended to be used later in the function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Rename the reassigned variable
