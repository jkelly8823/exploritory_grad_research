EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a data attribute (`data-method`) to specify the HTTP method for a link. While this is a valid technique, it can be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if not properly handled.

An attacker could craft a malicious website that includes a link with the same `data-method` attribute, tricking a user into clicking it.
