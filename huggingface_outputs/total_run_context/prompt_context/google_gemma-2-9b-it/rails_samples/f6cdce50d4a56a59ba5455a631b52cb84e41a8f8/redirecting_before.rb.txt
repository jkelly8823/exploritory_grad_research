VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet implements a check for allowed hostnames in a URL. It compares the hostname extracted from the URL with the hostname of the current request. If the hostnames match or the URL starts with a slash (indicating a relative path), the function returns true, otherwise false. This check appears to address the open redirect vulnerability by ensuring that redirects only occur to trusted hosts.
