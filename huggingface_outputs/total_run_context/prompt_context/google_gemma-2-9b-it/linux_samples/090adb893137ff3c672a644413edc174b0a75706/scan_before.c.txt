VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any characteristics of a format string vulnerability as described in CVE-2013-2852. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of format string arguments, which is not evident in this code. The code uses `memcpy` for copying data between buffers, and there are no instances of user-supplied input being directly embedded into format strings.
