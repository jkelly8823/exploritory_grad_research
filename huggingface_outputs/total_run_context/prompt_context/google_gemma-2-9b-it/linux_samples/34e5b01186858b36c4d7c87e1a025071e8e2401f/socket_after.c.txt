VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit the race condition described in CVE-2021-23133. The code includes proper locking mechanisms using `spin_lock` and `spin_unlock` when manipulating the `auto_asconf_splist` list. This ensures that only one thread can access and modify the list at a time, preventing the race condition vulnerability.
