EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential infinite loop within the `for (;;)` loop. This loop lacks a clear exit condition, making it susceptible to running indefinitely if certain conditions are not met.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Introduce a proper exit condition within the `for (;;)` loop. This condition should evaluate to `false` when the loop should terminate.
