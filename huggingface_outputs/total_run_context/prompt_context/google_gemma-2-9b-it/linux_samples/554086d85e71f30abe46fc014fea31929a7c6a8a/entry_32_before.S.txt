VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit the vulnerabilities described in the CVE entries. The code implements a basic syscall handling mechanism, checking the syscall number against the total number of syscalls. If the number is valid, it calls the corresponding function from the `sys_call_table`. If the number is invalid, it sets the return code to `ENOSYS` (function not implemented).
