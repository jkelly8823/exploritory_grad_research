VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet exhibits a double free vulnerability. 
The line `kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer);` frees the memory pointed to by `rsi_dev->tx_buffer`. 
Subsequently, the line `kfree(rsi_dev);` attempts to free the memory pointed to by `rsi_dev`, which may have already been freed
