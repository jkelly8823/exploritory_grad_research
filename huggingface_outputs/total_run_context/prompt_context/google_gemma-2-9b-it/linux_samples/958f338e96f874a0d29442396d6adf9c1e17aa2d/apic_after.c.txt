VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None

The provided code snippet does not exhibit any of the vulnerabilities listed. The code focuses on identifying primary threads within a multi-core processor environment. It utilizes the `apic_id_is_primary_thread` function to determine if a given APIC ID belongs to a primary thread based on the number of siblings (SMT threads) associated with a core. There are no operations related to speculative execution
