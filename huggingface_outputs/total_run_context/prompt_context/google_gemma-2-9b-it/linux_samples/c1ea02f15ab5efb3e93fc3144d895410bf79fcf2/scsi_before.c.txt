EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop due to the `for (;;)` construct. This loop will continue indefinitely unless a `break` statement is encountered. The `break` statement is only triggered if `vhost_scsi_get_desc()` returns a non-zero value or -EIO. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario
