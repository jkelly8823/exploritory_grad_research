VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability on line 19. The variable `block` is assigned `NULL` initially and there's no guarantee that `sst_create_block()` will always return a non-null pointer. If `sst_create_block()` returns `NULL`, accessing `block->data` will lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
