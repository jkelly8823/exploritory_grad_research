VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 21,22
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. 
The variable `block` is initialized to NULL and then later used in the `sst_create_block` function call. If `bytes->block` is 0, then `sst_create_block` will be called with NULL, which could lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.
