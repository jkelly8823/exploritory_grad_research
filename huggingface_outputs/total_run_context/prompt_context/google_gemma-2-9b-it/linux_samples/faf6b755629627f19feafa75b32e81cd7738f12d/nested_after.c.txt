VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet directly manipulates the "int_ctl" field of the VMCB, which is the same field vulnerable in CVE-2021-3653. Improper validation of this field could allow a malicious L1 guest to enable AVIC support for a nested L2 guest, leading to potential guest-to-host escapes and other security issues.
