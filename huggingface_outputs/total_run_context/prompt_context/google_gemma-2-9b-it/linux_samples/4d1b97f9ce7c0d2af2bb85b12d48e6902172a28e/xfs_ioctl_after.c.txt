VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not utilize the XFS filesystem's IOCTLs (XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP, XFS_IOC_FREESP, etc.) that are vulnerable to the CVE-2021-4155 data leak flaw. The code only warns about the use of these deprecated IOCTLs and suggests using `fallocate` instead.
