VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not exhibit the characteristics of CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The conditional checks (`if (reply_data && msg->reply_size)`) ensure that the `reply_data` pointer and `msg->reply_size` are not NULL before proceeding with the `memcpy` operation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
