VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet implements fortified string functions using the `__builtin_object_size` and `__builtin_constant_p` functions to detect potential buffer overflows. The code explicitly checks the size of the destination buffer and the source string, ensuring that the copy operation does not exceed the buffer bounds.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code already implements robust buffer overflow protection.
