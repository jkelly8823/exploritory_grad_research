VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates proper resource management. The `strdup` function allocates memory for the `printk` string, and the `free` function is subsequently called to release this memory after it is no longer needed. This ensures that the allocated memory is deallocated, preventing a memory leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
