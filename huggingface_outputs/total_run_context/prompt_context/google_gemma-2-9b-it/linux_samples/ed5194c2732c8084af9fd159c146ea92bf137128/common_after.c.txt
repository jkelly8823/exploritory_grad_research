VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet you provided focuses on identifying and handling CPU vulnerabilities like Meltdown, Spectre, and MDS. It defines flags and checks for specific CPU features and capabilities to determine if mitigations are required. 

While the code addresses these vulnerabilities, it doesn't directly expose them. It aims to prevent exploitation by:

- Checking for the presence of required CPU mitigations (e.
