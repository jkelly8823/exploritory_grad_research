VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize the `gethostbyname` or `gethostbyname2` functions, which are implicated in the CVE-2015-0235 vulnerability (GHOST).  The code checks for a valid IP address using `inet_aton` and only falls back to `gethostbyname` if the IP address is invalid.
