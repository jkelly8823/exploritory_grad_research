VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize the `gethostbyname` function in a way that would be susceptible to the GHOST vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of hostname input within the `__nss_hostname_digits_dots` function in older versions of glibc. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
