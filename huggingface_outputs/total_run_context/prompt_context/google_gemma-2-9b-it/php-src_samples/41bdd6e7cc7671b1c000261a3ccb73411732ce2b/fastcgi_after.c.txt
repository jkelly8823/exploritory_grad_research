VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly utilize the `gethostbyname` or `gethostbyname2` functions in a way that would be vulnerable to the "GHOST" vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235). The code checks the length of the hostname against `MAXHOSTNAMELEN` before calling `gethostbyname`, which helps mitigate the risk
