VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability similar to CVE-2007-2872. The vulnerability arises in the calculation of `out_len` and its subsequent multiplication by `charsize`.

If `srclen`, `chunklen`, or `endlen` are manipulated to exceed certain bounds, the calculation of `out_len`
