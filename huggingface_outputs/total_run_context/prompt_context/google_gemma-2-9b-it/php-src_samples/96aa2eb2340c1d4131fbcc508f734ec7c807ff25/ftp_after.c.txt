VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate the use of SSL/TLS in a way that is vulnerable to the BEAST attack. The BEAST attack exploits vulnerabilities in the CBC mode of encryption used in older versions of SSL/TLS. 

While the code initializes an SSL context and creates SSL handles, it does not show any interaction with the client or any data transmission that would be susceptible to a
