VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a proper handling of the `magic_quotes_gpc` directive during the import of environment variables. It explicitly disables `magic_quotes_gpc` before importing the variables and re-enables it afterward. This mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks that could arise from improper handling of magic quotes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
