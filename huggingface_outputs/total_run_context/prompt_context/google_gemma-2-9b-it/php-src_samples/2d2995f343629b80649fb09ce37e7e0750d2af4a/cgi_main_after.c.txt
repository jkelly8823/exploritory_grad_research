VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a mechanism to temporarily disable magic_quotes_gpc while importing environment variables. This is a security measure to prevent potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code explicitly sets magic_quotes_gpc to "0" before importing the environment variables and then restores it to "1" afterward. This approach mitigates the risk associated with CVE-2012-08
