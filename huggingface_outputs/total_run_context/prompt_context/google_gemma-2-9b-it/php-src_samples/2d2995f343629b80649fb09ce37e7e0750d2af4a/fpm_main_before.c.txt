VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a mechanism to disable magic_quotes_gpc temporarily while importing environment variables. This is a security measure to prevent potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code explicitly sets magic_quotes_gpc to 0 before importing environment variables and restores it afterwards. This mitigates the risk associated with CVE-2012-0831.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
