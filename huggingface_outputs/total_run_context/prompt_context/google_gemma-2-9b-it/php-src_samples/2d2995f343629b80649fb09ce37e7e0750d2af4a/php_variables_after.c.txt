VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates the correct handling of the `magic_quotes_gpc` directive during the import of environment variables. It temporarily disables `magic_quotes_gpc` to prevent potential issues with escaping, and then re-enables it afterwards. This mitigates the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0831.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
