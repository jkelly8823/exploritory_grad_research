VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any direct implementation of cryptographic algorithms or functions. It only shows a module named "hmac" which likely encapsulates the HMAC implementation. Without access to the internal workings of the "hmac" module, it's impossible to determine if it correctly implements the HMAC algorithm and avoids the CWE-325 vulnerability.
