VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code exhibits a potential vulnerability related to unbounded memory allocation. The `connection()` function allocates memory using `malloc(1024)` without any input validation or size limits. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input to `malloc()` to request an excessively large amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or even a memory corruption vulnerability
