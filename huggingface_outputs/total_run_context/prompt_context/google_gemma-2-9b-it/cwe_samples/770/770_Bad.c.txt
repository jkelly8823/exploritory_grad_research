VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to resource exhaustion (CWE-770). The `while (1)` loop continuously accepts new connections using `accept(sock, ...)`.  Without any checks or limits on the number of connections accepted, a malicious actor could potentially flood the server with connections, exhausting available system resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory) and causing a
