EXPLANATION:
The code does not limit the number of connections that can be accepted by the server. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if an attacker opens a large number of connections, exhausting the server's resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Limit the number of connections that can be accepted by the server using a fixed thread pool size or a connection queue.
