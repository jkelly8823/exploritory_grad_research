VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to unbounded buffer allocation. The `getNextMessage` function is called repeatedly within a loop, reading data from the socket into the `buffer` array. However, the size of the `buffer` is fixed (`BUFFER_SIZE`). If the incoming data exceeds this size, it could lead to a buffer overflow.
