VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8,9
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value of the `StreamReader.Read()` method. If the file does not contain 1024 bytes, `Read()` will return a value less than 1024. The code will continue to process the `byteArray` as if it contained 1024 bytes, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other issues.
