VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../'` check only looks for the specific sequence `../` at the beginning of the username. An attacker could provide a username that includes other path traversal sequences, such as `../../` or `./`, which would allow them to access files outside the intended directory.
