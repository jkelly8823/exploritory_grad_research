VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strcpy` function copies data from `srcBuf` to `&destBuf[idx]`.  If `srcBuf` is longer than the remaining space in `destBuf` starting at `idx`, it will write beyond the allocated buffer bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.
