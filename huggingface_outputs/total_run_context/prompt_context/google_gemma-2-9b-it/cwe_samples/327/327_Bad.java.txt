VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm. DES is considered insecure due to its small key size (56 bits) which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Modern cryptographic standards recommend using algorithms with significantly larger key sizes, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace the DES algorithm with a more secure alternative like AES.
- Ensure
