VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-9
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the DES algorithm in ECB mode for encryption. DES is a weak encryption algorithm that is easily breakable with modern computing power. ECB mode is also vulnerable to various attacks, such as the known-plaintext attack. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a stronger encryption algorithm, such as AES-256, in a secure mode like CBC or GCM.
