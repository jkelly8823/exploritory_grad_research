VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `EVP_des_ecb()`, which implements the DES algorithm in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  DES is considered outdated and insecure due to its relatively short key size (56 bits), making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.  Furthermore, using ECB mode is highly vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, as it encrypts identical plaintext blocks
