VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The `getPatients` method returns a reference to the `patientList` array directly. This means that any changes made to `patientList` by the calling function will directly modify the original array within the `ClinicalTrial` object. This violates the principle of immutability and can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Create a copy of the `patientList`
