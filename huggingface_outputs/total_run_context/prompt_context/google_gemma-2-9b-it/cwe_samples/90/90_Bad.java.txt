VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code directly incorporates the user-supplied `address` variable into the LDAP search filter without any sanitization or escaping. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could craft malicious input in the `address` variable to manipulate the LDAP query. For example, an attacker could inject arbitrary attributes or commands into the filter, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or other security breaches.
