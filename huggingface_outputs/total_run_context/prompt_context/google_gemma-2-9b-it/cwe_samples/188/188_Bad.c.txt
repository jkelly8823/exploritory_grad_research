VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.  The line `*(&a + 1) = 0;` attempts to write a null terminator (`0`) to the memory location one byte past the end of the `a` variable.  Since `a` is a single character, this write operation overwrites adjacent memory, potentially corrupting other data or even leading to
