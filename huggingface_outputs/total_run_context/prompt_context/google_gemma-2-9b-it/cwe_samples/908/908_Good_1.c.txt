EXPLANATION:
The variable `test_string` is declared but not initialized before it is used. This means its value is undefined, leading to potential issues like reading garbage data or unexpected program behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize `test_string` to a default value (e.g., NULL) before the `if` statement.

```c
char *test_string = NULL; //
