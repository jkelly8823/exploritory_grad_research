VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. The `$Username` variable is taken from untrusted input (`GetUntrustedInput()`) and used to construct a file path. While the code attempts to sanitize the input by removing `..` sequences, this is insufficient. An attacker could craft input that bypasses this sanitization, leading to access of files outside the intended directory
