VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not directly construct a pathname using external input. The filename is taken as a command-line argument (`sys.argv[1]`), but it is not used to dynamically build a path that could potentially lead to a directory traversal vulnerability. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
