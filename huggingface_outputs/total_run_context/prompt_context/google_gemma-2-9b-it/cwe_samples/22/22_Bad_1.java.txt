VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code takes user input for the `path` variable without proper sanitization.  An attacker could provide a path like "/safe_dir/../../etc/passwd" which would resolve to a file outside the intended "safe_dir" directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Sanitize the user input to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences like ".." that can be used for directory traversal.
