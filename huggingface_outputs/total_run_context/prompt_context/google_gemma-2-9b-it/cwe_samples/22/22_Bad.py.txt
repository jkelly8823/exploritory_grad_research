VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not demonstrate the vulnerability described in CWE_22. The code constructs a file path using `os.path.join()` which is a safe way to join path components. It does not directly use external input to construct the path, and it does not appear to be susceptible to path traversal attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
