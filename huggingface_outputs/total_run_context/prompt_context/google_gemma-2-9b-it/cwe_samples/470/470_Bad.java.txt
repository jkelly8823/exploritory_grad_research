VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the `Class.forName(ctl + "Command")` line.  An attacker can provide a malicious string as the `ctl` parameter, leading to the loading and execution of arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize user input:** Validate and sanitize the `ctl` parameter to ensure it only contains allowed values
