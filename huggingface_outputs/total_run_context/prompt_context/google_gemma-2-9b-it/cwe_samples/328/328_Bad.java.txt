VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code uses SHA, which is a cryptographic hash function. However, the code does not specify the SHA variant (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512). Using a weaker SHA variant like SHA-1 is vulnerable to preimage, second preimage, and birthday attacks, as described in the CWE description.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a stronger SHA
