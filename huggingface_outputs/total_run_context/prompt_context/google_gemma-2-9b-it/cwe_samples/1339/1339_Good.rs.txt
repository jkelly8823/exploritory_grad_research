EXPLANATION:
The code uses `BigRational` which is designed to handle arbitrary precision rational numbers. However, the use of `from_float` to initialize `BigRational` values introduces potential for precision loss. Floating-point numbers have a limited precision, and converting them to `BigRational` might not preserve all the decimal places, leading to inaccuracies
