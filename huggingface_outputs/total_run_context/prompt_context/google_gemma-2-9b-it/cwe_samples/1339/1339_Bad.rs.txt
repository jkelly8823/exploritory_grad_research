EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates potential for floating-point precision issues due to repeated calculations involving division and subtraction of floating-point numbers. 

Specifically:

- Line 2: The expression `(815.0 - 1500.0 / z) / y` involves division, which can lead to rounding errors when dealing with floating-
