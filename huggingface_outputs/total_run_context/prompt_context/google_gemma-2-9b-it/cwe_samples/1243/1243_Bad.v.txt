EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a vulnerability related to insecure access to security-sensitive information during debug mode. 

The code assigns values to variables `key_big0`, `key_big1`, and `key_big2` based on the value of `debug_mode_i` and `key_sel`.  

While the code conditionally assigns different values depending on `
