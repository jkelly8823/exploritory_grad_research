EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the SSL certificate's validity but lacks a crucial step: verifying the certificate chain against a trusted root certificate store.  The `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` function returns an error code indicating the result of the certificate verification. However, it doesn't explicitly check if the certificate chain is valid or if the certificate is signed by a trusted authority.
