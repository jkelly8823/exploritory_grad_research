VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability related to improper error handling. Specifically, it fails to check if the `malloc()` function call successfully allocated memory. 

The `malloc()` function returns a pointer to the allocated memory block if successful. If memory allocation fails, it returns `NULL`. In the provided code, the condition `tmp < 0` is used to check for an error.
