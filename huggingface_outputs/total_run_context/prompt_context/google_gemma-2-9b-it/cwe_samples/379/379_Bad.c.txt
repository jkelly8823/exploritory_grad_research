EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `tmpfile()` to create a temporary file. While `tmpfile()` is designed to create files in a system-specific temporary directory, it does not inherently guarantee that the directory itself has restrictive permissions. An attacker could potentially gain access to the temporary directory and, consequently, the created temporary file if the directory's permissions are not adequately configured.
