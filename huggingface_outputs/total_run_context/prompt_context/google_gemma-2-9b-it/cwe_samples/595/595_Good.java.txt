VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the `equals()` method of the `BankAccount` object for comparison. If the `BankAccount` class only compares object references and not the actual account data (e.g., account number, balance), this would lead to a vulnerability as described by CWE_595. Two BankAccount objects with identical data but different references would be considered unequal.
