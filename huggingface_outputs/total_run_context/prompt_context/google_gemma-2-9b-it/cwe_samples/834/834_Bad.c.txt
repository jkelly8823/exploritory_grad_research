VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a recursive function `do_something_recursive` that lacks a proper base case. The function calls itself with the same value of `flg` in each iteration. Since `flg` is always true, the recursion continues indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Modify the function to include a base case that terminates the recursion when a certain condition is met
