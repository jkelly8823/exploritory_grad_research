VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The provided code demonstrates a potential infinite recursion vulnerability. The `do_something_recursive` function calls itself recursively without a clear termination condition. The `flg` variable is modified within the function, but it's not guaranteed to change its value in a way that will eventually lead to the recursion stopping. If `flg` remains true indefinitely, the function will call itself repeatedly, leading to
