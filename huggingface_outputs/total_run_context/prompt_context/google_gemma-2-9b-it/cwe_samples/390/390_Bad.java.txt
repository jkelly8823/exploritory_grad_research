VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code catches `Exception` but does not handle it appropriately. This is a potential vulnerability as it could lead to unexpected behavior or data loss if an error occurs during file reading.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Log the exception and its details for debugging purposes.
- Consider re-throwing the exception after logging, allowing higher-level code to handle it.
- Implement error handling strategies
