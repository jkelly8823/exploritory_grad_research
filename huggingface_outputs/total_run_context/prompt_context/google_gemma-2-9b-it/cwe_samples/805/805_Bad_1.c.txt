VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from `srcBuf` to `destBuf` based on the size returned by `returnChunkSize(destBuf)`.  The issue lies in the subtraction of 1 from the returned chunk size before the copy operation. If `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns a value that is not
