VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strncpy` function is used to copy data from the `source` buffer to the `dest` buffer. However, the length argument passed to `strncpy` is `sizeof(dest)-1`, which is 11. This means that `strncpy` will copy at most 11 characters from the `source` buffer to the
