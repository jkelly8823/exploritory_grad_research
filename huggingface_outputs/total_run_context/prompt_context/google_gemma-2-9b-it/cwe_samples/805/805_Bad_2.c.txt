EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided uses `strncpy` which is designed to prevent buffer overflows.  `strncpy` takes a maximum length as the third argument, ensuring that it only copies up to that many characters from the source string. In this case, `sizeof(source)-1` is passed as the maximum length, which is 20 (the size of the source array minus 1 for the
