EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not exhibit the characteristics of CWE-705 (Improper Resource Management).  The code checks for authorization and redirects to an error page if unauthorized.  The `http_redirect` function likely handles the redirection properly, ensuring control flow returns to the intended location. The subsequent `echo $status;` statement suggests the code continues execution after the redirection check.
