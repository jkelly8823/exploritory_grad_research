VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code uses an IP address for authentication, which is a known vulnerability (CWE-291).  An attacker could potentially spoof their IP address to gain unauthorized access. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a more robust authentication mechanism, such as using a unique identifier for each user or a cryptographic hash function.
- Avoid using IP addresses directly for authentication purposes.
