VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `inet_ntoa(cli.sin_addr)` to compare the client's IP address with `getTrustedAddress()`. This directly uses an IP address for authentication, which is a known vulnerability (CWE-291). 

IP addresses are not suitable for authentication as they can be spoofed and are not inherently unique identifiers.
