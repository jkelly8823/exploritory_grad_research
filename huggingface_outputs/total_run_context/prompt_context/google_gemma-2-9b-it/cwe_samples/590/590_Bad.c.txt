VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free the memory pointed to by `bar`. However, `bar` is an array declared on the stack, not allocated on the heap using functions like `malloc()`. Attempting to free stack memory can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- If the intention is to dynamically allocate memory for the `bar` array, use `malloc()` instead
