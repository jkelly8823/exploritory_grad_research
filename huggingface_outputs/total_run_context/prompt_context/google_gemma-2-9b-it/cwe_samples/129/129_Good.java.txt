VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code explicitly checks if the provided index is within the valid range of the `products` array. It uses the `MAX_PRODUCTS` constant to define the upper bound of the valid index range. If the index is out of bounds, an error message is printed, and an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown. This validation prevents the code from accessing elements beyond the array's bounds, mitigating
