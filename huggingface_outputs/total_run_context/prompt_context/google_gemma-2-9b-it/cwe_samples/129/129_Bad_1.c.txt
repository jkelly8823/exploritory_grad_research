VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `sscanf(buf, "%d %d", &num, &size)` to parse the received data. If the input `buf` contains malicious data, an attacker could craft input to cause `num` to be out of bounds for the `sizes` array. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
