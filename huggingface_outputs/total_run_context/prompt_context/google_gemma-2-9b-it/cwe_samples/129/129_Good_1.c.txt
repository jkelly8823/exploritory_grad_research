VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the potential for `num` to exceed the bounds of the `sizes` array. The condition `num > 0 && num <= (unsigned)count` does not guarantee that `num` will be within the valid index range of the `sizes` array. If `count` is smaller than the maximum value of `
