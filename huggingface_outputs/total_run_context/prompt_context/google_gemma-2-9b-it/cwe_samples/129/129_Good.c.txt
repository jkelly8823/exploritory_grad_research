VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a check for array bounds before accessing the array element. The condition `if (index >= 0 && index < len)` ensures that the `index` variable is within the valid range of the array. This mitigates the risk of an out-of-bounds array access vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
