EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from `srcBuf` to `destBuf` based on the size returned by `returnChunkSize(destBuf)`.  The issue arises because `returnChunkSize(destBuf) - 1` is used as the copy size. If `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns a
