VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. In the loop iterating through `msg->msgBody`, the index `index` is used to access elements in the `message` array. However, there's no check to ensure that `index` does not exceed the bounds of the `message` array (which has a fixed size of `MESSAGE_SIZE`). If `
