VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The `strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name)` line is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `hostname` buffer is fixed at 64 characters, but the `hp->h_name` string could potentially be longer. If `hp->h_name` is longer than 64 characters, `strcpy` will write past the end of the `hostname`
