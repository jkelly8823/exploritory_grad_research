VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the `==` operator to compare an integer (`$i`) with a string (`$s1`). In PHP, `==` performs type juggling, meaning it will attempt to convert the operands to a common type before comparison. In this case, the string `$s1` will be converted to an integer, leading to a potential vulnerability.
