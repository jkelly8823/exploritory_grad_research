Specifically, the `getProcessOwner(processID)` function is assumed to accurately determine the owner of the process. However, there's no explicit check or validation to ensure that the returned owner information is trustworthy or comes from a reliable source. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `getProcessOwner` function to return a false
