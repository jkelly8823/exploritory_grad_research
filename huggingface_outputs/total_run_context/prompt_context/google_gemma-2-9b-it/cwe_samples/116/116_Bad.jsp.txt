VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly outputs user-supplied data (`request.getParameter("email")`) without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the "email" parameter, which would then be executed in the browser of any user who views the page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the user input
