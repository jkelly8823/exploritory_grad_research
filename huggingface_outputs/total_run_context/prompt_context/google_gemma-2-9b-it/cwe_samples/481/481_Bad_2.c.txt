VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The line `if (foo=1)` contains the vulnerability CWE_ID: 481. The code uses the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`. This means that the value of `foo` is being assigned the value 1, rather than being compared to 1. As a result, the condition in the `if` statement will always be true
