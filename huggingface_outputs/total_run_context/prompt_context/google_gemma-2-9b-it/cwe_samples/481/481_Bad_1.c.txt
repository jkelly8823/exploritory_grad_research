VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The line `if (str[i] = ':')` contains a vulnerability. The single equals sign (`=`) is an assignment operator, not a comparison operator. This means that the code is assigning the value `':'` to `str[i]` instead of comparing it. This will likely lead to unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line to use
