EXPLANATION:
The code sets the effective user ID to 0 (root) using `seteuid(0)`. This grants the process root privileges, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system. Even though `seteuid(getuid())` is called afterwards, it's too late. The damage is already done. The process has already executed with root privileges.
