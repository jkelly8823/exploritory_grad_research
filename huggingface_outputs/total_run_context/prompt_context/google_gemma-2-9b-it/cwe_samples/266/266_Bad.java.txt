VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-7
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to privilege escalation. The `AccessController.doPrivileged()` method allows code to execute with elevated privileges. In this case, the code loads a native library (`System.loadLibrary("awt");`).  

If the native library contains malicious code, an attacker could potentially exploit this to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.
