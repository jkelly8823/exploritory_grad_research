VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does initialize the `test_string` variable with a value before it is used. While the value of `test_string` is changed later in the code, this does not constitute a vulnerability as the variable is always assigned a value. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
