EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet utilizes a regular expression (`/^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i`) that exhibits potential for inefficient computation. The use of lookarounds (`(?=...)`) and backreferences (`\2`) within the pattern can lead to exponential complexity in certain scenarios. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Simplify the Regular Expression:**  Analyze the intended functionality
