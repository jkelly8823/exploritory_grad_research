VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to password storage and authentication. 

Specifically, the use of a hardcoded password hash (`secret_password()`) raises concerns.  Storing passwords in plain text or using weak hashing algorithms is a major security risk. An attacker who gains access to the code or the system where it runs could potentially retrieve the hardcoded hash and attempt to crack it
