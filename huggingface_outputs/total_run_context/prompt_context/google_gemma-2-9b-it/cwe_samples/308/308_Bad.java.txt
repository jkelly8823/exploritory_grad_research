VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a simple password hashing method that is vulnerable to various attacks. 

Specifically, the use of `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA")` without specifying a salt and a strong hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or bcrypt makes the password hashes easily crackable. 

Attackers can use pre-computed rainbow tables or brute-force attacks to compromise the stored passwords.
