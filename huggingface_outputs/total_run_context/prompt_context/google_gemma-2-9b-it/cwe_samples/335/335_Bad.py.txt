EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `os.urandom(2)` to obtain a random seed of 2 bytes. This is a good practice as it leverages the operating system's cryptographically secure random number generator.  The seed is then used to initialize the `random` module's PRNG.  While the seed length could be considered small, it's sufficient for most general
