VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `srand(time())` to seed the random number generator. While this seems like a good practice, it's not secure. The `time()` function returns the current time in seconds since the epoch. If an attacker can predict or manipulate the time, they can predict the random numbers generated by the PRNG. This is a classic vulnerability known as a "weak random
