VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `System.currentTimeMillis()` as the seed for the `Random` object. While this provides a seemingly unique seed, it is not cryptographically secure.  An attacker with knowledge of the system's timing could potentially predict the seed and therefore generate the same sequence of "random" numbers. This can lead to predictable outcomes in scenarios like account generation or security challenges.
