VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code does not initialize the variables `m`, `n`, and `error` before using them. This is a potential vulnerability because the values of these variables are undefined and could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. For example, if `untrusted_input` does not contain valid integer values, `sscanf` will return an error code, but the code does not handle this case
