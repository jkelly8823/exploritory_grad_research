VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hardcoded password ("Mew!") for administrative access. This is a major security vulnerability as it allows anyone who knows the password to gain administrative privileges. There is no mechanism for changing or configuring the password, making it impossible for administrators to tailor security settings to their environment.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt)
