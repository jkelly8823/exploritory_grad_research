VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code directly adds untrusted user input (`untrustedRawInputData`) to an HTTP header (`HEADER_NAME`) without any sanitization or neutralization of potential web scripting syntax. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or other code into the header, which could be executed by vulnerable web browser components like Flash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the `untrustedRawInputData
