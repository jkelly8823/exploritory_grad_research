VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits the vulnerability CWE-584 (Improper Resource Handling).  The `finally` block contains a `return` statement. This means that if an exception is thrown within the `try` block, the `finally` block will still execute, returning the value `r`. This effectively hides the exception, preventing it from being handled appropriately.
