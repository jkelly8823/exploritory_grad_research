VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any characteristics of a race condition vulnerability (CWE-1298). 

Race conditions typically arise when multiple threads or processes access and modify shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable behavior. The code you've provided appears to be sequential in nature, with most operations being controlled by the `clk_i` clock signal and the `rst_ni`
