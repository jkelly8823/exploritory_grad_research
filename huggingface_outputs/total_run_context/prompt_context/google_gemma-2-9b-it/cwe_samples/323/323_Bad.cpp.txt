VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-10
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a nonce that is generated and then reused in the password hashing process. This is a vulnerability because the nonce is not unique to the current request. An attacker could potentially replay a previous nonce and gain unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Store the nonce securely and associate it with the request.
- Verify that
