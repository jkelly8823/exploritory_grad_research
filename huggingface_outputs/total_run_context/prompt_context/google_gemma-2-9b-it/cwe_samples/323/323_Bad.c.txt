VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hardcoded nonce "bad" which is reused for every encryption operation. This violates the principle of using unique nonces for each encryption, making the encryption vulnerable to attacks like replay attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Generate a unique random nonce for each encryption operation.
- Store the nonce along with the encrypted data for verification purposes.
- Use a cryptographically secure
