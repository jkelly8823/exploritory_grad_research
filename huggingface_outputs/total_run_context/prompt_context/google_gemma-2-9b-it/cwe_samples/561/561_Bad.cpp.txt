VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a block of code that will never be executed. The `if (b)` condition is never met, so the line `s = "Yes";` will never be executed. This means that the `if (s != null)` condition will always be false, and the `Dead()` function will never be called. This is a classic example of dead code.
