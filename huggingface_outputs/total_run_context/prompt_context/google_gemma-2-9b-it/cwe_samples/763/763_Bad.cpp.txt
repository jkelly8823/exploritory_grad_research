EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free a dynamically allocated object using the `free()` function. However, `free()` is intended for memory allocated using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`.  Since `BarObj` was allocated using `new`, it should be deallocated using `delete`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change `free(ptr);` to `delete ptr;`.
