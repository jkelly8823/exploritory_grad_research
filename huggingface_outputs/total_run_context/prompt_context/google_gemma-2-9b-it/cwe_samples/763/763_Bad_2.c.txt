VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to memory management. Specifically, the `free(tok)` statement within the `if( isMalformed( tok ) )` block might be problematic. 

While the intention is to free memory allocated for a malformed token, the `tok` pointer itself might not point to the memory originally allocated by `malloc`.
