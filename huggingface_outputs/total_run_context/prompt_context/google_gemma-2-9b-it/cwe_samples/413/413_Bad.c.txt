EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates proper usage of a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`) for protecting a shared resource. 

It acquires the mutex lock using `pthread_mutex_lock(mutex)` before accessing the shared resource and releases the lock using `pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)` after the access is complete. This ensures exclusive access to the resource, preventing race conditions and data corruption
