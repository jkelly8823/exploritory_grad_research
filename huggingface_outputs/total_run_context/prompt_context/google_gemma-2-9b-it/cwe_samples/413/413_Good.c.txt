EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates proper usage of a mutex for protecting shared resources. It acquires the mutex using `pthread_mutex_lock()` and checks for errors. If successful, it proceeds to access the shared resource. Finally, it releases the mutex using `pthread_mutex_unlock()`. This ensures exclusive access to the resource while the critical section is being executed.
