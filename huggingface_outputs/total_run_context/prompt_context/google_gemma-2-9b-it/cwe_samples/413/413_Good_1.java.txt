VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates proper use of a `ReentrantLock` and a `Condition` object to ensure thread safety. 

The `balanceChangeLock` is acquired before any modification to the account balance, preventing race conditions. The `sufficientFundsCondition` is used to signal and wait for sufficient funds, allowing threads to temporarily release the lock and avoid unnecessary blocking.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
