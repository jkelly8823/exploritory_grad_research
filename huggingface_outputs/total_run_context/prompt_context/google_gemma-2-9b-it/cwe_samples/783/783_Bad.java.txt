EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a vulnerability related to operator precedence. The expression `currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment`  is susceptible to incorrect calculation due to the order of operations. 

The division operation (`/`) is performed before the subtraction operation (`-`). This means that `initialInvestment / initialInvestment` will always result in 1. Consequently, the calculation becomes `currentValue -
