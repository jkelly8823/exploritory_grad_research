VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly embeds user-supplied input (`request.getParameter("eid")`) into the HTML output without any sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the `eid` parameter to inject malicious JavaScript code, which would then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize
