VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly echoes user input from the $_GET['username'] parameter without any sanitization or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the username parameter, which would then be executed in the browser of any user who visits the page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in output.
