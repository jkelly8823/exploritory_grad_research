VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-94 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) because it directly uses user input in the `split()` method without proper sanitization. An attacker could provide malicious input containing special characters that could be interpreted as code by the `split()` method, potentially leading to code injection vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input
