EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to code injection via the `handleConfigAction` function. 

The `$action` and `$key` parameters are directly used to construct a string that is then evaluated using `eval()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating the `action` and `key` parameters. For example, an attacker could send a request with `action
