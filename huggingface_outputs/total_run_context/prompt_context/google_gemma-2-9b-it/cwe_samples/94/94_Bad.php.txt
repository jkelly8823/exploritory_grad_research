VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Code Injection via the `include()` function. The `$MessageFile` variable is directly used in the `include()` function without any sanitization or validation of the input received from the `$_GET["action"]` parameter. An attacker could manipulate the `action` parameter to include a malicious file, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.
