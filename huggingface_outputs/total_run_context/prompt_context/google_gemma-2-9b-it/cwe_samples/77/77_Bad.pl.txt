VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection because it directly embeds the user-supplied `$arg` into the `$cmd` string without proper sanitization. An attacker could provide a filename containing malicious commands, which would be executed by the `system()` function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer alternative to `system()`, such as `exec()` or `open()`,
