VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a vulnerability related to improper input validation (CWE-20). 

The code retrieves the `quantity` attribute from a `currentUser` object. While it's important to validate user input in general, this code snippet doesn't directly receive user input. The `quantity` is assumed to be already validated and stored within the `currentUser` object.
