VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not validate the `untrustedListSize` input. An attacker could supply a very large value, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack by consuming excessive memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Enforce a maximum limit on the allowed list size.
- Use a bounded integer type (e.g., `int` with a defined range) to restrict the input
