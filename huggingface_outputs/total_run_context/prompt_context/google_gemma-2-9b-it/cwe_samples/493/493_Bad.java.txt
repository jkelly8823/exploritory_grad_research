VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None

The code snippet you provided declares the `price` variable as `public final`. The `final` keyword in Java prevents the variable from being modified after its initial assignment. Since the `price` variable is initialized within the constructor, it cannot be changed externally. Therefore, the vulnerability CWE_493 (Publicly accessible mutable variable) is not present in this code.
