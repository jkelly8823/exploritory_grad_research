VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The variable `configPath` is declared as a public string and is not marked as `final`. This means that its value can be modified from outside the class, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Declare the variable as `final` to prevent its value from being changed after initialization.
- Consider using a private variable and providing public getter and setter methods
