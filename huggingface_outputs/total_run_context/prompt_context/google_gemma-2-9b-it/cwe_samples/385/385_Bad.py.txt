VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential covert timing channel vulnerability. The loop iterates through the length of the password, comparing characters at each position. The time taken to iterate through the loop and compare characters could vary depending on the password's content. An attacker could potentially infer information about the password by observing the execution time of the `validate_password` function.
