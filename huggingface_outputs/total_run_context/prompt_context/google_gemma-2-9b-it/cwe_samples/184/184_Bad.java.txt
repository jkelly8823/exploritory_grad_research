VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a regular expression to replace all occurrences of the word "script" with a mask. This is vulnerable to CWE-184 because it does not account for all possible ways to inject malicious script tags. For example, an attacker could use different tags like "<script>", "</script>", or even encode the script tag in a way that the regular expression does not match.
