VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The `getColors()` method is declared as `public`, meaning it can be accessed from outside the class. However, it returns a reference to the private `colors` array. This allows external code to directly modify the `colors` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Return a copy of the `colors` array instead of a reference.
