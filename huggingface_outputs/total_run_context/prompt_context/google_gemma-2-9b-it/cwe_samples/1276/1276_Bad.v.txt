VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to data security levels. The `data_in_security_level` input to the `tz_peripheral` module is hardcoded to `1'b0`, effectively setting all data as "secure" regardless of its actual security classification. This could lead to unintended disclosure of sensitive information or bypass of security mechanisms.
