VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-10
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet exhibits the vulnerability CWE-484 (Missing Break Statement in Switch).  The `switch` statement lacks `break` statements after each case. Consequently, the code execution falls through to subsequent cases, resulting in all months being printed instead of just the one corresponding to the input `month`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add `break` statements after each case
