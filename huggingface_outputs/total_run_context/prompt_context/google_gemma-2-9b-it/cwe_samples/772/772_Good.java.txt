VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code does not explicitly close the `FileReader` object, which is wrapped by the `BufferedReader`. This can lead to a resource leak, as the file handle will remain open even after the `processFile` method completes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Wrap the `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` objects in a `using` statement to ensure they are automatically closed when they are no longer needed
