VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code catches any Throwable and logs the error but returns without providing a meaningful status code or return value. This violates CWE-392 as it doesn't inform the caller about the error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of returning, throw a custom exception that provides more context about the error.
- Return a specific error code to indicate the type of error encountered.
-
