VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double free vulnerability. When a character is found, the `free(str)` statement is executed. However, the loop continues to increment the `str` pointer, eventually leading to a situation where `str` points to a memory location that has already been freed. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
