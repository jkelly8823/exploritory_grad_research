VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11,16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double free vulnerability. When a character is found, the `free(str)` statement is executed. However, if the character is not found, `free(str)` is executed again. This leads to a double free, which can cause memory corruption and program crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the second `free(str)`
