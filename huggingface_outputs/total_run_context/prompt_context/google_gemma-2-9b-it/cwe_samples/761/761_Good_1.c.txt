VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow because `free(input)` is called, but the pointer `input` does not point to the start of the allocated buffer.  The `strtok` function modifies the input buffer in-place, potentially overwriting memory beyond the allocated space. When `free(input)` is called, it attempts to deallocate the memory pointed to
