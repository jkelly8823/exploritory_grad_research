VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-621: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer because it uses `extract($_POST)` without proper validation of the keys. This means that an attacker could provide malicious input in the $_POST array, potentially using variable names that overwrite sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize and validate all user input before
