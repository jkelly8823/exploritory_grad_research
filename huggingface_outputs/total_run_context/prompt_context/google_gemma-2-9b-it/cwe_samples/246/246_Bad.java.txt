VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code directly creates a `Socket` object, which is a low-level network connection. This is a potential vulnerability because it bypasses the security mechanisms and abstractions provided by the J2EE framework.  The framework typically handles socket creation and management in a secure way, ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and connection handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use J2EE
