VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-12
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet implements a finite state machine (FSM) using a case statement. The FSM appears to have a potential vulnerability related to the handling of unexpected or invalid user input. 

The `default` case assigns the state to `2'h0`. However, it's unclear if this state is a valid or intended state for the FSM. If `2
