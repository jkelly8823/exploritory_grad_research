VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `strncat` function is used to concatenate strings, but the buffer size is not properly checked. If the `firstname` or `lastname` strings are longer than `sizeof(fullname)-strlen(fullname)-1`, a buffer overflow will occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer string concatenation function, such as `snprintf`.
