VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function in line 2 has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The format string `"%16s.dat"` specifies a fixed-size buffer of 16 characters for the `filename` argument. If the input `filename` is longer than 16 characters, the extra characters will overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a security breach
