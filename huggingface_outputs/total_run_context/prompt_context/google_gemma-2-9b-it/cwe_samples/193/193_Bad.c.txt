VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-193 (Integer Overflow or Underflow) because it does not properly validate the `numWidgets` value before allocating memory. 

If `GetUntrustedSizeValue()` returns a value larger than `MAX_NUM_WIDGETS`, the code will allocate more memory than intended, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
