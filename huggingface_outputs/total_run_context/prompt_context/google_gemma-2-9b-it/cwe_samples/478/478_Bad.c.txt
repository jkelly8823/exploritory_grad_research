VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
While the code lacks a default case, the `exit(-1)` statement within the `FAILED` case will terminate the program's execution. This effectively prevents any further code from being executed, including any potential unintended behavior that might arise from missing a default case.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
