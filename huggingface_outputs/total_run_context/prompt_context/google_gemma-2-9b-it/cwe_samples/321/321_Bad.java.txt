VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code directly compares the input password with a hard-coded cryptographic key ("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b"). This is a major security vulnerability as the key is exposed in the source code, making it trivial for attackers to retrieve and decrypt any data protected by this mechanism
