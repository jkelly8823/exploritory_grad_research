VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code directly embeds the cryptographic key "68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b" within the source code. This hard-coded key presents a significant security vulnerability. An attacker who gains access to the code can easily extract the key, compromising the security of any encrypted data
