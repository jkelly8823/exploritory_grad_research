VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code allows an attacker to drop any database by providing a database name as input to the `removeDatabase` method. This is a dangerous vulnerability because it allows an attacker to delete critical data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Restrict database deletion:** Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or roles can drop databases. This could involve using database roles, permissions, or authentication
