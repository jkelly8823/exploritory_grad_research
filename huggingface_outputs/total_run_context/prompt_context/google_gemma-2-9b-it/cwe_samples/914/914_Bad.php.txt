VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack due to the use of `extract($_POST)`.  The `extract()` function allows variables from an array to be directly assigned as local variables. If an attacker can control the contents of the `$_POST` array, they could inject malicious PHP code that will be executed when `extract()` is called.
