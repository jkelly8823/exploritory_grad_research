VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code directly includes a file specified by the user-supplied `$dir` variable without any sanitization or validation. This is a classic example of a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-98). An attacker could manipulate the `$dir` parameter to include arbitrary files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or disclosure of sensitive information.
