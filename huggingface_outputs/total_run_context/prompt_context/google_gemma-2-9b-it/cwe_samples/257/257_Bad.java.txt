VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code stores passwords in a compressed format (`compressed_password`). While compression might seem like a security measure, it doesn't address the core issue of storing passwords in a recoverable format.  An attacker who gains access to the system could potentially reverse the compression algorithm and retrieve the original passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Hash Passwords:** Instead of storing passwords directly, hash them
