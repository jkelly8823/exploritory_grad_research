VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code stores passwords in a compressed format (`compressed_password`). While compression might seem like a security measure, it doesn't address the core issue of storing passwords in a recoverable format.  An attacker who gains access to the compressed password can potentially decompress it, revealing the plaintext password. This vulnerability allows for password reuse attacks and exposes the system to significant security risks.
