VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
EXPLANATION:
The code registers a BroadcastReceiver without any explicit checks on the source of the broadcast. An attacker could potentially send a malicious broadcast with the "com.example.RemoveUser" action, leading to unintended data deletion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a mechanism to verify the source of the broadcast, such as checking the sending application's package name or using a secure communication channel.
