VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allows execution of arbitrary code based on a URL scheme and resource specifier. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a specific scheme ("exampleScheme") and a resource specifier starting with "specialFunction" to execute arbitrary code within the context of the webview. This is a classic example of a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
