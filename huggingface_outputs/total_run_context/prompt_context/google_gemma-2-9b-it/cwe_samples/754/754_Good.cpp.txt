EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates basic error handling by checking the return values of functions `openFileToWrite`, `writeToFile`, and `closeFile`. If any of these functions return an error code (presumably `FAIL`), the code prints an error message and sets the `isOutput` variable to `FAIL`. This indicates that the code is attempting to handle potential exceptions and unusual conditions.
