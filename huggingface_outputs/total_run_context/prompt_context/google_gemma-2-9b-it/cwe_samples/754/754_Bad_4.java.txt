VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,12
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the case where the `readFile` object is null. This can lead to a `NullPointerException` when attempting to create a `FileReader` object in the `readFromFile` method.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Check if `readFile` is null before creating the `FileReader` object.
- Throw an appropriate exception if `readFile` is null
