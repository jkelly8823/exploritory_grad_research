VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the `strcpy` function does not check the length of the source buffer (`buf`). If the user inputs more than 9 characters, the `strcpy` function will write past the end of the destination buffer (`cp_buf`), potentially overwriting other data in memory. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or even remote code execution.
