VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to buffer overflow. Specifically, the line `if (num > 0 && num <= (unsigned)count)` checks if the received `num` value is within the bounds of the `sizes` array. However, the code does not explicitly validate the size of the `sizes` array itself. If an attacker can manipulate the `
