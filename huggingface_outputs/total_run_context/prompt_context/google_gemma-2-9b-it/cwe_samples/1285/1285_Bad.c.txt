VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11,12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of `sscanf` without bounds checking. The `sscanf` function reads data from the `buf` buffer and attempts to parse it into two integers, `num` and `size`. If the input data is longer than expected, it can overflow the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a
