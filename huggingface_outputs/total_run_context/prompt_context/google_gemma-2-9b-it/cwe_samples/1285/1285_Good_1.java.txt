VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a proper attempt to handle potential `IndexOutOfBoundsException` by using a `try-catch` block. The `get()` method of the `ArrayList` class is designed to throw this exception if the provided index is out of bounds. The `catch` block gracefully handles this exception, preventing the program from crashing.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
