VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to IndexOutOfBoundsException. The `displayProductSummary` method calls `getProductSummary` with the `index` parameter. However, there is no validation to ensure that the `index` is within the bounds of the `products` array. If the `index` is out of range, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown.
