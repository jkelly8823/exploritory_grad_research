VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks sufficient protection against brute-force attacks. The `sleep(2000)` function introduces a 2-second delay after each authentication attempt. However, this delay is insufficient to deter determined attackers who can easily launch attacks with rapid succession.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to restrict the number of authentication attempts within a specific timeframe.
-
