VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate any direct implementation of authentication logic or any measures to prevent brute force attacks. It only shows the retrieval of username and password parameters from a request.  To determine if the vulnerability exists, we would need to see the implementation of the `authenticateUser` function and any logic related to handling failed login attempts.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
