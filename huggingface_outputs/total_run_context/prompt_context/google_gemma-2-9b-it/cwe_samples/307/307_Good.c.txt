EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet lacks sufficient protection against brute-force attacks. It allows for multiple authentication attempts within a loop without any rate limiting or lockout mechanism. The `count < MAX_ATTEMPTS` condition allows for a maximum of `MAX_ATTEMPTS` failed attempts before the loop terminates.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a rate limiting mechanism to restrict the
