VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the `strcpy` function does not check the length of the input string (`argv[1]`). If the input string is longer than `BUFSIZE`, it will write beyond the allocated memory for `buf1`, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer string copy function like `strncpy` that takes a maximum length argument
