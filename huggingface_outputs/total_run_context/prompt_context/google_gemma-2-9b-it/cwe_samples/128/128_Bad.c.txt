VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to integer overflow.  

Line 6: `table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);`

If `num_imgs` is a large enough value, multiplying it by the size of `img_t` could exceed the maximum value an integer can hold. This would result
