VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to bind a socket to port 21, which is the standard port for FTP. If another service is already bound to this port, the code will likely fail to bind or may result in a conflict. This can lead to a denial of service or allow an attacker to spoof legitimate services.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Choose a non-standard port for the service
