VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential vulnerability of dividing by zero. If `numRequests` is zero, the expression `totalTime / numRequests` will result in an arithmetic exception.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check to ensure that `numRequests` is not zero before performing the division. For example:

```java
public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests)
