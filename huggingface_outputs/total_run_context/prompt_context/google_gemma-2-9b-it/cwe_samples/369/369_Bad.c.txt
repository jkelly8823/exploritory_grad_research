VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential vulnerability of division by zero. The function `divide` divides the input `x` by `y` without any check to ensure that `y` is not zero. If `y` is zero, the code will result in a runtime error (division by zero).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check to ensure that `y` is not zero before performing the
