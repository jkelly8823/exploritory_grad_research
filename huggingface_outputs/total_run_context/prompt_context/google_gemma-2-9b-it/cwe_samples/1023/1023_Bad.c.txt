VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a vulnerability related to insecure password comparison. Specifically, it relies on `strlen` to determine the length of the input password and compares it against the hardcoded password. This is problematic because:

1. **Truncation Vulnerability:** If the input password is shorter than the hardcoded password, the comparison will always fail, potentially leading to a false negative
