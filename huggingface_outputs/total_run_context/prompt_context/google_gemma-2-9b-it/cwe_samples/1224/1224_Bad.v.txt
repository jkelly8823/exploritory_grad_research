VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not exhibit the vulnerability described in CWE_ID 1224. The "sticky bits" or write-once behavior is implemented using a single register (`Write_once_status`) that is set based on the input data. 

While the code allows for reprogramming of the `Write_once_status` bit, it is not a hardware design control register
