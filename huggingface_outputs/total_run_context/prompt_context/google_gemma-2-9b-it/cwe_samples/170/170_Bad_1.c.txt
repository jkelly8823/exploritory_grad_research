VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided uses `readlink(pathname, buf, MAXPATH)`, which is a system call designed to read a symbolic link and store its contents in the buffer `buf`. This function is expected to properly null-terminate the string it writes to the buffer. 

Therefore, it is unlikely that the code suffers from CWE-170 (Improper Null Termination).
