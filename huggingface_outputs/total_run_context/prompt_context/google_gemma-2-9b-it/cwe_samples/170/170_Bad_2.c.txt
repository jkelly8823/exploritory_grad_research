VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strncpy` function is used to copy data from the `longString` array to the `shortString` array. However, the length of `longString` (which is 24 characters) exceeds the size of `shortString` (16 characters). This can lead to data overwriting beyond the allocated memory for `
