VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not null-terminate the `inputbuf` after reading data from the file. This can lead to buffer overflows when `strcpy` is used to copy the data into `pathbuf`. `strcpy` expects a null-terminated string as input and will write beyond the allocated memory if the input is not null-terminated.
