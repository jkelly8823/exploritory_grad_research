EXPLANATION:
The code lacks proper logging of login attempts, specifically failing to log successful logins. This can hinder security analysis by making it difficult to track user activity and identify potential compromise.

- Consider using a dedicated logging library for improved logging functionality and centralized management.
- Implement a mechanism to store and analyze login attempt
