VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks proper indentation or braces to define a code block within the `if` statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior as `Do_X()` and `Do_Y()` might not execute as intended, especially if the `condition` is false.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Indentation:** Use consistent indentation to visually separate the code block within the `if` statement
