VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strcpy` function copies the contents of the input string (`string`) into the fixed-size buffer (`buf`), which has a size of 24 bytes. If the input string is longer than 24 bytes, `strcpy` will write beyond the allocated memory for `buf`, leading to a buffer overflow.
