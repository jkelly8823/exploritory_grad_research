VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to OS Command Injection. The `$userName` variable, which is taken from user input (`$_POST["user"]`), is directly concatenated into the `$command` string without any sanitization or escaping. This means that an attacker could provide malicious input in the `user` field, which would be executed as part of the `ls -l` command.
