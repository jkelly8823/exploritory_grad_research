VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 7
EXPLANATION:
The variable `aN` is assigned a value on line 7, but it is not initialized before use. This can lead to unpredictable behavior as the value of `aN` could be anything.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the variable `aN` before use. For example:

```
int aN = 0;
```
