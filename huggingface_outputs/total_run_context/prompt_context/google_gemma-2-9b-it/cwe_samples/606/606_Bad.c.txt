VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-606: Improper Loop Condition Check. The `iterate` function takes an integer `n` as input and uses it to control the loop counter `i`. The input `n` is not validated, meaning a malicious user could provide a very large value for `n`, causing the loop to iterate excessively and potentially leading to a denial of service.
