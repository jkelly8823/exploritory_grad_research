EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not explicitly check the value of `msg->msgLength` before using it in the `for` loop. If `msg->msgLength` is a user-controlled input, an attacker could potentially provide a maliciously large value, leading to an infinite loop or a denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `msg->msgLength`
