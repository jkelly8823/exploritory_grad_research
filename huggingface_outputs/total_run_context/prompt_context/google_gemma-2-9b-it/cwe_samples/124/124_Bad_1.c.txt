VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strcpy` function copies data from `srcBuf` into `destBuf` starting at the index specified by `idx`. However, there's no check to ensure that `idx` is within the bounds of `destBuf`. If `srcBuf` is larger than the remaining space in `destBuf` starting at `idx
