VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-73 (Path Traversal) because the `reportName` parameter, which is obtained from user input, is directly concatenated with the file path without any sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious filename that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., "..") to access files outside the intended "reports" directory, potentially leading to data leaks,
