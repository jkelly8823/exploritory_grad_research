EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `strncpy` which is designed to prevent buffer overflows.  `strncpy` takes a maximum length as the third argument, ensuring that it only copies up to that many characters from the source buffer. In this case, `sizeof(source)-1` is passed as the maximum length, correctly limiting the copy to 20 characters (the size of `source` minus
