VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the `strncpy` function does not guarantee null-termination. If the length of the input filename is greater than `LOG_INPUT_SIZE - 1`, the `strncpy` function will write beyond the bounds of the `buf` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `snprintf` instead
