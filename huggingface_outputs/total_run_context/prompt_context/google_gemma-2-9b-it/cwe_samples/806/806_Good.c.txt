EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strncpy` function is used to copy data from the `source` buffer to the `dest` buffer. However, the size of the destination buffer (`dest`) is only 12 bytes, while the source buffer (`source`) contains 21 bytes. 

Even though `sizeof(dest)-1` is used as the
