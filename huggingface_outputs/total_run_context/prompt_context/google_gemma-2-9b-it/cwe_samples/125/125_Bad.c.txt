VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it accesses `array[index]` even when `index` is greater than or equal to `len`. This can lead to reading memory outside the bounds of the allocated array, potentially causing a crash or security exploit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Modify the code to check for `index < len` before accessing `array[index]`.
