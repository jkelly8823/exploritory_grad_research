VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow because the `strcpy` function is used without any bounds checking. If the length of `argv[1]` (the first command-line argument) exceeds `BUFSIZE` (256), the `strcpy` function will write beyond the allocated memory for the `buf` array, overwriting adjacent stack variables. This can lead
