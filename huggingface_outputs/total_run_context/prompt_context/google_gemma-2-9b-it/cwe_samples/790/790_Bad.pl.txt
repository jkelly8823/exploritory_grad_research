VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The `s/\.\.\///;` regular expression attempts to remove ".." sequences from the username, but it's insufficient to prevent all directory traversal attempts. An attacker could craft a username containing multiple ".." sequences or other special characters that bypass this simple filtering.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use a more robust input validation library or function
