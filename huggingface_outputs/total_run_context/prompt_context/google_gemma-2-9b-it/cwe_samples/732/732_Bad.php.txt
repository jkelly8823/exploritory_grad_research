VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `mkdir()` and `chown()` to create a directory and set its ownership. However, it does not sanitize the `$username` input. This means that an attacker could provide a malicious username containing path traversal characters (e.g., "..") to potentially access or modify files outside the intended directory structure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the `$username` input
