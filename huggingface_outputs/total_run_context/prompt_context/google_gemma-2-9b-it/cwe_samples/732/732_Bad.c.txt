VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The `umask(0)` function call sets the file creation mask to 0. This means that any newly created file will have all permissions set (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others. This is a security vulnerability because it allows unintended actors to read or modify the file `hello.out`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the `umask(0)`
