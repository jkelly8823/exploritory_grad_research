EXPLANATION:
The code snippet stores the user's account ID (`acctID`) in a cookie named "userAccountID" without any encryption or hashing. This directly exposes the sensitive information to potential attackers who can intercept the cookie.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Encrypt or hash the `acctID` before storing it in the cookie.
- Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as session tokens
