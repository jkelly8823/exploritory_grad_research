EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a clear attempt to initialize a resource and subsequently fail to do so correctly. The `login_user` function is assumed to handle user authentication and return a boolean value indicating success or failure. The code then uses this result to determine whether to proceed with generating a page. There is no indication of a resource being initialized improperly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
