EXPLANATION:
The function `generateSessionID` uses `srand($userID)` to seed the random number generator. However, using a user ID as the seed makes the session ID predictable. An attacker could potentially guess future session IDs by incrementing the user ID and calling the function repeatedly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) instead of `rand
