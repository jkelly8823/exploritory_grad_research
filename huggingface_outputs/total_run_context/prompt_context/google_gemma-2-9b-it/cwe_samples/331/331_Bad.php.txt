EXPLANATION:
The function `generateSessionID` uses `srand($userID)` to seed the random number generator. However, using a user ID as the seed is highly problematic.  Since user IDs are often sequential or predictable, this will result in a predictable sequence of random numbers. An attacker could potentially predict future session IDs, leading to session hijacking or other attacks.
