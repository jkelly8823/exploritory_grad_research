VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `buf.nameID` field is assigned the address of the character after the `defaultMessage` string. If `defaultMessage` is modified or comes from an untrusted source, an attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize user input before using it to modify
