VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code directly stores passwords in plain text, which is a severe security vulnerability. This allows attackers to easily access and steal user credentials if the system is compromised.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Hash passwords securely:** Instead of storing passwords in plain text, hash them using a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or Argon2.
- **Salt passwords:** Add a unique random salt to each password
