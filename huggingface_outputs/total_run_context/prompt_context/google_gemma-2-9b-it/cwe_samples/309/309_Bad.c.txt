VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code directly compares a plaintext password with a stored hash, which is a major security vulnerability.  This means that if an attacker gains access to the stored hash, they can easily crack the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Store passwords as hashes:** Never store passwords in plain text. Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to generate a unique hash for each password.
