EXPLANATION:
The comment "// Add the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose" is misleading. It suggests that the calculation is performed within the commented block, but the actual calculation is done in the line "daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg;" which is outside the comment.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the comment to accurately reflect the code'
