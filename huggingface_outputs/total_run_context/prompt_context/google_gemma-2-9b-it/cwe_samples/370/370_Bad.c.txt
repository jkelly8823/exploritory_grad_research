VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,9
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to certificate revocation checking (CWE-370). 

The code initially verifies the certificate using `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)`. If the verification is successful (`X509_V_OK`), it proceeds to execute actions. However, the code lacks a mechanism to re-check the certificate's
