EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet implements access control checks for CSR (Control and Status Register) accesses. It verifies both privilege level compatibility and access to debug mode-specific CSRs. 

The code ensures that:

- Access to CSRs is restricted based on the current privilege level (`priv_lvl_o & csr_addr.csr_decode.priv_lvl`).
- Access to
