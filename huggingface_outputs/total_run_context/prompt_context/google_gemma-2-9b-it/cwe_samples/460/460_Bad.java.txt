VULNERABLE_LINES: 19,20
EXPLANATION:
The code does not properly clean up the `threadLock` variable within the `catch` block. If an exception is thrown, the `threadLock` variable may retain its value, leading to potential issues in subsequent executions or in other parts of the code that rely on its state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set `threadLock` to a known default value
