VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet validates the input dimensions `m` and `n` against the `MAX_DIM` constant. If either dimension exceeds `MAX_DIM`, the program terminates with an error message. This validation prevents the potential for buffer overflows or other issues that could arise from accepting excessively large dimensions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
