VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `outputDirectoryName` buffer is fixed at 128 characters.  The `getCurrentDirectory` function, `PathAppend`, and the potential concatenation of the `name` parameter could result in a path exceeding 128 characters. If this happens, data will overflow the buffer, potentially
