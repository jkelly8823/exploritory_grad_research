VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code directly assigns the user input obtained from `request.getParameter("usrname")` to the session attribute `ATTR_USR` without any sanitization or validation. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could inject malicious code or data into the session, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the user input before storing it in the session.
