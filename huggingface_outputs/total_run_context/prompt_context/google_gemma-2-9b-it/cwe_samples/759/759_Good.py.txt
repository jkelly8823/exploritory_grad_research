VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses MD5 to hash passwords, which is a known weak hashing algorithm. More importantly, it does not use a unique salt for each user, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. An attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords with a fixed salt and then easily crack passwords stored in the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a stronger hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2
