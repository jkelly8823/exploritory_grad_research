VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code uses SHA to hash a password without salting. This means that if an attacker obtains a list of hashed passwords, they can use a rainbow table or other precomputed hash table to easily find the corresponding plaintext passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add a unique salt to each password before hashing.
- Use a stronger hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2.
- Store
