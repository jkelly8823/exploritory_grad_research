VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a one-way cryptographic hash function (SHA1) to store passwords. However, it lacks the use of a salt, which is a crucial security measure. Without a salt, attackers can use pre-computed hash tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords efficiently.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Implement a unique salt for each user:** Generate a random salt for each user
