VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The code uses MD5 to hash passwords without salting. This is a known vulnerability (CWE-759) because MD5 is a weak hash function and attackers can use pre-computed tables to crack unsalted MD5 hashes relatively easily.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a stronger hash function like bcrypt or Argon2.
- Always salt passwords before hashing. A salt is
