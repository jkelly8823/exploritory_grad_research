VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `srand(time())` to seed the random number generator. While this might seem sufficient, using the current time as a seed can lead to predictable sequences of random numbers if an attacker has knowledge of past executions or can manipulate the system clock. This makes the generated numbers vulnerable to attacks that rely on predictable randomness, such as brute-force attacks or cryptographic attacks.
