VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `System.currentTimeMillis()` as the seed for the `Random` object. While this provides some level of randomness, it's not cryptographically secure. An attacker with knowledge of the system's timing could potentially predict the generated random numbers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like `SecureRandom`.
