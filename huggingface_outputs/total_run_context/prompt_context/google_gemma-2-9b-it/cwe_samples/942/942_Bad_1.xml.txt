VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet represents a cross-domain policy file (`.cross-domain.xml`) that allows access from any domain (`uri="*"`). This is a security vulnerability because it opens the application to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks from untrusted sources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Restrict the allowed domains to only those that are explicitly trusted.
