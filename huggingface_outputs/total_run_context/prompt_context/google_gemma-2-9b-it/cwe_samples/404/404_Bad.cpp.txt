VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential resource leak vulnerability. 
The `malloc()` function allocates memory for an integer, but the `delete` statement is used to deallocate it. `delete` is intended for objects managed by a smart pointer or the heap, not for memory allocated with `malloc()`. This mismatch in memory management can lead to a memory leak.
