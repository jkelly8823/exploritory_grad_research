VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8,9
EXPLANATION:
The code calls `free(buf1R1)` and `free(buf2R1)` twice. This is a classic example of double free vulnerability. When a memory block is freed, it is marked as available for reuse. Calling `free()` on the same memory block again can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, memory corruption, and security exploits.
