VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates a classic double-free vulnerability.  The `free(ptr)` call on line 10 releases the memory pointed to by `ptr`. However, the subsequent `free(ptr)` call on line 14 attempts to free the same memory again. This can lead to undefined behavior, including memory corruption, crashes, or security exploits.
