EXPLANATION:
The provided code defines signal handlers for SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals. These handlers attempt to free dynamically allocated memory (global1 and global2) and then exit the process. The issue is that signal handlers are not guaranteed to be executed atomically. If a signal arrives while the handler is in the process of freeing memory, it could lead to a race condition.
