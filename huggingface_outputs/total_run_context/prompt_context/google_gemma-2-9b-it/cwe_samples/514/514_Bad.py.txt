VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit characteristics of a covert channel vulnerability (CWE-514). 

Covert channels typically involve exploiting unintended information leakage through seemingly benign system operations, such as timing, resource usage, or side-channel effects. The code simply compares the lengths and character-by-character equality of two passwords. There's no indication of information being leaked through timing variations
