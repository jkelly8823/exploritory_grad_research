VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code declares a public finalize() method in the urlTool class. This violates the secure coding principle of not exposing finalize() methods publicly. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code when the object is garbage collected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Make the finalize() method private.
- Avoid using finalize() whenever possible. Consider using other mechanisms for cleanup tasks.
