VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection because it directly concatenates user input from `request.getParameter("streetAddress")` with a string without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious input containing CRLF sequences, which could be interpreted as line breaks by the logger, potentially leading to unexpected output formatting or even code execution if the logger is vulnerable to further injection.
