VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a vulnerability related to insecure string comparison. Specifically, lines 7 and 10 utilize `strlen(inUser)` and `strlen(inPass)` within the `strncmp` function. This practice is problematic because it can lead to buffer overflows if the input strings (`inUser` and `inPass`) are longer than the allocated memory for the
