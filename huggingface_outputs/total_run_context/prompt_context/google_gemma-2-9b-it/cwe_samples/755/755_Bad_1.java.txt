VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to exception handling. Specifically, the `catch` block catches a `NullPointerException` but does not handle it in any meaningful way. This means that if a `NullPointerException` occurs within `mysteryMethod()`, the exception will be caught, but the program will continue to execute without addressing the underlying issue. This can lead to unexpected behavior
