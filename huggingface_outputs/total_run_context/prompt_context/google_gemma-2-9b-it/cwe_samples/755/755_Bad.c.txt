VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability by failing to handle a potential memory allocation failure. The `malloc()` function can return `NULL` if memory allocation is unsuccessful. In this case, the code checks for `NULL` but does nothing if it occurs. This means that the program will continue executing even if it cannot allocate the necessary memory, leading to a potential crash or undefined behavior.
