VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The variable 'r' is assigned a value in both lines.  The first line assigns the result of the 'getName()' function call to 'r'. The second line then reassigns 'r' with the result of the 'getNewBuffer(buf)' function call.  While the first assignment might seem unused, it's possible that the value returned by 'getName()' is used
