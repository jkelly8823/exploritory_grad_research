VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code exhibits a vulnerability by using a hardcoded allowlist (`acl_oh_allowlist`) for authentication. This is a security risk because an attacker could potentially discover the allowlist and bypass authentication by sending requests with IDs matching the allowed values. Additionally, the code uses a simple comparison (`address == 32'hF00`) for address authentication,
