VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:

The `strcpy` function copies the contents of the input string (`string`) into the fixed-size buffer `buf` without any bounds checking. If the input string is longer than 24 characters, it will overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a security breach.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
