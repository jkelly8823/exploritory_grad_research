VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a hard-coded password "Mew!" within the `VerifyAdmin` function. This directly exposes the password in the source code, making it vulnerable to attackers who gain access to the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Do not hardcode passwords:**  Instead of storing passwords directly in the code, use environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management system
