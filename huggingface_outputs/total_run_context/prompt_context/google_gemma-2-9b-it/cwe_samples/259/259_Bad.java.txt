VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses hardcoded credentials ("scott" and "tiger") for connecting to a database. This directly exposes the password in the source code, making it vulnerable to attackers who gain access to the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information like database credentials.
- Implement secure credential management practices, such as using a secrets management system.
