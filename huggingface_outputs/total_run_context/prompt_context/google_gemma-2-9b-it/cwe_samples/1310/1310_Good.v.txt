The provided code snippet does not demonstrate any vulnerabilities related to patching ROM code. 
The code defines two instances of a `bootrom` module, one for patching (`i_bootrom_patch`) and one for Linux (`i_bootrom_linux`). It then uses a multiplexer (`assign rom_rdata`) to select the output data based on a signal (`ariane_boot
