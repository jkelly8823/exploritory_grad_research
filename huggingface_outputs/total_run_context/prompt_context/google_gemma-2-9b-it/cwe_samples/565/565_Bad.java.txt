VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet directly uses cookies to determine the user's role without any validation or authentication. This is a vulnerability because an attacker could manipulate the cookies to assume a role they are not authorized for. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate User Role:** Implement a mechanism to verify the user's role against a trusted source (e.g., database, authentication system)
