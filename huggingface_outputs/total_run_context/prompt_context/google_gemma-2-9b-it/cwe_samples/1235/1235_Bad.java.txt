VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not exhibit the vulnerability described. While it does use the `Long` data type, it's not using boxed primitives in a way that would introduce inefficiencies. 

The code iterates through a loop and adds each integer value to a `Long` variable.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
