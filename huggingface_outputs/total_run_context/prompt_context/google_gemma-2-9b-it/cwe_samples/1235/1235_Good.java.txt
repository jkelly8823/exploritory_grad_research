VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not exhibit the vulnerability described. While it does use the `long` data type, it's not using boxed primitives. Boxed primitives are objects that wrap primitive data types (like `int`, `long`, `double`, etc.). The code directly uses the `long` primitive type.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
