VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to certificate validation. While it retrieves the peer certificate using `SSL_get_peer_certificate()`, it fails to utilize `SSL_get_verify_result()` to assess the certificate's validity. This omission could allow the application to trust a compromised or invalid certificate, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks
