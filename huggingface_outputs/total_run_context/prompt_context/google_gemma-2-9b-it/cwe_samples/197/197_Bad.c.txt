VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to calculate the maximum value for an integer and then casts it to a short.  The issue is that the maximum value for an integer may exceed the maximum value for a short. This can lead to a truncation error where data is lost during the cast.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the data type used for the calculation is compatible with the target data type.
