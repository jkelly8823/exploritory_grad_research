VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes the random number generator (rand()) using `srand(time())`. While using the current time as a seed seems random, it's not truly unpredictable. If an attacker knows the time at which the code is executed, they can predict the seed and therefore all subsequent random numbers generated. This makes the PRNG vulnerable to attacks that rely on predictable randomness.
