VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes a Random object using System.currentTimeMillis() as the seed. While System.currentTimeMillis() provides a seemingly random value, it is predictable and can be easily determined by an attacker if they have access to the system's time. This makes the generated random numbers predictable and therefore vulnerable to attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (
