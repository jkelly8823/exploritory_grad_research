VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided does not exhibit the characteristics of a buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-119). 

Here's why:

* **Bounded Memory Allocation:** The code explicitly allocates memory for `dst_buf` using `malloc(4 * sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE)`. This ensures that the destination buffer has a fixed size determined by `MAX_
