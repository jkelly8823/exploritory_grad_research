VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the `if` statement does not prevent writing to an invalid array index. If `index` is greater than or equal to `len`, the code will still access `array[index]`, potentially writing to memory outside the bounds of the allocated array. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
