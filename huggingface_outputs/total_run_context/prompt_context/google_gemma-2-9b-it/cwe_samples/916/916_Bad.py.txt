VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is known to be insecure and easily crackable.  MD5 produces a 128-bit hash, which is considered too short for modern security standards.  
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2. These algorithms are designed to be resistant to brute-force attacks and provide a higher
