VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is known to be insecure and easily crackable.  It's highly recommended to use stronger hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password storage.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `hashlib.md5` with `bcrypt` or `argon2`.
2.  Use a more robust salt generation method.
