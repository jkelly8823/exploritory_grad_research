VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it allocates memory based on the user-supplied `num_imgs` variable without any bounds checking. If `num_imgs` is larger than the expected value, the `malloc` call will allocate more memory than necessary, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the `num_imgs` input to
