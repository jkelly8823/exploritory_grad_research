VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not properly validate the size of the buffer allocated for `headers`. The `malloc` function allocates memory based on the size provided, but if `numHeaders` is larger than the available memory, it can lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that `numHeaders` is within a safe range before allocating memory
