EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic case of double-free vulnerability. 
It allocates memory using `malloc` and stores the pointer in `ptr`. 
If `abrt` is true, the memory is freed using `free(ptr)`. However, regardless of the value of `abrt`, the code always attempts to free the memory again using `free(
