VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code calls `bind()` twice. The first call is within the `bind_socket()` function, and the second call is outside the function. This is a potential vulnerability because the `bind()` function should only be called once to associate a socket with a specific address and port. Calling it multiple times can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the second call
