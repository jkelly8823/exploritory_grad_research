VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential vulnerability related to resource exhaustion (CWE-400). The `while (1)` loop creates an infinite loop, continuously accepting new connections.  Without proper resource management, this can lead to a situation where the system runs out of available file descriptors or other system resources. Each accepted connection consumes a file descriptor, and if the loop continues indefinitely, it can
