VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11,12,13,14
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential resource exhaustion vulnerability due to the lack of proper control over the number of concurrent connections. 

The `MAX_CONNECTIONS` constant is set to 10, limiting the maximum number of threads that can be created by the thread pool. However, the `while (hasConnections)` loop
