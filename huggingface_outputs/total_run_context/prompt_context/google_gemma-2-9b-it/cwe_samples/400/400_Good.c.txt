VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a vulnerability related to resource exhaustion (CWE-400). 

The code checks if the `length` of a message is within a valid range (`0` to `MAX_LENGTH`). This suggests a basic bounds check to prevent buffer overflows or other issues that could lead to resource exhaustion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
