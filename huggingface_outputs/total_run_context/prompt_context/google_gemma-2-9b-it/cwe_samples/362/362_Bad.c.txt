VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-9

While the code uses `pthread_mutex_lock()` and `pthread_mutex_unlock()` to protect access to a shared resource, there's a possibility of a race condition if multiple threads attempt to acquire the mutex concurrently.

If two threads call `pthread_mutex_lock()` simultaneously, one thread might
