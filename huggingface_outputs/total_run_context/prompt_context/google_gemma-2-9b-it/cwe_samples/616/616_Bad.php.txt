VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a classic vulnerability related to file uploads in PHP. It relies on the outdated practice of using global variables (`$varname`, `$varname_size`, `$varname_name`, `$varname_type`) to handle file upload data. This approach is highly susceptible to attacks because these global variables can be easily manipulated by malicious users.
