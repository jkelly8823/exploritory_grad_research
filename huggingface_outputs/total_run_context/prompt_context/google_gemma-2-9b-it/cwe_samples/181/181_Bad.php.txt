VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The `strpos($dirName,'..') !== false` check only prevents the use of ".." to go up one directory level. However, it does not prevent the use of other sequences that could lead to arbitrary file access. For example, an attacker could use sequences like "/../" or "///" to navigate outside the intended directory structure
