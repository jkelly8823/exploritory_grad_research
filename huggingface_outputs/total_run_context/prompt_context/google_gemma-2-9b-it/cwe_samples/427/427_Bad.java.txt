VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make")`, which executes an external command.  If the "make" command is not in a controlled environment, an attacker could potentially manipulate the command line arguments or the working directory to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability aligns with CWE-427 as the execution path is not explicitly controlled.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize
