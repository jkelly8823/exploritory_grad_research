VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates a double close operation on the file pointer `f`. The `fclose(f)` call on line 10 attempts to close the file after it has already been closed on line 9. This is a potential vulnerability as it can lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the redundant `fclose(f)` call on line 10
