VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code directly retrieves user credentials (`$user` and `$pass`) from the query string using `$_GET`. This is highly insecure as it exposes these sensitive values in the URL, making them vulnerable to interception by malicious actors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Never transmit sensitive information like passwords in plain text through URLs.**
- **Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication channel.**
