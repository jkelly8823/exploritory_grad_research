VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet directly exposes the database username ("db2admin") and password ("password") within the connection string. This is a severe security vulnerability as it allows anyone with access to the code or the file containing this string to directly read the credentials.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive information like database credentials in environment variables and access them within the code.
-
