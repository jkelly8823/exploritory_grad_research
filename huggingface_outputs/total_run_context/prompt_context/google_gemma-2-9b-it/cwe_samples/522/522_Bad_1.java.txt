VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves a password from a registry key and stores it in a string variable. This password is then used to create a NetworkCredential object, which is used for authentication. The issue is that the password is stored in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception and retrieval by unauthorized parties.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method for storing passwords, such as hashing or encryption.
