VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code directly compares a user-supplied password with a stored password without any form of secure hashing. This is a major vulnerability as it allows attackers to easily retrieve the stored password if they gain access to the code or database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a strong, cryptographically secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to hash passwords before storing them.
- Never store passwords in
