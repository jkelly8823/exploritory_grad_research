VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3

The code reads a password directly from a configuration file ("config.properties") using plain text. This is a major security vulnerability as the password is stored in an insecure manner and can be easily accessed by anyone with access to the file.

- **Encrypt configuration
