VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the `gets()` function to read user input into the `buf` array. The `gets()` function does not have a size limit and will read input until a newline character is encountered. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the user enters more than 23 characters (remembering that the null terminator '\0' is also required).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
