VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate the vulnerability described in CWE_672.  The code allocates memory using `malloc`, assigns a pointer to it, and then processes the data.  The `free` statement is called if the processing fails, ensuring the allocated memory is released. There is no indication that the code continues to use the memory after it has been freed.
