EXPLANATION:
The code logs the SQL query used to retrieve user account information. This can be a security risk as an attacker could analyze the logged query to understand the database schema and potentially identify sensitive information or vulnerabilities.

- Avoid logging sensitive information like SQL queries.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Log only necessary information and sanitize it before logging.
