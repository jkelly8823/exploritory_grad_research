VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,7
EXPLANATION:
The code has a classic double-free vulnerability.  The `free(ptr)` call on line 6 is executed if `abrt` is true. The subsequent `free(ptr)` call on line 7 will always be executed, regardless of the value of `abrt`. This leads to a double-free, which can cause memory corruption and program crashes.
