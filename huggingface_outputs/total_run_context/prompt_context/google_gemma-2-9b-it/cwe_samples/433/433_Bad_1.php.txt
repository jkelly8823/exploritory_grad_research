VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code includes a file named 'database.inc' which is located in the same directory as the PHP script. If this file is not properly sanitized or validated, it could potentially be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is similar to the CWE-433 description, as the inclusion of an external file without proper validation could lead to the execution of malicious code.
