VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow because `num_imgs` is not checked for potential overflow before being used in the `malloc` call. If `get_num_imgs()` returns a very large value, it could potentially overflow the integer data type used to store `num_imgs`. This overflow would result in a smaller value being used for the size of the allocated memory, leading
