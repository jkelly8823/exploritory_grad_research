VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a proper memory handling practice. After allocating a new buffer with `realloc`, the function `scrub_memory` is called to clear the contents of the buffer before it is used. This mitigates the risk of information leakage from the previous contents of the buffer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
