EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a clear pattern of clearing sensitive data (`p_c[i]`) before reuse.  When `ct_valid` is asserted, indicating the completion of an encryption process, the values of `p_c[0]` through `p_c[3]` are explicitly set to 0. This action effectively zeros out the memory locations, mitigating the risk of information
