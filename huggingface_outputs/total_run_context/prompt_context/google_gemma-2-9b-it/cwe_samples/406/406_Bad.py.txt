VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-10
EXPLANATION:
The code lacks any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for incoming UDP traffic. This means an attacker could potentially send a large volume of UDP packets to the server, overwhelming its resources and potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of packets a single client can send within a given timeframe.
-
