VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a session fixation vulnerability. Session fixation typically occurs when a vulnerable application allows an attacker to control the session ID used for authentication. In this case, the code snippet only shows the login process using `lc.login()`. There is no indication that the existing session is not being invalidated or that the attacker has control over the session ID.
