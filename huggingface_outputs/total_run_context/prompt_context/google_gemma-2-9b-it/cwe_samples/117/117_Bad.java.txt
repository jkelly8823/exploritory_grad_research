VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code logs the user-supplied input `val` directly without sanitization. This is a vulnerability because an attacker could craft malicious input that, when logged, could reveal sensitive information or be used for further attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Do not log sensitive user data directly.
- Sanitize user input before logging it. This could involve escaping special characters or using a logging library that
