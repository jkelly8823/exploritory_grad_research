VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11,12,13
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential vulnerability related to buffer overflow. 

Lines 10-13 demonstrate a scenario where the `buffer` array, with a fixed size (`BUFFER_SIZE`), is directly populated with data received from a socket. The code lacks a robust check to ensure that the received data does not exceed the allocated size
