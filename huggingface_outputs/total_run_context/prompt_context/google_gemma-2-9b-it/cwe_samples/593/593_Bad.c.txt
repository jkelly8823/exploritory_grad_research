VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code modifies the SSL context (`ctx`) after an SSL object (`ssl`) has already been created using `SSL_new(ctx)`. This is a potential vulnerability because it can lead to unexpected behavior and security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Modify the code to set all SSL context parameters before creating the SSL object.
- Ensure that any modifications to the SSL context are done
