VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection because it directly constructs a command string using user-supplied input (`$arg`) without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the `$cmd` variable, which will then be executed by the `system()` function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer alternative to `system()`, such as `exec()`
