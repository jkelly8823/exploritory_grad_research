VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not contain an expression that will always evaluate to false. The `if (1 == 0)` condition is a debugging construct and is not intended to be a permanent part of the logic. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the debugging `if` block when the code is finalized.
