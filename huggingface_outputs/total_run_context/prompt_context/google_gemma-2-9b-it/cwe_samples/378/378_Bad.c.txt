VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to temporary file handling (CWE-378). While it checks for successful file opening, it lacks crucial safeguards:

1. **No File Deletion Confirmation:** The `tmpfile()` function creates a temporary file and returns a file pointer. However, the code relies solely on `rmtmp()`, which might not always succeed due to
