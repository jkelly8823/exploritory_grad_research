EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates responsible handling of temporary files. It utilizes `File.createTempFile()` which automatically generates a unique temporary filename and path. The crucial aspect is the `temp.deleteOnExit()` call. This ensures that the temporary file is automatically deleted when the program terminates, mitigating the risk of it being left behind and potentially exploited.
