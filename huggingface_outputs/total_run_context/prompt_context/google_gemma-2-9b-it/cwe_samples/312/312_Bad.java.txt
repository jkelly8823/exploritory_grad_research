EXPLANATION:
The code snippet stores the user's account ID (`acctID`) in a cookie named "userAccountID". Cookies are often sent back and forth between the client and server with each request, making them vulnerable to interception. If an attacker can intercept the cookie, they can gain access to the user's account ID, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches.
