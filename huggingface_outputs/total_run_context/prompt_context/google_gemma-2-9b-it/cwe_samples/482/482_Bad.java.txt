VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The line `foo==1;` is vulnerable to CWE-482. The code intends to assign the value 1 to the variable `foo`, but it uses the equality comparison operator (`==`) instead of the assignment operator (`=`). This will result in a comparison operation, always evaluating to true or false, and not modifying the value of `foo`.
