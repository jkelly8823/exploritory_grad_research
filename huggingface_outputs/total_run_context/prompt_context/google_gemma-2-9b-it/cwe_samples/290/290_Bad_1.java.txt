VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a vulnerability related to authentication. It relies on a shared secret key (`secretKey`) for authentication, which is transmitted in plain text over the network. This makes the secret key susceptible to eavesdropping and spoofing attacks. An attacker could intercept the secret key and impersonate a trusted client, gaining unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a secure authentication
