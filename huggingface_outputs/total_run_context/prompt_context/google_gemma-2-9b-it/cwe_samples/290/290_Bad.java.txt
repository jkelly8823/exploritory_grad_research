EXPLANATION:

However, it relies solely on IP address matching for authentication, which is inherently vulnerable to spoofing attacks. An attacker can easily forge their IP address to appear as one of the approved IPs, bypassing the authentication mechanism.

- Implement a more robust authentication mechanism, such
