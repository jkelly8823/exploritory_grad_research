VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines a `clone()` method that is not declared `final`. This violates the principle of defensive programming against unintended object cloning.  An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious subclass that overrides the `clone()` method and introduces harmful behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Declare the `clone()` method as `final`:

```java
protected final Object clone
