VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to code injection via the `handleConfigAction` function. It takes user input for `action` and `key` parameters, and constructs a string that dynamically evaluates using `eval`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the `$code` variable, which will then be executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using `eval` for dynamic code execution
