VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allows access from any domain (`uri="*"`) to all resources (`path="/" include-subpaths="true"`). This is a potential vulnerability because it does not restrict access to specific domains, allowing any malicious actor to potentially exploit the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Restrict the `allow-from` domain to specific trusted domains.
- Implement additional security measures
