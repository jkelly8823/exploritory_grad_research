VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `*(&a + 1) = 0;` attempts to write a null terminator (`0`) to a memory location one byte past the end of the `a` variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `a` is not allocated enough memory to accommodate the write operation.
