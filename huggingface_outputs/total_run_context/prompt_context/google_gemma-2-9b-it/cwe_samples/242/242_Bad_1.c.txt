VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `gets()` function to read user input. `gets()` is a dangerous function because it does not check the length of the input, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120). If a user enters more than 24 characters, the input will overflow the `buf` buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing a crash or allowing an attacker
