VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `bytesRec` is declared as a `short int`, which typically has a limited range (e.g., -32768 to 32767). The `while` loop repeatedly increments `bytesRec` by the value returned by `getFromInput()`. If `getFromInput()` returns a value
