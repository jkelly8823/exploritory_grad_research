VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11,12,13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow because it uses `short` to store the sum of sales for each month. If the sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` exceeds the maximum value that a `short` can hold, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful results.
