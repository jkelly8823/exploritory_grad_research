VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a clear instance of integer overflow. 

While `num_imgs` is obtained from an external function (`get_num_imgs()`) and used to allocate memory, there's no direct arithmetic operation that suggests a potential overflow. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- It's still good practice to validate the value returned by `get_num_imgs
