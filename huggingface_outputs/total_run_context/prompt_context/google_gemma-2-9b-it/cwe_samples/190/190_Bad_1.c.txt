VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The line `nresp = packet_get_int();` retrieves an integer value from a packet. If this value is very large, it could potentially cause an integer overflow when used in the subsequent calculation `response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));`.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a larger data type:** Consider using a data type with a larger range
