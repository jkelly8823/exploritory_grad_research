EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by replacing occurrences of "script" with a mask. However, this is insufficient.  Attackers can use various other tags and attributes to inject malicious scripts, such as `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. Simply replacing "script" won't address these more sophisticated attacks.
