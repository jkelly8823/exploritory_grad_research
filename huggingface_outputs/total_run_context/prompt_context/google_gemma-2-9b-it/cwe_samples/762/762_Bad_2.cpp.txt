VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates a potential memory leak and potential use-after-free vulnerability. 

Line 7: `delete[] p;`

The code allocates memory dynamically using `new int[2]` if the `heap` flag is set. However, if `heap` is false, the pointer `p` points to a local array `localArray`.
