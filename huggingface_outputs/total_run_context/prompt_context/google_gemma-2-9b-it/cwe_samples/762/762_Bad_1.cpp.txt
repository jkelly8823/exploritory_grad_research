EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using `malloc` but attempts to deallocate it using `delete`. These are incompatible memory management functions. `malloc` allocates memory on the heap, while `delete` is designed for objects managed by the C++ standard library's memory management system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `free(ptr)` to deallocate the memory allocated with `malloc`.
