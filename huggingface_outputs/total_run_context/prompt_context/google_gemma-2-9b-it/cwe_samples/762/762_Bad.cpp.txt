VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free memory allocated using `new` with the `free` function. This is a mismatch and can lead to memory corruption or crashes. `new` allocates memory on the heap and requires deallocation using `delete`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change `free(ptr);` to `delete ptr;`.
