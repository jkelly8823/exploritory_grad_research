EXPLANATION:
The code uses the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the equality comparison operator (`==`) in the `if` statement. This means that the code is always assigning the value `100` to the `value` variable instead of checking if the `value` is equal to `100`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line `if (value=100)`
