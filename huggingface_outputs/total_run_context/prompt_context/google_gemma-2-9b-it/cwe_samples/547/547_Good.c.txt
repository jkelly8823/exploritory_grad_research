VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hard-coded constant `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` with the value 1024. This violates the CWE_547 guideline as it makes the security-critical value inflexible and prone to errors if the buffer size needs to be changed in the future.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Define `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` as an environment variable or configuration parameter
