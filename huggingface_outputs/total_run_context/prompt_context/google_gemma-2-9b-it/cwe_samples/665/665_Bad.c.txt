VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code does not specify a size for the `str` array, which can lead to a buffer overflow. When `strcat` appends "hello world" to `str`, it might write beyond the allocated memory for `str`, potentially overwriting adjacent data and causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the `str` array has a sufficient size to accommodate
