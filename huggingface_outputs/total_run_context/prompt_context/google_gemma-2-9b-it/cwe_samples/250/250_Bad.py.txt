VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code raises privileges (`raisePrivileges()`) before creating the user directory (`os.mkdir()`) and then lowers privileges (`lowerPrivileges()`). This pattern is a potential vulnerability because it allows an attacker to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability within the `raisePrivileges()` function. If an attacker can manipulate the code execution within the elevated privilege context, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to
