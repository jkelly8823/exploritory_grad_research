VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
While this code snippet doesn't directly demonstrate the vulnerability, a session ID length of 8 bytes (64 bits) is considered insufficient for modern security standards.  An attacker could potentially employ brute-force techniques to guess valid session IDs within a reasonable timeframe. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Increase the `idLengthBytes` value to a minimum of 16 bytes (128 bits
