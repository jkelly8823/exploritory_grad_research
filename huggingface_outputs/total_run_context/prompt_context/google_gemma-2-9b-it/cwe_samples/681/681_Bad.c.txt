VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a clear instance of CWE-681 (Data Truncation).  While there's a potential for overflow if `amount` were to exceed the maximum value an `unsigned int` can hold, the code doesn't explicitly perform a conversion from a larger data type to `unsigned int`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
