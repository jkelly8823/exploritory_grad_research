VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses user input from `request.getParameter("catalog")` to set the database catalog. This is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input that modifies the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries
