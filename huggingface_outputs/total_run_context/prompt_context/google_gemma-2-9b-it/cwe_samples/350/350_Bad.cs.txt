VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code performs reverse DNS resolution to determine if a hostname ends with "trustme.com". This is vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks. An attacker could control a DNS server and return a fake hostname for a given IP address, allowing them to bypass security checks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement additional security measures beyond reverse DNS resolution, such as certificate validation or multi-factor authentication.
