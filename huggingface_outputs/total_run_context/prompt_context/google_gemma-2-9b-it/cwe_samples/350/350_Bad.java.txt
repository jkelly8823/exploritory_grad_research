EXPLANATION:
The code performs reverse DNS resolution to check if the hostname ends with "trustme.com". However, it does not validate if the IP address actually belongs to the returned hostname. An attacker could spoof the hostname through DNS poisoning or other techniques, leading to a false positive and bypassing security measures.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement DNSSEC to validate the authenticity of DNS responses.
