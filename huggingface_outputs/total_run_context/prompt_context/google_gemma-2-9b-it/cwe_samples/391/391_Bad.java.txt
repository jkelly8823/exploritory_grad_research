VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability by ignoring a `RareException`. While the comment states "this can never happen," this assumption might be incorrect in real-world scenarios. 

Unhandled exceptions can lead to unexpected program behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit this by triggering the `RareException` and causing the program to behave in a way that benefits
