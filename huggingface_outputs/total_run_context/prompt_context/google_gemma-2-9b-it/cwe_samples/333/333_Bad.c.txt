VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes a function `hwRandom()` which is likely intended to generate a random number. However, the description of the vulnerability (CWE_333) highlights the potential issue with true random number generators (TRNGs) having limited entropy sources. This can lead to predictable or insufficiently random number generation, compromising security if these random numbers are used for critical purposes like session
