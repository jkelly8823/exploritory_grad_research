VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet validates the input path before canonicalization. It checks if the canonicalized path starts with "/safe_dir/". This means that the input is already validated before it is canonicalized, mitigating the risk of the CWE-180 vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
