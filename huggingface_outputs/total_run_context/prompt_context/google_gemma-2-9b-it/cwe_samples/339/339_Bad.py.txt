VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `os.urandom(2)` to obtain a 2-byte seed for the PRNG. This seed space is extremely small (2^16 possible values), making it highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks. An attacker could potentially guess the seed relatively easily, compromising the randomness of the generated key.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a larger seed size. A
