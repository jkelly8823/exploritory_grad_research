VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-601 (Redirection to Malicious URL) because it directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['url']` parameter to construct the `Location` header for a redirect. An attacker could manipulate this parameter to redirect the user to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other security breaches.
