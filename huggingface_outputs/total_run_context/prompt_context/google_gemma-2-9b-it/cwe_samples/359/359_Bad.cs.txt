VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet directly logs a user's password (`pass`) to a log file (`dbmsLog`). This is a severe security vulnerability as it exposes sensitive user data in plain text. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never log passwords in plain text.**
* **Hash passwords before storing or logging them.** Use a strong, industry-standard hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
