VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `choose_bit` function. When `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is true, `reg_bit` is decremented by `bit_number_from_elsewhere`. If `bit_number_from_elsewhere` is greater than or equal to the number of bits in `reg_bit`,
