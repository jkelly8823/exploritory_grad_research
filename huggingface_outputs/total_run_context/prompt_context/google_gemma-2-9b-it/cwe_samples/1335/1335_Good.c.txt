VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the `choose_bit` function, the line `reg_bit -= bit_number_from_elsewhere;` performs a subtraction operation. If `bit_number_from_elsewhere` is greater than or equal to `reg_bit`, the result will be a negative value. This can lead to
