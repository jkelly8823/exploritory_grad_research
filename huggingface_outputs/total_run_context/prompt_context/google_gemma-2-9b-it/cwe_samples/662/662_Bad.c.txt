VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-8
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential race condition vulnerability. While it utilizes a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`) for synchronization, the absence of any explicit checks or mechanisms to handle potential contention or deadlocks raises concerns. 

If multiple threads attempt to acquire the mutex simultaneously, a deadlock could occur, where each thread is waiting for the other to release the mutex. This would effectively
