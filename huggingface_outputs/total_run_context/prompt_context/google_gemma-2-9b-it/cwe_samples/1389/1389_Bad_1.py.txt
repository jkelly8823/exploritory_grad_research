VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `subprocess.call(["ping", validated])` to execute the ping command. The `ping` command treats zero-prepended IP addresses as octal. If the input IP address contains a leading zero, it might be interpreted as an octal value, leading to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a dedicated library for IP address validation that
