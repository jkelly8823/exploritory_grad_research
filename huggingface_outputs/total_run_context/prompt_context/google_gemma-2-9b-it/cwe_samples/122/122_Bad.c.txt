VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap overflow because it uses `strcpy` to copy the contents of `argv[1]` into a buffer of fixed size (`BUFSIZE`). If the length of `argv[1]` exceeds `BUFSIZE`, `strcpy` will write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a heap overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`.
