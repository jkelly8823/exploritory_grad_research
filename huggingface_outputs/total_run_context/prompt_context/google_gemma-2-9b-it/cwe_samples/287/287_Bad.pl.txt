VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to authentication. While it checks for a 'loggedin' cookie, it doesn't verify the user's credentials against a secure storage mechanism (like a database) before setting the 'user' cookie. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'username' and 'password' parameters to gain unauthorized access as an administrator.
