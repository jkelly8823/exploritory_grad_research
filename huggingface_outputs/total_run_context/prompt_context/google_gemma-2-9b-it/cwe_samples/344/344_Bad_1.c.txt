VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses a fixed memory address (0x08040000) to point to a function. This makes the code vulnerable to code injection attacks. An attacker could potentially overwrite this memory address with the address of their own malicious code, which would then be executed when the function is called.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Do not hardcode function addresses.
-
