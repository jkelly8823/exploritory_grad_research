VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hardcoded password "Mew!" for authentication. This is a vulnerability because it makes the system susceptible to brute-force attacks and other security breaches. An attacker can easily guess the password or use automated tools to try common passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms and salting.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Avoid
