VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates proper usage of a mutex for protecting shared resources. It acquires the mutex using `pthread_mutex_lock()` before accessing the shared resource and releases it using `pthread_mutex_unlock()` afterwards. This ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
