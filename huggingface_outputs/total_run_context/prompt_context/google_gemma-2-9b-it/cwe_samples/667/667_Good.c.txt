EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates proper usage of a mutex lock. It acquires the lock using `pthread_mutex_lock()` and checks for errors. If successful, it proceeds to access the shared resource. Finally, it releases the lock using `pthread_mutex_unlock()`. This pattern ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.
