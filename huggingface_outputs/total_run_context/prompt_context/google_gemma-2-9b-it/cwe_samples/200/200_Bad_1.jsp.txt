VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information. If the `debugEnabled` flag is set to true, the user's account number (`acctNo`) is directly exposed in the output. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Remove the debug flag:** If the debug flag is not essential, remove it entirely.
