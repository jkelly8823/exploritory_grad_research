VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3

The code directly exposes the username and password parameters to the script. This is a security vulnerability because an attacker could potentially intercept these values during transmission.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method for transmitting sensitive information, such as HTTPS.
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Store passwords securely using hashing and salting.
