VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes the encryption context using a predictable initialization vector (IV) by setting it to all zeros. This is a known vulnerability (CWE-329) as it allows attackers to perform dictionary attacks against the encrypted data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation.
- Avoid using a fixed or predictable
