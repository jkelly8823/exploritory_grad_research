VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not properly validate the length of the `msg->msgBody` array before copying it into the `message` array. If `msg->msgLength` is greater than `MESSAGE_SIZE`, the code will write beyond the bounds of the `message` array, leading to a buffer overflow.
