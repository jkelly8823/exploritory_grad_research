VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8,9
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the `strncpy` function to copy data from command-line arguments (`argv[1]` and `argv[2]`) into the `Filename` and `Pattern` buffers respectively.  The issue lies in the potential for buffer overflows.

`strncpy` does not automatically null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string is longer than the buffer size.
