VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates safe buffer handling practices. 

* `strncpy` is used instead of `strcpy`, which prevents buffer overflows by limiting the number of characters copied.
* The `sizeof(Filename)-1` and `sizeof(Pattern)-1` arguments passed to `strncpy` ensure that the copied string length is less than the buffer size, leaving space for the null terminator.
