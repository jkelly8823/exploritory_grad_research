VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates a classic race condition vulnerability.  Signal handlers like `sh` are executed asynchronously, meaning they can be triggered at any time without regard to the normal flow of the program.

In this case, the `sh` handler attempts to free memory pointed to by `global1` and `global2`. However, the `main` function also uses these
