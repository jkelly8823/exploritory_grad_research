VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code exhibits a classic race condition vulnerability. The shared variable `foo` is accessed and modified by both the main thread and the `Threader` thread concurrently. 

1. The main thread sets `foo` to 1.
2. Before the main thread completes, the `Threader` thread starts and attempts to read the value of `foo`.
