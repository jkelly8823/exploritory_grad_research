VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code exhibits a classic race condition vulnerability. The `foo` variable is shared between multiple threads, and the `storenum` function updates it without any synchronization mechanisms.

When two threads call `storenum` concurrently, both threads might read the current value of `foo`, increment their local `counter`, and then write the updated value back to `foo`. This can lead to a
