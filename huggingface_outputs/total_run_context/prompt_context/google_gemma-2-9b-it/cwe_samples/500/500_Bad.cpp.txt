VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a public static string variable `appPropertiesConfigFile`.  Since it is not declared as `final`, its value can be modified after initialization. This opens the possibility of unexpected behavior if the value is changed by another part of the code or by external actors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Declare the variable as `final` to prevent its value from being changed after initialization.
