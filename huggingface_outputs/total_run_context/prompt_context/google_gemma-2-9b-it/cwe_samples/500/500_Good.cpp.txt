VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares a public static constant string.  In C++, constants are immutable by design, meaning their value cannot be changed after initialization.  Therefore, even though the field is not marked `final`, it cannot be modified unexpectedly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
