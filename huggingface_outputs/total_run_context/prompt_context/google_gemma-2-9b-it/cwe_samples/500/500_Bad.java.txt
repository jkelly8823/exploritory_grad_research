VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a public static String variable `appPropertiesFile`.  Since it is not declared as `final`, its value can be modified after initialization. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities if the value is used in sensitive operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Declare the variable as `final` to prevent any modifications after initialization:

```java
public class SomeAppClass
