EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks. The `System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile")` method retrieves a filename from a system property. An attacker could potentially set this property to a malicious path, such as "/abs/path/to/sensitive_file", allowing them to access files outside the intended directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize
