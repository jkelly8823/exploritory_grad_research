VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8,9,10
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to race conditions.  The `print` function is designed to process a string character by character.  However, the code lacks any synchronization mechanisms to protect shared resources (specifically, the `stdout` stream and potentially the `string` itself) when accessed concurrently by multiple processes (the parent and child processes).
