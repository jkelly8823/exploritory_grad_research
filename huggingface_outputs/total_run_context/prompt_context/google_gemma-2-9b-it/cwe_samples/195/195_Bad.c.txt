VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to CWE-195. The function `readdata()` uses a signed integer (`int`) to store the `amount` variable. However, it later casts this signed integer to an unsigned integer (`unsigned int`) before returning it.

If the `result` variable evaluates to `ERROR`, the `amount` variable is set to -1
