VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
Line 5: `short len = *(short*) strm;`

The code casts a pointer `strm` to a `short*` and then dereferences it to read a value. This assumes that the data pointed to by `strm` is a valid `short` value. If the data is not a valid `short`, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
