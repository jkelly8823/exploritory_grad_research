VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-807 because it relies on the `gethostbyaddr` function to verify the hostname. An attacker could manipulate the `ip_addr_string` input to resolve to a different hostname than "trustme.example.com", bypassing the intended protection mechanism.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust hostname verification method, such as DNSSEC
