VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-807 because the `getRemoteAddr()` method can be spoofed by an attacker. An attacker can modify the IP address they send in the request, allowing them to bypass the trust check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more reliable method for determining the user's trust level, such as verifying a trusted certificate or using a secure authentication mechanism
