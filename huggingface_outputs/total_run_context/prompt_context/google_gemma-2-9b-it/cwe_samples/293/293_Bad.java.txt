VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5,6,7
EXPLANATION:
The code relies on the `referer` header for authorization, which is a known vulnerability (CWE-293). The `referer` header can be easily manipulated by attackers, making it an unreliable mechanism for security checks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a more robust authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to verify user identity and permissions.
-
