VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE_687 (Use After Free).  The code demonstrates a function `PrivilegedFunc` that calls `CheckAuth` to verify authentication. If authentication succeeds, it proceeds to call `ReportAuth` to log the authentication result.  The `ReportAuth` function then checks the result and only terminates the program (`die`)
