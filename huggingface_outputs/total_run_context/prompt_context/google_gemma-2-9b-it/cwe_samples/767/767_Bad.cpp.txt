VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a private member variable `price` and a public method `changePrice`. This method allows external code to directly modify the private variable `price`. This violates encapsulation principles and can lead to unintended consequences.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider making the `price` variable protected instead of private. This would allow access to the variable within the same package or class hierarchy.
- Alternatively
