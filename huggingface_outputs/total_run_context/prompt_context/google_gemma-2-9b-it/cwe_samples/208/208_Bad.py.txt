VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5,7
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential timing attack vulnerability (CWE-208). 

The `for` loop iterates through the length of the password. The time taken to execute this loop will vary depending on the password length. An attacker could observe the execution time and potentially deduce the length of the password, which could be used to gain further information about the password
