VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not demonstrate a vulnerability related to custom error pages. The code handles exceptions using a try-catch block and logs the error message. It does not directly expose any sensitive information through error handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
While not directly vulnerable, it's good practice to implement custom error pages for a better user experience and to potentially mask sensitive information in error messages.
