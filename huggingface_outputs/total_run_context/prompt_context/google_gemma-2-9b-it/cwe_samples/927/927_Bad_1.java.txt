EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses an implicit intent (`intent.setAction("com.example.service.UserExists")`) to broadcast a message containing sensitive user data ("Username"). Implicit intents can be received by any component (Activity, Service, BroadcastReceiver) that declares an appropriate intent filter. This poses a security risk as malicious applications could potentially intercept and access the sensitive user data.
