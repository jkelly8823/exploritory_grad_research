VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses "RSA/NONE/NoPadding" for encryption, which means it does not use Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP). This makes the encryption vulnerable to attacks like Bleichenbacher's attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use OAEP padding instead of NoPadding. For example, use "RSA/OAEPWithSHA256AndMGF1Padding" for encryption
