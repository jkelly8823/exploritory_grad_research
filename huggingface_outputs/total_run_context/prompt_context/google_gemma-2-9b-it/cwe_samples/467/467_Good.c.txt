VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not exhibit the vulnerability described in CWE_ID 467. The `sizeof(*foo)` correctly calculates the size of a single `double` element.  The `malloc()` function is then called with the appropriate size to allocate memory for a single `double`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
