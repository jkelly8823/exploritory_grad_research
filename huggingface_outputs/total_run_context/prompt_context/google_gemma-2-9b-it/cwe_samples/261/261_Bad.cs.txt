VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code decodes a password from a Base64 string. While Base64 encoding is a common way to represent binary data, it is a reversible process and does not provide strong security for passwords. An attacker could easily decode the Base64 string and obtain the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to store
