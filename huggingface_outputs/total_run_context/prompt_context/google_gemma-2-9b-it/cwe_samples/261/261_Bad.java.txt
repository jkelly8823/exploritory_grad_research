VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code decodes a password from a configuration file using Base64 encoding. While Base64 encoding is a common technique, it is considered a weak form of encryption and does not adequately protect sensitive information like passwords. An attacker with access to the configuration file could easily decode the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2.
