VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic integer overflow vulnerability.  The variable `i` is initialized to the minimum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer (-2147483648). Subtracting 1 from this value results in -2147483649, which is outside the valid range of representable integers.
