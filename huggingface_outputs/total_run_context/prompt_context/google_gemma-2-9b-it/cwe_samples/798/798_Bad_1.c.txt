VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code directly stores the password "68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b" in plain text within the `strcmp` function. This is a severe vulnerability as it exposes the password in the source code, making it easily accessible to anyone who has access to the codebase.
