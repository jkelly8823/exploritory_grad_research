VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains hard-coded credentials in the form of the password "Mew!". This directly exposes the password within the source code, making it vulnerable to attackers who gain access to the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Do not hard-code credentials directly into the code.** Instead, use environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management system to store and retrieve sensitive information
