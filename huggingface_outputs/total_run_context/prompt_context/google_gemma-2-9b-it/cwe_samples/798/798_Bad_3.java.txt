VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains hard-coded credentials, "secretUsername" and "secretPassword", which are directly embedded in the resource bundle file. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive information within the application's source code or configuration files, making it vulnerable to attackers who gain access to these files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Use environment variables:** Store credentials in environment variables
