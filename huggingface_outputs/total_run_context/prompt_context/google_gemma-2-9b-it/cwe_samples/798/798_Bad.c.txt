VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains hard-coded credentials in the form of the password "Mew!". This directly exposes the password within the source code, making it vulnerable to attackers who gain access to the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Do not hard-code credentials directly into the code.** Instead, store them securely using environment variables, configuration files, or a dedicated secrets management system.
