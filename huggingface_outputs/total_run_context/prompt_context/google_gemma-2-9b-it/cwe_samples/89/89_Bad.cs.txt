VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input (`userName` and `ItemName.Text`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker could manipulate these inputs to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This
