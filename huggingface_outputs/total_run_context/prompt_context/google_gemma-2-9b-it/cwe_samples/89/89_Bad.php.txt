VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts the value of the `$_COOKIE["mid"]` variable into the SQL query without any sanitization or escaping. An attacker could manipulate the value of this cookie to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
