VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12,13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it copies data from `msg->msgBody` into the `message` array without checking if `msg->msgLength` is greater than `MESSAGE_SIZE`. If `msg->msgLength` exceeds `MESSAGE_SIZE`, the code will write beyond the bounds of the `message` array, leading to a buffer overflow
