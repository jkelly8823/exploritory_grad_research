EXPLANATION:
The code snippet sets a cookie named "session_id" to store a generated session ID.  The absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on the cookie makes it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could potentially steal the session ID through malicious JavaScript code running in the user's browser, allowing them to impersonate the user.
