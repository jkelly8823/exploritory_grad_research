VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to session hijacking. While it checks for the existence of a "username" session variable, it doesn't verify the integrity or authenticity of the session. An attacker could potentially manipulate the session ID to gain unauthorized access, even if the "username" session variable exists.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement session fixation prevention techniques
