VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability (CWE-134). The `printWrapper` function uses `printf` with a format string taken directly from the user-supplied input (`argv[1]`). This allows an attacker to craft malicious input that can be interpreted as format specifiers, potentially leading to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.
