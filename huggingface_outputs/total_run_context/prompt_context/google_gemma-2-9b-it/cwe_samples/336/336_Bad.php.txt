VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `srand($userID)` to seed the random number generator. However, if `$userID` is predictable or reused, the same seed will be used repeatedly, resulting in the generation of the same "random" session IDs. This violates the principle of unpredictability essential for secure session management.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPR
