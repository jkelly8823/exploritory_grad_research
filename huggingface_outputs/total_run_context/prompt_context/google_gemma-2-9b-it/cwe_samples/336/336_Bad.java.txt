VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a fixed seed value (1234567890) for the Random object. This means that the generated random numbers will always be the same, as the PRNG will start from the same initial state each time. This makes the generated account IDs predictable and vulnerable to attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust random number generator, such as
