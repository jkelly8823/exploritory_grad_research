VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `numHeaders` is assigned the value of `packet->headers`, which is likely an integer representing the number of headers in the packet. If `packet->headers` exceeds the maximum value an integer can hold, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as buffer overflows or crashes.
