VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3,4,5,6
EXPLANATION:
The `PatientRecord` class does not have any explicit serialization protection. This means that an attacker could potentially serialize an instance of this class and extract the sensitive data (`name` and `socialSecurityNum`). This vulnerability is particularly concerning because the `PatientRecord` class is accessible from other classes, allowing for potential exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement serialization
