VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to authorization. While it includes a check for authentication using `AuthenticateUser`, it lacks any explicit authorization check before accessing and displaying the private message.

An authenticated user might not necessarily be authorized to view a specific private message. The code assumes that if a user is authenticated, they have access to all private messages, which is a security risk.
