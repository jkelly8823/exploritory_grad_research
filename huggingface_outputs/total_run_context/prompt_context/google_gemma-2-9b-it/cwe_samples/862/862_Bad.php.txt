VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-862 (Authorization Failure) because it allows unauthenticated access to the `runEmployeeQuery` function. 

The function retrieves employee data based on the `EmployeeName` parameter passed through the `$_GET` superglobal.  An attacker could manipulate the `EmployeeName` parameter to access sensitive employee information without any authorization checks.
