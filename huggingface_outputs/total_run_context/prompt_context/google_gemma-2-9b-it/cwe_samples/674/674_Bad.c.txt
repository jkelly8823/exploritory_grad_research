VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The provided code demonstrates a classic example of a stack overflow vulnerability due to unchecked recursion. The `do_something_recursive` function calls itself repeatedly with the same value of `flg`. Since `flg` is never modified within the function, the recursive call condition (`if (flg)`) will always be true. This leads to an infinite recursion, consuming more and more stack space until the
