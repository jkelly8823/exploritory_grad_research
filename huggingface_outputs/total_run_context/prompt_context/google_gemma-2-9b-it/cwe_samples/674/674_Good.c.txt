VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential for a stack overflow vulnerability due to unchecked recursion. The `do_something_recursive` function calls itself repeatedly as long as the `flg` variable is non-zero.  If `flg` is not modified correctly within the function, or if there's a condition that prevents it from eventually becoming zero, the recursion will continue indefinitely. This can
