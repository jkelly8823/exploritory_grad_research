VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a `Random` object with a seed based on the current time. This means that the generated random numbers will be deterministic and predictable if the same time is encountered again. An attacker could potentially predict the generated receipt URLs and access sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) instead of the default `Random` class
