VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap overflow because it uses `alloca` to allocate memory on the stack without properly checking the available stack space.  The `alloca` function allocates memory on the stack, which has a limited size. If the number of objects (`end_limit`) is large enough, the stack may overflow, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
