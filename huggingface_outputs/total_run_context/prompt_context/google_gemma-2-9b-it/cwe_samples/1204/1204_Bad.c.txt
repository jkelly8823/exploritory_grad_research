VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes a cipher context using the `EVP_bf_cbc()` cipher, which requires a unique and unpredictable Initialization Vector (IV). However, the code sets the IV to all zeros using `memset(iv,0,EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH)`. This is a major security vulnerability because using a predictable IV allows an attacker to decrypt the ciphertext using known plaintext attacks.
