VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a static Initialization Vector (IV) of all zeros. This is a severe vulnerability as it allows attackers to easily decrypt the ciphertext.  An attacker can predict the plaintext by knowing the IV and the encryption algorithm.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Generate a new, random IV for each encryption operation. 
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG
