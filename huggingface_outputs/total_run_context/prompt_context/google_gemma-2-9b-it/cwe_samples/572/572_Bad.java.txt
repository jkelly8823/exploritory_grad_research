VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code creates a new Thread object and defines its run() method. However, instead of calling the start() method, it directly calls the run() method. This is a vulnerability because it executes the thread's code within the context of the calling thread, bypassing the intended multi-threading behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change `thr.run();` to `thr.start();`
