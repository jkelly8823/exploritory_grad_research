VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any characteristics related to the CWE-1255 vulnerability. The code implements a simple D flip-flop circuit, which simply latches the input value 'a' onto the output 'q' when the clock signal 'clk' transitions from low to high. There is no mechanism for monitoring power consumption or using it to infer the value of a security token
