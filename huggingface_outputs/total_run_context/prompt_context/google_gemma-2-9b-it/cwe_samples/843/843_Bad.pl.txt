VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not exhibit the vulnerability described in CWE_843. The code snippet compares a string ("user") with an array (`$UserPrivilegeArray`).  The comparison operator (`eq`) is designed to compare strings, and the code does not attempt to access the array elements using incompatible types.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
