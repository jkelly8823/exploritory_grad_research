VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code does not have a mechanism to free the allocated memory using `free(buf)` after it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, where the allocated memory is not released back to the system, eventually consuming all available memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add `free(buf)` after the `return buf;` statement to release the allocated memory when the function finishes
