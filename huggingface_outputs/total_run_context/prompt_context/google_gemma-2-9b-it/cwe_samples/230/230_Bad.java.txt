VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-230 because it does not handle the case where the "URLToOpen" extra is missing from the intent. If the intent does not contain this extra, `intent.getStringExtra("URLToOpen")` will return null, and the subsequent code will attempt to access the length of a null string, leading to a NullPointerException.
