VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
EXPLANATION:
The code constructs a file path by concatenating the constant `UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING` with the extracted filename.  There is no validation or sanitization of the filename before it is used in the file path. An attacker could potentially provide a filename containing ".." sequences, which could allow them to write files outside of the intended `UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING`.
