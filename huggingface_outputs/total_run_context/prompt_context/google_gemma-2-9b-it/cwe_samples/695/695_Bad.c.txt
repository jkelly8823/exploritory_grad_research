VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `gets()` function to read input from the user. `gets()` is a dangerous function because it does not check the length of the input, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.
