VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the size of the buffer `buf` is calculated based on the untrusted input `jnklen`. If `jnklen` is larger than `pre_len - sizeof("preamble: ")`, a buffer overflow will occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safe string library that handles buffer overflows automatically.
- Validate the input `
