VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it uses an untrusted input (`$num`) to determine the size of the array `@messages`. If `$num` is larger than the expected size, it will cause an overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the input `$num` to ensure it is within
