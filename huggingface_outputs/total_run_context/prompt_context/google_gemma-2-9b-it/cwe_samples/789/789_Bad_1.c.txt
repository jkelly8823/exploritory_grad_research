VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the size of the buffer `buf` is determined by the difference between `a` and `b`. If `a` is significantly larger than `b`, `len` will be a large positive value, leading to a buffer that is too big to fit on the stack. This can cause a buffer overflow when data is written to `buf
