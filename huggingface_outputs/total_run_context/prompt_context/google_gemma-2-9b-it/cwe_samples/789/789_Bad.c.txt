VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it allocates memory based on the untrusted input `GetUntrustedInt()`.  If `GetUntrustedInt()` returns a value larger than the maximum allowed size for the buffer, `malloc()` will allocate more memory than intended. This can lead to a buffer overflow when `InitializeString()` attempts to write data to the allocated memory.
