VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it directly uses an untrusted input (`GetUntrustedInt()`) to determine the size of a new HashMap. If `GetUntrustedInt()` returns a value larger than the expected maximum size for a HashMap, it can lead to an allocation of excessive memory, potentially causing a buffer overflow or denial of service.
