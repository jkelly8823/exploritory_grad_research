VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the size of the buffer `buf` is calculated based on the untrusted input `jnklen`. If `jnklen` is larger than `pre_len - sizeof("preamble: ")`, a buffer overflow will occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safe string library function to calculate the length of the string
