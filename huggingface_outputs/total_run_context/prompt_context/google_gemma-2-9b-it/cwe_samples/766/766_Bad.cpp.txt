VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code declares a member variable named "password" as public. This means that the variable can be accessed and modified from outside the class, which is a security risk. In most cases, passwords should be stored privately to prevent unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the access modifier of the "password" variable to private:

```c++
private:
char* password;
