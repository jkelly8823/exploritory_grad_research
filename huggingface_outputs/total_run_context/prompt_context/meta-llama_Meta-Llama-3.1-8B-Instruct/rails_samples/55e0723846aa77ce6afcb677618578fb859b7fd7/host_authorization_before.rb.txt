 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the improper handling of Host headers. The `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape the host string, but it does not account for the possibility of a malicious host string that contains special characters. This allows an attacker to craft a Host header that can redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust method to escape the host string, such as `URI::Escape.escape`.
- Validate the host string to ensure it only contains valid characters.
- Consider using a whitelist approach to define allowed hosts, rather than relying on regular expressions. This can help prevent open redirect vulnerabilities. ```ruby
if host.start_with?(".")
  /\A(.+\.)?#{URI::Escape.escape(host[1..-1])}\z/i
else
  /\A#{URI::Escape.escape(host)}\z/i
end
``` ```ruby
allowed_hosts = ["example.com", "sub.example.com"]
if allowed_hosts.include?(host)
  # allow the request
else
  # deny the request
end
``` ```ruby
config.hosts = ["example.com",
