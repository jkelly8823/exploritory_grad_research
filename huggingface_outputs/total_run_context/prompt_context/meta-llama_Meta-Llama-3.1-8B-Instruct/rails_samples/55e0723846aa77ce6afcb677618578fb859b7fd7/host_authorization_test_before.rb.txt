 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the open redirect vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22903. The line `assert_match "Blocked host: attacker.com#x.example.com", response.body` is attempting to test for a specific host header value, which is a potential entry point for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability. Additionally, the line `ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization.new(App, "example.com", ->(env) { true })` is creating a new instance of the HostAuthorization middleware, which is deprecated and may be a potential security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Actionpack gem to version 6.1.3.2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Remove the deprecated code and replace it with the recommended alternative.
3. Ensure that all host headers are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential attacks.  ```
