 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the improper escaping of the host header. The `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape special characters in the host header, but it does not account for the possibility of a malicious host header that contains a dot (.) followed by a valid domain name. This allows an attacker to bypass the Host Authorization middleware and redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust method to escape the host header, such as `URI::regexp` or a dedicated library like `rack-rewrite`.
- Validate the host header against a whitelist of allowed domains to prevent open redirects.
- Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate configuration file or environment variable to store allowed hosts, rather than relying on a hardcoded list in the code.  ```ruby
          if host.start_with?(".")
            URI::regexp(host[1..-1])
          else
            URI::regexp(host)
          end
        end
    end
