 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22903 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the `ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization` class without properly escaping the host headers. The `config.hosts` setting is not being used correctly, which allows for a malicious website to be redirected to. The `assert_match` statements in the code are testing for the presence of certain host headers, but they are not properly configured to prevent an open redirect vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `Actionpack` gem to version 6.1.3.2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Ensure that the `config.hosts` setting is properly configured to prevent open redirects.
3. Use a more secure method to validate host headers, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts. 
4. Remove the deprecated `action_dispatch.hosts_response_app` setting and use a more secure alternative. 
5. Review the code to ensure that it is properly configured to prevent open redirects.  ```python
