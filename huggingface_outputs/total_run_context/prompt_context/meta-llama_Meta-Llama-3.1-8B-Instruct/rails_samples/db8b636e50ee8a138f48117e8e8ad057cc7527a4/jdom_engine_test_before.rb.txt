 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an XML expansion attack. This is because the XmlMini.backend is set to 'JDOM', which is a vulnerable backend. The attack_xml variable contains a malicious XML payload that can cause the XML parser to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the XmlMini.backend to a secure backend, such as 'Nokogiri'.
2. Validate the XML input to prevent expansion attacks.
3. Use a secure XML parser, such as Nokogiri, to parse the XML data. 
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1856
CVE Description:
The ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM backend in lib/active_support/xml_mini/jdom.rb in the Active Support component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x and 3.1.x before 3.1.12 and 3.2.x before 3.2.13, when JRuby is used, does not properly restrict the capabilities of the XML parser, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via vectors involving (1
