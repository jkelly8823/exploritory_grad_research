 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This is because the DocumentBuilderFactory is not configured to prevent external entity expansion. An attacker could inject malicious XML that references an external entity, which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Configure the DocumentBuilderFactory to prevent external entity expansion by setting the feature "http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/feature/secureProcessing" to true. Additionally, consider using a more secure XML parser, such as Xerces. Also, validate the input XML to prevent any malicious XML from being parsed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1856
CVE Description: 
The ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM backend in lib/active_support/xml_mini/jdom.rb in the Active Support component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x and 3.1.x before 3.1.12 and 3.2.x before 3.2.13, when JRuby is used, does not properly restrict the capabilities of the XML parser, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service
