 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to implement a constant-time string comparison using the secure_compare method. This method is designed to prevent timing attacks by ensuring that the comparison takes the same amount of time regardless of the input. The variable_size_secure_compare method uses this secure_compare method to compare strings of variable lengths. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2015-7576 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the CVE-2015-7576 vulnerability. However, it's worth noting that the secure_compare method is not used in the provided code sample, but rather in the variable_size_secure_compare method. If the secure_compare method were to be used directly in the code, it would be beneficial to ensure that it is called with the correct arguments to prevent any potential issues.  The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2015-7576 vulnerability.
