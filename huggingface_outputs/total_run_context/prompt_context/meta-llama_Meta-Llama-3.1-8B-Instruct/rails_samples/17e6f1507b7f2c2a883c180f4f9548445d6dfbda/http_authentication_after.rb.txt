 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to timing attacks due to the use of the `&` operator in the comparison of the provided credentials with the stored credentials. The `&` operator short-circuits as soon as it encounters a false value, which can leak information about the length of the stored credentials. This can be exploited by an attacker to determine the length of the stored credentials, making it easier to bypass authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `&` operator with a constant-time comparison method, such as `ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.constant_time_compare`.
2. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as a password hashing library like bcrypt.
