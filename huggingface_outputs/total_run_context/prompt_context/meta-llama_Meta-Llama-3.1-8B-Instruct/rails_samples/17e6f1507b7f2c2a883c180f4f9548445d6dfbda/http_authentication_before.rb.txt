 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to timing attacks due to the use of the '==' operator for password comparison. This operator can be slow for large strings, allowing an attacker to measure the time it takes to authenticate and potentially gain access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a constant-time comparison function, such as `Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(name + password)` to compare the passwords. This will ensure that the comparison takes the same amount of time regardless of the input, preventing timing attacks. Alternatively, you can use a library like `bcrypt` or `argon2` that is designed to be resistant to timing attacks.
