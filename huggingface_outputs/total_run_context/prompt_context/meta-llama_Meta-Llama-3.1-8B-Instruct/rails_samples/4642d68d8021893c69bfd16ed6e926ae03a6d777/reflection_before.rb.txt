 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is using class attributes to define the _reflections and aggregate_reflections, which is not related to the instance-level writers for class accessors that are vulnerable to the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to class accessors or instance-level writers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-0753
CVE Description:
Active Model in Ruby on Rails 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 supports the use of instance-level writers for class accessors, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters.  This vulnerability is related to the use of `attr_accessor` and `attr_writer` in the code. 

Code Sample:
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      attr_accessor :name
      attr_writer :name
    end
