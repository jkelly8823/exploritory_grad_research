 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it uses instance-level writers for class accessors. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. Specifically, the code uses the `mattr_accessor` method to define a class attribute, which can be used to set instance-level writers for class accessors. This is a known vulnerability in Ruby on Rails 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Ruby on Rails to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753, such as 4.1.14.1 or later, 4.2.5.1 or later, or 5.0.0.beta1.1 or later.
2. Avoid using instance-level writers for class accessors in your code. Instead, use class-level writers or other secure methods to set class attributes.
3. Consider using a security audit tool to scan your code for other potential
