 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it uses instance-level writers for class accessors. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. Specifically, the line `private :validation_context=` makes the `validation_context=` method private, but the class attribute `:validation_context` is still accessible. This can be exploited by an attacker to bypass validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `private :validation_context=` line to make the `validation_context=` method public.
2. Use a different approach to validate the `validation_context` attribute, such as using a public method or a separate validation mechanism.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to define class attributes, such as using a module or a separate class. 
4. Update the code to use the latest version of Ruby on Rails to ensure that the vulnerability is patched. 
5. Consider using a security framework or library to help identify and prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
