 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The class attributes are defined with instance_writer set to false, which prevents instance-level writers from being used for class accessors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure.  The instance_writer option is set to false for both class attributes, which prevents instance-level writers from being used for class accessors. This aligns with the recommended fix for the CVE, which is to set instance_writer to false for class attributes.  However, since this is already done in the code, no further action is required.
