 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The class attributes are defined with instance_writer: false, which means that they cannot be modified at the instance level. This aligns with the recommended mitigation for the CVE, which is to set instance_writer to false for the class attribute.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is already secure. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that all class attributes are properly configured to prevent instance-level modification. This can be achieved by setting instance_writer to false for all class attributes that should not be modifiable at the instance level.  ```ruby
class_attribute :default_scopes, instance_writer: false, instance_predicate: false
class_attribute :default_scope_override, instance_writer: false, instance_predicate: false
```
