 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it uses instance_writer: false for the class attribute :include_root_in_json. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use class_writer: true instead of instance_writer: false to prevent this vulnerability. The corrected code should look like this: class_attribute :include_root_in_json, class_writer: true. This will ensure that the class attribute is properly set and validated.  Additionally, ensure that the validation steps are properly implemented to prevent bypassing.  Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a hash to store configuration options, to further mitigate this vulnerability.  Always validate user input to prevent potential attacks.  Consider using a library like Rails' built-in `strong_parameters` to help with parameter validation.  Regularly review and update your code to ensure it remains secure.  Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Always follow secure coding practices and guidelines.  Consider using a secure coding standard, such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices, to guide your coding decisions.  Always test your code thoroughly to ensure it is
