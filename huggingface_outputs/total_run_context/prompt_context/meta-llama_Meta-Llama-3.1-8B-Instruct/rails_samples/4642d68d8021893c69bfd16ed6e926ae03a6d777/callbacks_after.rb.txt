 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it uses instance-level writers for class accessors. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. Specifically, the line `mattr_accessor(:halt_and_display_warning_on_return_false, instance_writer: false) { true }` is the culprit, as it sets the `instance_writer` option to `false` for the `halt_and_display_warning_on_return_false` class attribute. This allows an attacker to modify the attribute at the instance level, bypassing the intended validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `instance_writer: false` option from the `mattr_accessor` call to prevent instance-level writers from being used for class accessors.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate method to set the `halt_and_display_warning_on_return_false` attribute, rather than relying on a class accessor. This would prevent the attribute from being modified at the instance level. 
3. Update the code to use a more secure version of Ruby on Rails, such as 4.1.14.1 or later, which addresses this vulnerability.
