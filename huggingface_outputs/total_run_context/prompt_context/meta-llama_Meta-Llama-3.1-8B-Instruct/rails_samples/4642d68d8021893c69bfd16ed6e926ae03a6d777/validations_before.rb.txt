 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it uses instance-level writers for class accessors. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. Specifically, the line `self._validators = Hash.new { |h,k| h[k] = [] }` creates a class attribute that can be manipulated by an attacker to bypass validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Ruby on Rails to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 (e.g., 4.1.14.1 or later, 4.2.5.1 or later, or 5.0.0.beta1.1 or later).
2. Remove the use of instance-level writers for class accessors by using a different approach to implement validation.
3. Implement additional validation checks to prevent attackers from bypassing intended validation steps. 
4. Consider using a secure validation library or framework that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```
