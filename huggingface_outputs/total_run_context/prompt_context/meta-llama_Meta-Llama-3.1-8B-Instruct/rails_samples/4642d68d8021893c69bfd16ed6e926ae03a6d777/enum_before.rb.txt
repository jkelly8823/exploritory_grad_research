 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it allows instance-level writers for class accessors. This can be exploited by remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. The vulnerability is present in the `inherited` method where it does not properly validate the `base` parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `base` parameter in the `inherited` method to ensure it is a subclass of the current class.
2. Use a secure method to set class attributes, such as using `class_attribute` with the `:writer` option set to `false`.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to define class accessors, such as using a separate module or class for this purpose.
