 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it uses instance-level writers for class accessors. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. Specifically, the line `self.include_root_in_json = false` is the vulnerable line, as it uses the instance-level writer `include_root_in_json=` to set the class attribute `include_root_in_json`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use the class-level writer `include_root_in_json=` instead of the instance-level writer `include_root_in_json=`. This can be done by changing the line `self.include_root_in_json = false` to `self.class.include_root_in_json = false`. This will ensure that the class attribute is set correctly and the vulnerability is mitigated.
