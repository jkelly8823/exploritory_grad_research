 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-0753 because it allows instance-level writers for class accessors. This can be exploited by remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters. Specifically, the line `base.class_attribute(:defined_enums, instance_writer: false)` is intended to prevent instance-level writers, but it is overridden by the line `base.defined_enums = {}`, which creates an instance-level writer for the `defined_enums` attribute.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the line `base.defined_enums = {}` and ensure that all class accessors are defined with the `instance_writer: false` option. Additionally, consider using a more secure approach to define class accessors, such as using a separate module or class to manage the accessors.
