 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to a too permissive regular expression in the Token Authentication logic in Action Controller. The regular expression does not properly validate the authentication header, allowing an attacker to send a large header that can cause the application to timeout. This can lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Actionpack gem to version 6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, or 5.2.6 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement a more robust regular expression to validate the authentication header, such as using a maximum length limit or a more restrictive pattern.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth. 
4. Add a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse and DoS attacks. 
5. Monitor the application for any suspicious activity and adjust the security measures as needed.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
