 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5418 vulnerability. However, the description provided in the task is incorrect. The correct CVE ID is CVE-2019-5418, and the description is about a possible denial of service vulnerability in the Token Authentication logic in Action Controller due to a too permissive regular expression. The code sample does not contain the vulnerable code, but it is still vulnerable because it uses the `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` method which is impacted by the vulnerability. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the actionpack gem to version 6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, or 5.2.6 to fix the vulnerability.
- Avoid using the `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` method and instead use a more secure authentication mechanism. 
- If the `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` method is necessary, consider using a custom regular expression that is more restrictive than the default one.  ```ruby
# Replace the default regular expression with a more restrictive one
authenticate_or_request_with_http_token do |token,
