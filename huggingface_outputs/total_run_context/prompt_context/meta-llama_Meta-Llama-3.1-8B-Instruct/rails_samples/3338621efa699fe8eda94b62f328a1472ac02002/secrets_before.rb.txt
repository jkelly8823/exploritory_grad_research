 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of IO.binread and IO.binwrite. These methods can be slow and may reveal information about the contents of the file, which could be used to launch a timing attack. Additionally, the use of Dir.tmpdir and File.join to create a temporary file path may also be vulnerable to a path traversal attack if the input to these methods is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to read and write binary data, such as File.binread and File.binwrite.
2. Use a more secure method to create temporary file paths, such as Tempfile.new.
3. Consider using a secure encryption library, such as OpenSSL, to encrypt the contents of the file. 
4. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the encryption key, such as a secure key store or a secrets manager. 
5. Consider using a secure method to handle the temporary file, such as using a secure temporary file library, such as Tempfile. 
6. Use a secure method to handle the encryption of the contents of the file, such as using a secure encryption library, such
