 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability present in this code is related to the use of `Dir.tmpdir` which is not secure. `Dir.tmpdir` returns the system's default temporary directory, which can be vulnerable to attacks if not properly sanitized. In this case, the code is using `Dir.tmpdir` to create a temporary file, which can lead to a potential path traversal attack. This can be mitigated by using a more secure method to create a temporary file, such as `Tempfile.new`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `Dir.tmpdir` with `Tempfile.new` to create a temporary file.
2. Use a secure method to sanitize the temporary file path to prevent path traversal attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Insecure use of `Dir.tmpdir` for creating temporary files. 
2. Potential path traversal attack due to insecure use of `Dir.tmpdir`.  ```ruby
