 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `assert_equal` method with a string that includes a file path. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code by manipulating the file path. Additionally, the use of `assert_predicate` and `assert_equal` methods with a file object could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the file is not accessible.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to compare the file contents, such as using a hash or a secure comparison function.
2. Validate the file path before using it to prevent potential injection attacks.
3. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism to prevent DoS attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Potential injection attack through file path manipulation
2. Denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to inaccessible file
3. Missing key error due to incorrect key path or env key.  The key is not checked for existence before being used.  This could lead to a MissingKeyError being raised.  This is a potential security issue. 
4. Potential security issue due to the use of `
