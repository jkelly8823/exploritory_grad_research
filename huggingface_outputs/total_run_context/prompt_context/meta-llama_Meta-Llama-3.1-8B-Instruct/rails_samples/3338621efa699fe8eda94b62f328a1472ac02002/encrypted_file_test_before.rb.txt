 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of an empty string as a key. In the test "raise MissingKeyError when key is missing", the key_path and env_key are set to an empty string. This can lead to a situation where the key is not properly validated, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the encrypted file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the key is properly validated before using it to decrypt the file.
- Consider using a secure method to generate and store the encryption key.
- In the test, provide a valid key to avoid the MissingKeyError. For example, you can use a dummy key or a key generated specifically for testing purposes. 
- Consider adding input validation to ensure that the key is not empty or null before using it to decrypt the file. 
- Consider using a more secure encryption algorithm and key management practices to protect the encrypted file.  ```ruby
