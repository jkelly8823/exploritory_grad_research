 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of `Process.pid` in the file name generation. This can be exploited by an attacker to determine the timing of the encryption process, potentially leading to a security breach. Additionally, the use of `binwrite` and `binread` methods can be vulnerable to a potential data corruption issue if the file is not properly closed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to generate the file name, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).
2. Use the `write` method instead of `binwrite` and `binread` to avoid potential data corruption issues.
3. Consider using a more secure encryption method, such as AES, and ensure that the key is properly generated and stored securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Potential timing attack vulnerability due to the use of `Process.pid` in file name generation.
2. Potential data corruption issue due to the use of `binwrite` and `binread` methods. 
3. Insecure encryption method.  ```ruby
