 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. This is because the `render file` option allows rendering a raw file from an absolute path, which can be used to access security sensitive files in the file system. This can be exploited by an attacker who can provide a malicious path to the `render file` method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using the `:file` option with user input. Instead, use the `send_file` method, which is designed to handle file uploads and downloads securely. Additionally, you can use the `path` option to specify the path to the file, which can help prevent directory traversal attacks. For example:

```ruby
send_file "#{Rails.root}/public/404.html", type: "text/html"
```

This will render the file securely, without allowing directory traversal attacks.
