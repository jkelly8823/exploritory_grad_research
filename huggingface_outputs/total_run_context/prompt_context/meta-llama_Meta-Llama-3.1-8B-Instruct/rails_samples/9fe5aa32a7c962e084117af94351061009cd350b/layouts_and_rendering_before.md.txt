 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks because it uses the `render file:` option with an absolute file-system path. This allows an attacker to access security-sensitive files in the file system by providing a malicious file path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the `render` method with caution and avoid using the `:file` option with user-input data. Instead, use the `render` method with a template name or a symbol that references a template. If you need to render a file, use the `render file:` option with a path that is within the application's directory structure and not user-input. Additionally, consider using the `ActionController::Base.helpers` to sanitize the file path before rendering it.
