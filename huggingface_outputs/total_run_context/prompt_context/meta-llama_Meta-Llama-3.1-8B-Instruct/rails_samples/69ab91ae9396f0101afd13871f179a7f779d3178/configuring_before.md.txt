 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not directly contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, the code does contain methods and variables that could potentially be used in a way that would be vulnerable to this CVE if not properly configured or used. For example, if the `config.action_dispatch.encrypted_signed_cookie_salt` is not properly set, it could potentially allow an attacker to bypass intended database-query restrictions. Additionally, if the `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.before` or `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.to_prepare` blocks are not properly validated, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Ensure that the `config.action_dispatch.encrypted_signed_cookie_salt` is properly set and not easily guessable.
* Validate any user input passed to the `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.before` or `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.to_prepare` blocks to prevent code injection attacks.
* Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the `config.action_dispatch.encrypted_signed_cookie_salt` value. 
* Consider using a validation library to validate user input passed to the `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.before` or `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.to_prepare` blocks.  VULNERABILITY
