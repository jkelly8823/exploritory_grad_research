 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a Header Injection (and thus response splitting) attack. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle the "Connection" header, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious HTML. This is a serious bug that can be exploited to perform a response splitting attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Update your Rails version to 2.0.5 or 2.1.2 to eliminate Header Injection risks. Additionally, ensure that the "Connection" header is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0155
CVE Description: 
Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before 3.2.11 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request, as demonstrated by certain "[nil]" values, a related issue to CVE-
