 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155. The issue lies in the deep_munge method, specifically in the lines where it handles arrays and hashes. The method does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation, allowing an attacker to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request. The code attempts to remove nils from the params hash, but it does not account for the possibility of a crafted request containing "[nil]" values, which can lead to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the deep_munge method to properly handle arrays and hashes, ensuring that it does not allow crafted requests to bypass database-query restrictions.
2. Consider using a more robust parameter handling mechanism, such as the `permit` method provided by Rails, to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security standards.  ```ruby
