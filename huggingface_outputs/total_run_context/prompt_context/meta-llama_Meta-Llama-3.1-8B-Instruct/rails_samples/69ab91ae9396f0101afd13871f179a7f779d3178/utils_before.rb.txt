 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155. The deep_munge method does not properly handle nil values in the params hash, which can lead to bypassing intended database-query restrictions and performing NULL checks or triggering missing WHERE clauses. This is because the method does not remove nil values from the hash, and instead, it checks if the value is an empty array and sets the corresponding hash key to nil if it is. This can be exploited by sending a crafted request with nil values in the params hash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the deep_munge method to properly handle nil values in the params hash. This can be done by adding a check for nil values and removing them from the hash.
2. Consider using a more robust method for removing nil values from the params hash, such as using the `compact` method on the hash itself.
3. Ensure that the deep_munge method is properly tested to ensure that it handles nil values correctly.
