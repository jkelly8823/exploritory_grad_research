VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the "Unsafe Query Generation" vulnerability. The `deep_munge` method is not performed, which allows an attacker to bypass the test for `nil` and add `IS NULL` or `IN ('foo', NULL)` where clauses to the SQL query. This can be exploited by sending a crafted request with a JSON payload that contains a `null` value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should perform the `deep_munge` method on the `params` hash. You can do this by adding the following line of code before the vulnerable code:
```ruby
params.deep_munge!
```
Alternatively, you can configure your application to disable `deep_munge` if you are aware of the risk and know how to handle it:
```ruby
config.action_dispatch.perform_deep_munge = false
``` 
However, this is not recommended as it can lead to security
