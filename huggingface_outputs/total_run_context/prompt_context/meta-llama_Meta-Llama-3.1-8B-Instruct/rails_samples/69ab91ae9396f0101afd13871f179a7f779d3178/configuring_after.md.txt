 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not directly contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, the code does provide configuration options that could potentially be used to bypass intended database-query restrictions. For example, the `config.action_dispatch.perform_deep_munge` option can be set to `false` to prevent the `deep_munge` method from being performed on parameters, which could potentially allow an attacker to bypass intended database-query restrictions. Additionally, the `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.before` and `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.to_prepare` methods can be used to inject malicious code into the request, which could potentially be used to bypass intended database-query restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Ensure that `config.action_dispatch.perform_deep_munge` is set to `true` to prevent the `deep_munge` method from being performed on parameters.
* Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent malicious code from being injected into the request.
* Use a secure configuration for `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.before` and `ActionDispatch::Callbacks.to_prepare` to prevent malicious code from being injected into the request.
