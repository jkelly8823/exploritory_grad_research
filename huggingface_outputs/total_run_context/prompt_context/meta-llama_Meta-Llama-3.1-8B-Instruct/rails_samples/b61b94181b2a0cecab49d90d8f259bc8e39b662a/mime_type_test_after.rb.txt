 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine caused by carefully crafted Accept headers. This is because the Mime::Type.new method does not properly handle the parsing of the Accept header, which can lead to an infinite loop in the regular expression engine.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the Mime::Type.new method to properly handle the parsing of the Accept header.
- Use a more robust regular expression engine that is less susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.
- Implement a timeout mechanism to prevent the denial of service attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22902
CVE Description:
The actionpack ruby gem (a framework for handling and responding to web requests in Rails) before 6.0.3.7, 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible denial of service vulnerability in the Mime type parser of Action Dispatch. Carefully crafted Accept headers can cause the mime type parser in Action Dispatch to do catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine.  The code sample provided is a test case for this vulnerability.  The Mime::Type.new
