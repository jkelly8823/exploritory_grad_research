 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability due to the catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine caused by carefully crafted Accept headers. This is because the regular expression in the MIME_REGEXP variable does not properly handle the MIME parameters, allowing an attacker to cause the regular expression engine to do excessive backtracking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Actionpack gem to version 6.0.3.7 or later, or version 6.1.3.2 or later.
2. Use a more robust regular expression that properly handles the MIME parameters, such as one that uses possessive quantifiers or atomic grouping to prevent backtracking.
3. Implement a limit on the number of iterations of the regular expression engine to prevent denial of service attacks. 
4. Consider using a more secure method of parsing MIME types, such as using a dedicated library or module.
