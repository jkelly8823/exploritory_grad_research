 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability due to the catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine caused by carefully crafted Accept headers. This is because the regular expression in the MIME_REGEXP variable does not properly handle certain input cases, leading to a potential denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Actionpack gem to version 6.0.3.7 or later, or version 6.1.3.2 or later.
2. Use a more robust regular expression that properly handles input cases and prevents catastrophic backtracking.
3. Implement input validation to prevent malicious Accept headers from being processed. 
4. Consider using a more secure approach to parsing MIME types, such as using a dedicated library or module.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
