 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine caused by carefully crafted Accept headers. This is because the Mime::Type.new method does not properly handle nil values, which can lead to the regular expression engine getting stuck in an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add input validation to the Mime::Type.new method to ensure that it does not accept nil values.
- Consider using a more robust regular expression engine that is less prone to catastrophic backtracking.
- Update the Mime::Type parser to handle carefully crafted Accept headers in a way that prevents denial of service attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22902
CVE Description:
The actionpack ruby gem (a framework for handling and responding to web requests in Rails) before 6.0.3.7, 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible denial of service vulnerability in the Mime type parser of Action Dispatch. Carefully crafted Accept headers can cause the mime type parser in Action Dispatch to do catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine.  VULNERABLE: YES
