VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is using Sprockets version 3.7.1, which is affected by the CVE-2018-3760 vulnerability. This vulnerability allows specially crafted requests to access files outside the application's root directory when the Sprockets server is used in production. Since the code is using an affected version of Sprockets, it is vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade Sprockets to a version higher than 3.7.1, or use one of the workarounds provided by the Sprockets developers. This can be done by running `bundle update sprockets` in the terminal. Additionally, ensure that the Sprockets server is not used in production, or configure it to only serve files within the application's root directory.
