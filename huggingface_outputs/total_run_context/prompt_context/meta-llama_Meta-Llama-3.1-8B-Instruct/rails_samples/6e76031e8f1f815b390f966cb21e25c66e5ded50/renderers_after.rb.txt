 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks due to the improper restriction of the SWF file format. The use of a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content can satisfy the character-set requirements of a callback API, allowing an attacker to obtain sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input to prevent the execution of malicious SWF content.
2. Implement a proper validation mechanism to restrict the SWF file format.
3. Use a secure callback API that does not rely on the character-set requirements of the callback function. 
4. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be executed by the browser. 
5. Regularly update Adobe Flash Player and AIR to ensure you have the latest security patches. 
6. Consider using alternative technologies that do not rely on Flash, such as HTML5.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
