 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22885 because it does not properly sanitize user input when using the `redirect_to` or `polymorphic_url` helper. In the given code, the `record` variable is not checked for untrusted user input, which can lead to an information disclosure or unintended method execution vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the `record` variable by using a whitelist of allowed values or a sanitization library to ensure that only trusted input is passed to the `redirect_to` or `polymorphic_url` helper.
2. Use a secure method to handle untrusted user input, such as using a parameterized query or a prepared statement.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against this type of vulnerability, such as Rails' built-in `sanitize` method.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
