 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22885 vulnerability because it uses the `redirect_to` helper with untrusted user input in the `redirect_to_params` method. The `redirect_to` helper is called with an instance of `ActionController::Parameters` that contains user input, which is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, potentially leading to information disclosure or unintended method execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use the `redirect_to` helper with trusted input only.
- Sanitize user input before passing it to the `redirect_to` helper.
- Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input.
- Update to a version of Action Pack that is not vulnerable to this issue.
