 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22885 because it uses the `polymorphic_url` helper with untrusted user input in the `test_string_route_arguments` method. The `polymorphic_url` helper is not designed to handle arrays as arguments, and passing an array with untrusted user input can lead to an information disclosure or unintended method execution vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use the `polymorphic_url` helper with trusted user input only.
- Consider using a more secure alternative, such as `polymorphic_url` with a hash of trusted arguments.
- Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the `polymorphic_url` helper. 
- Update the code to use symbols for polymorphic route arguments, as shown in the `test_with_array_containing_symbols` method. 
- Consider using a more secure routing approach, such as using named routes or path helpers.  ```ruby
