 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22885 vulnerability because it uses the `redirect_to` helper with untrusted user input in the `test_with_array_containing_single_string_name` and `test_with_array_containing_symbols` methods. The `redirect_to` helper is used with the `assert_url` method, which takes an array of arguments, including untrusted user input. This could potentially lead to an information disclosure or unintended method execution vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the user input before passing it to the `redirect_to` helper.
2. Consider using a more secure method, such as `redirect_to` with a hash of options, to avoid passing untrusted user input directly.
3. Ensure that the `assert_url` method is properly secured to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  ```ruby
def test_with_array_containing_single_string_name
  with_test_routes do
    assert_url "http://example.com/projects", ["projects"].map(&:to_s)
  end
end

def test_with_array_containing_symbols
  with_test_routes do
    assert_url "http://example.com/
