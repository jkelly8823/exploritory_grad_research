 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure and unintended method execution due to the use of untrusted user input in the `redirect_to` method. Specifically, the `redirect_to` method is called with `nil` in the `redirect_to_nil` method, and with an instance of `Workshop` in the `redirect_to_polymorphic` and `redirect_to_polymorphic_string_args` methods. This can lead to information disclosure and unintended method execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input before passing it to the `redirect_to` method.
2. Use symbols for polymorphic route arguments instead of strings.
3. Avoid using `nil` as an argument to the `redirect_to` method. Instead, use a valid URL or path.
