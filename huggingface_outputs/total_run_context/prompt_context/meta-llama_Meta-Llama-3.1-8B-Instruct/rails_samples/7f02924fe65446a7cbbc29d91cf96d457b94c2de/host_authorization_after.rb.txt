 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the way it handles the `HTTP_HOST` and `x_forwarded_host` headers. The `VALID_ORIGIN_HOST` and `VALID_FORWARDED_HOST` regular expressions allow for hosts with a leading dot, which can be used to redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `VALID_ORIGIN_HOST` and `VALID_FORWARDED_HOST` regular expressions to exclude hosts with a leading dot.
2. Implement additional validation to ensure that the `HTTP_HOST` and `x_forwarded_host` headers are not tampered with.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle host validation, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.
