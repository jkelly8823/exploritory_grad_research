 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the open redirect vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22881. The `remote_ip` method is not properly validating the `Host` header, which can be used to redirect users to a malicious website. This is because the `env` hash is being merged with a new hash that includes the `action_dispatch.show_exceptions` and `action_dispatch.key_generator` keys, which can be used to bypass the Host Authorization middleware.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `Host` header in the `remote_ip` method to ensure it matches the expected format.
2. Remove the `action_dispatch.show_exceptions` and `action_dispatch.key_generator` keys from the `env` hash before merging it with the new hash.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to generating the `action_dispatch.key_generator` key, such as using a secure random number generator.
