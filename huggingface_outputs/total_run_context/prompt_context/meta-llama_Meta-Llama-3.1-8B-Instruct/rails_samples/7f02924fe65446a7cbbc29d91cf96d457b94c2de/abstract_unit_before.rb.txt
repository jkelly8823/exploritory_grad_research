 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the use of the `Rack::MockRequest.env_for` method to set the `HTTP_HOST` header. This method can be used to redirect users to a malicious website by setting a specially crafted `Host` header. The `assert_welcome` method is also vulnerable as it does not properly validate the response.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to set the `HTTP_HOST` header, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.
2. Validate the response in the `assert_welcome` method to ensure it is not a redirect to a malicious website.
