VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the open redirect vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22881. The `remote_ip` method is not properly validating the `HTTP_HOST` header, which can be used to redirect users to a malicious website. This is because the `action_dispatch.show_exceptions` and `action_dispatch.key_generator` are set to false and a caching key generator respectively, which can be used to bypass the validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `HTTP_HOST` header to ensure it matches the expected format.
2. Set `action_dispatch.show_exceptions` to true to enable exception handling.
3. Remove the caching key generator and use a secure method to generate keys. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to handle redirects, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.  ```ruby
    def remote_ip(env = {})
      remote_ip = nil
      env = Rack::MockRequest.env_for("/").merge(env).merge!(
        "HTTP_HOST" => "example.com",
        "action_dispatch.show_exceptions" => true,
        "action_dispatch.key_generator" => nil
      )
      #... rest of the code remains
