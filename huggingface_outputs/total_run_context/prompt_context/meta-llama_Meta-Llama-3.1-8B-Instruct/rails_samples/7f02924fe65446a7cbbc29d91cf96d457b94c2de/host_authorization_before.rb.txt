 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the way it handles the `HTTP_HOST` header. The regular expression used to validate the host name allows for a leading dot in the host name, which can be exploited to redirect users to a malicious website. This is a known vulnerability in the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the regular expression to not allow leading dots in the host name.
2. Consider using a more robust library for validating host names, such as `uri` or `netaddr`.
3. Implement additional validation for the `HTTP_HOST` header, such as checking for invalid characters or lengths.
