 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack. The middleware is configured to allow hosts with a leading dot, which can be exploited by a specially crafted `Host` header to redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Action Pack to version 6.1.2.1 or 6.0.3.5 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Configure the Host Authorization middleware to only allow hosts without a leading dot.
3. Use a more secure approach to handle host authorization, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts. 
4. Remove the deprecated `action_dispatch.hosts_response_app` configuration setting. 
5. Use a more secure approach to handle redirects, such as using a secure redirect method like `redirect_to` with a secure URL. 
6. Validate user input to prevent specially crafted `Host` headers. 
7. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 
8. Regularly update dependencies and libraries to ensure you have the latest security patches. 
9. Use a web application firewall (WAF
