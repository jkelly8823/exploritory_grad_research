 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the use of the `HOST` header in the `env` hash. This allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website by crafting a specially formatted `HOST` header. The `assert_match` statements in the code are attempting to verify that the correct error message is displayed when a blocked host is detected, but they do not account for the possibility of an attacker manipulating the `HOST` header.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `HOST` header from the `env` hash to prevent an attacker from manipulating it.
2. Use a more secure method to verify the host, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.
3. Update the code to account for the possibility of an attacker manipulating the `HOST` header, such as by using a more robust validation method.
