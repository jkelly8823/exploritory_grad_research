 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any direct references to the Host Authorization middleware or any code that could potentially be used to exploit the open redirect vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22881. However, the code does call the `@app.call` method which could potentially be used to make requests to external URLs. This could potentially be used to exploit the vulnerability if the `@app` object is not properly configured to prevent open redirects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the `@app` object is properly configured to prevent open redirects.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability, such as validating user input and sanitizing URLs.  ```ruby
    end

    def get(path)
      @app.call(::Rack::MockRequest.env_for(path))
    end

    def assert_welcome(resp)
      resp = Array(resp)
