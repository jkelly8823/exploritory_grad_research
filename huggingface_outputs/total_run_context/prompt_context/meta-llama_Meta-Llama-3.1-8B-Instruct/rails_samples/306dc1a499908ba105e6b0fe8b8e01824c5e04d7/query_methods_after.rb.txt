 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3514 because it allows remote attackers to bypass the strong parameters protection mechanism via crafted input to an application that makes create_with calls. This is due to the fact that the sanitize_forbidden_attributes method is not properly applied to the value parameter in the create_with! method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the sanitize_forbidden_attributes method to properly sanitize the value parameter in the create_with! method.
2. Use a more secure approach to handle the value parameter, such as using a whitelist of allowed attributes.
3. Consider using a more secure version of Ruby on Rails, such as 4.0.9 or 4.1.5, which has already addressed this vulnerability.  ```ruby
