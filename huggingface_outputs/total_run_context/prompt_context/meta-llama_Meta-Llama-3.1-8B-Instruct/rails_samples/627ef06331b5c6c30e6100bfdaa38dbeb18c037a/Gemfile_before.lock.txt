 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a Gemfile, which lists dependencies for a Ruby project. The vulnerability CVE-2018-8048 is related to the Loofah gem, which is listed as a dependency in the Gemfile with a version of 2.1.1. This version is affected by the vulnerability. However, the Gemfile does not contain any code that would introduce the vulnerability, as it is a declaration of dependencies. The vulnerability would be introduced in the code that uses the Loofah gem to sanitize HTML.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Update the Loofah gem to a version that is not affected by the vulnerability, such as 2.2.0 or later. Additionally, ensure that any code that uses the Loofah gem to sanitize HTML is properly configured to prevent non-whitelisted HTML attributes from being introduced. This may involve configuring the Loofah gem to only allow specific HTML attributes or using a different HTML sanitization library.
