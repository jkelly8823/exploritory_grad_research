 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a Gemfile, which lists dependencies for a Ruby project. The vulnerability CVE-2018-8048 is related to the Loofah gem, which is used for HTML sanitization. However, the code sample does not contain any Loofah gem usage, but it does list the Loofah gem as a dependency. This suggests that the project may be vulnerable to the CVE-2018-8048 vulnerability if the Loofah gem is used in the project's code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the project's code to ensure that the Loofah gem is not being used for HTML sanitization.
- If the Loofah gem is being used, update it to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2018-8048 (version 2.2.0 or later).
- Consider using a different HTML sanitization library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```
