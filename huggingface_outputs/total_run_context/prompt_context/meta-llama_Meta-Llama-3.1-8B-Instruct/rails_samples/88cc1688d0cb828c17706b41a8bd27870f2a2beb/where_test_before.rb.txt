 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of the `where` method with a blank value. The `where` method in Rails is not designed to handle blank values, and it can lead to object-injection attacks and other security issues. The `where` method is used with a blank value in line 5 of the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using the `where` method with blank values.
- Use the `where` method with a valid condition that checks for the presence of data.
- Consider using the `where` method with a `not` condition to exclude blank values. For example: `Edge.where("sink_id IS NOT NULL")`. 
- Always validate user input to prevent such vulnerabilities. 
- Consider upgrading to a newer version of Rails that has this vulnerability fixed.  ```ruby
