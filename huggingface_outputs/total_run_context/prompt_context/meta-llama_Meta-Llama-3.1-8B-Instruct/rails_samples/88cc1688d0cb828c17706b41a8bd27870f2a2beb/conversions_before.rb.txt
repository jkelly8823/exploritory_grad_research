 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of `ActiveSupport::XMLConverter` which can lead to object-injection attacks and execution of arbitrary code. The `from_xml` method is not properly restricting casts of string values, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Ruby on Rails that is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 (e.g., 2.3.15, 3.0.19, 3.1.10, or 3.2.11).
2. Use a secure alternative to `ActiveSupport::XMLConverter`, such as a library that properly sanitizes and validates XML input.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent object-injection attacks. 
4. Consider using a more secure XML parsing library, such as `nokogiri`, which provides better security features and is less prone to vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
