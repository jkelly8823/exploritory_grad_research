 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of a crafted JSON string that can lead to object-injection attacks. The JSON string contains a syntax error, which can be exploited to inject arbitrary code. This is a classic example of a YAML/JSON deserialization vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate user input to prevent malicious JSON strings from being deserialized.
- Use a safe deserialization library or framework that can prevent object-injection attacks.
- Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific types of data to be deserialized. 
- Regularly update dependencies, including Ruby on Rails, to ensure you have the latest security patches.  ```ruby
    )
  end

  test "logs error if parsing unsuccessful" do
    with_test_routing do
      output = StringIO.new
      json = "[\"person]\": {\"name\": \"David\"}}"

```ruby
