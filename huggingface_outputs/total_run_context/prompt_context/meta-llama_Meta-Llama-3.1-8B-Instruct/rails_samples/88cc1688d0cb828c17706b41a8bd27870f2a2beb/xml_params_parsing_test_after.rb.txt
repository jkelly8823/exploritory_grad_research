 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of the `assert_parses` method, which can be exploited to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code. The `assert_parses` method is used to test the parsing of XML data, but it does not properly restrict casts of string values, making it vulnerable to attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Ruby on Rails to version 2.3.15, 3.0.19, 3.1.10, or 3.2.11 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure method to parse XML data, such as using a library like Nokogiri, which is designed to handle XML parsing securely.
3. Validate user input data to prevent object-injection attacks. 
4. Use a secure method to handle XML entity references, such as using a library like LibXML, which is designed to handle XML entity references securely. 
5. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent object-injection attacks. 
6. Regularly update and patch Ruby on Rails to ensure that any
