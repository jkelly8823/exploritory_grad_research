EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of the `with_test_routing` method which may allow for object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code. This is because the method does not properly restrict casts of string values.

- Use a more secure method to set up the test routing, such as using a library like `rails-controller-testing`.
- Validate user input to prevent object-injection attacks.
- Consider upgrading to a newer version of Ruby on Rails that includes the fix for CVE-2013-0156.
