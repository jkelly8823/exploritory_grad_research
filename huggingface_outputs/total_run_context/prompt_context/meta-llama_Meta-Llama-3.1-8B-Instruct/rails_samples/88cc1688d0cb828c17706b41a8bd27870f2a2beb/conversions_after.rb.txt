 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the lack of proper restriction on casts of string values. The `from_xml` method does not properly handle XML attributes with `type="yaml"` or `type="symbol"`, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `from_xml` method to properly handle disallowed types by checking the `type` attribute of XML attributes and raising a `DisallowedType` exception if it matches a disallowed type.
2. Use the `Hash.from_trusted_xml` method to parse XML that contains attributes with `type="yaml"` or `type="symbol"`.
3. Consider using a more secure XML parsing library that properly handles disallowed types.
