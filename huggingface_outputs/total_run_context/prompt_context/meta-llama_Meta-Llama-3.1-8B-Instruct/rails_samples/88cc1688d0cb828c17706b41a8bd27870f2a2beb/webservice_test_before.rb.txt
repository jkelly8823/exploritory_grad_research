 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of YAML.load() which can lead to object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code. This is because the YAML.load() function does not properly restrict casts of string values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace YAML.load() with a safer alternative such as YAML.safe_load() to prevent object-injection attacks.
- Consider using a more secure serialization format such as JSON. 
- Ensure that the YAML parser is properly configured to prevent arbitrary code execution. 
- Regularly update and patch the Ruby on Rails framework to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed.  ```
