 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 because it uses YAML.load() which can lead to object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code. The code is also vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155 because it does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace YAML.load() with a safer alternative such as YAML.safe_load() to prevent object-injection attacks.
- Implement proper parameter validation and sanitization to prevent NULL checks and missing WHERE clauses. 
- Consider using a more secure JSON parser such as json-parser or yajl-ruby to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  ```
