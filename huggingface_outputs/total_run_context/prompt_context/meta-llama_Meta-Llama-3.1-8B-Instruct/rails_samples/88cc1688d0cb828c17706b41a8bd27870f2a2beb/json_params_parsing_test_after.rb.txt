 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155 due to the lack of proper consideration for differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the Active Record component and the JSON implementation are properly configured to handle NULL values consistently.
- Implement additional validation and sanitization checks to prevent crafted requests from bypassing database-query restrictions.
- Consider upgrading to a more secure version of Ruby on Rails to address this vulnerability.  ```ruby
