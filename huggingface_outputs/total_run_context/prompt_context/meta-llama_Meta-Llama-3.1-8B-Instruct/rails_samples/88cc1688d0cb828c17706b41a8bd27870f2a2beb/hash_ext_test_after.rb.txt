 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code is using the Hash.from_xml method to parse XML into a hash, which is a safe and secure way to do so. The CVEs describe vulnerabilities in the Active Support library, specifically in the way it handles type conversions and parameter handling. However, the code provided does not use any of the vulnerable methods or functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described CVEs. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to use the latest version of the Active Support library. Additionally, it's a good idea to review the code and ensure that it is not using any other vulnerable methods or functionality.  The code is using the Hash.from_xml method which is a safe and secure way to parse XML into a hash. The code is also using the ActiveSupport::XMLConverter::DisallowedType to disallow certain types of attributes, which is a good practice to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  The code is also using the HashWithIndifferentAccess to handle unknown keys, which is a good
