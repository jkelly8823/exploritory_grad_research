 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0156 due to the use of an empty array in the Edge.where() method. This can lead to object-injection attacks and execution of arbitrary code. The use of an empty hash in the Post.where() method is also a potential vulnerability, as it can bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace the empty array in the Edge.where() method with a valid condition, such as a non-empty array or a specific value.
- Use a valid condition in the Post.where() method, such as a non-empty hash or a specific value.
- Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
- Regularly update and patch Ruby on Rails to ensure you have the latest security fixes.  ```
