 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the improper restriction of casts of string values. Specifically, the lines 14-15 in the test_post_xml_using_a_disallowed_type_attribute method allow for the creation of a symbol or YAML object from an XML string, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly restrict casts of string values, such as by using a whitelist of allowed types.
2. Consider using a more secure XML parsing library that can prevent object-injection attacks.
3. Ensure that the code properly handles and sanitizes user-input data to prevent similar vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code in the test_register_and_use_yaml method does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The use of the with_params_parsers method to specify a custom YAML parser for the Mime::YAML type does not seem to introduce any vulnerabilities related to object-injection attacks or parameter handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard.
