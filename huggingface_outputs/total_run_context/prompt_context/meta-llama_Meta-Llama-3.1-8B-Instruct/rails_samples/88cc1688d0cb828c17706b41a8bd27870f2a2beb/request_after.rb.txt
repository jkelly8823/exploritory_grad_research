 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential object-injection attack due to the use of regular expressions in the `deep_munge` method. The `=~` operator can be used to inject arbitrary code, which can lead to a denial of service or even code execution. This is a classic example of a "regular expression injection" vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `=~` operator with a safer method, such as `==` or `===`.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and prevent any malicious code from being executed.
3. Consider using a more robust and secure method for parsing query strings, such as a dedicated library or framework. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0156
CVE Description:
active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.15, 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before 3.2.11 does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows remote attackers to conduct object-injection
