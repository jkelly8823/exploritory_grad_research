 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential object-injection attack due to the use of =~ operator on the LOCALHOST variable. The =~ operator can be used to inject arbitrary code, which can lead to a denial of service or even remote code execution. This is a classic example of a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the =~ operator with a safe comparison operator, such as == or ===.
2. Validate user input to prevent any potential injection attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to compare IP addresses, such as using a dedicated IP address validation library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0156
CVE Description:
active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.15, 3.0.x before 3.0.19, 3.1.x before 3.1.10, and 3.2.x before 3.2.11 does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial
