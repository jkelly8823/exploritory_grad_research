 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the raw method on the paragraph variable. The raw method prevents the HTML from being escaped, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted HTML attribute. This is a classic example of an XSS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the raw method should be removed and the paragraph variable should be properly escaped using the h method. The corrected code should look like this: content_tag(wrapper_tag, h(paragraph), html_options, false). This will ensure that any HTML in the paragraph variable is properly escaped and cannot be used to inject malicious code.  Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input to prevent XSS attacks.  This can be achieved by using a library like Sanitize or a custom validation function.  This will help prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  It is also recommended to use the Rails built-in helpers such as sanitize or strip_tags to sanitize user input.  This will help prevent XSS attacks and ensure the security of the application.  It is also recommended to use the Rails built-in helpers such as sanitize or strip
