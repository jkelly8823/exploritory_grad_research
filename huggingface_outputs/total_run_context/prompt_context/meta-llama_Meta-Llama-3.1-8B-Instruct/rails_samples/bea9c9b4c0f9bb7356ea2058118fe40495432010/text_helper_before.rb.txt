VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because it uses the `html_safe` method on the result of `paragraphs.map! { |paragraph| content_tag(wrapper_tag, paragraph, html_options, false) }.join("\n\n")`. This method prevents Rails from escaping the HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the `sanitize` method to sanitize the HTML before rendering it. For example: `paragraphs.map! { |paragraph| content_tag(wrapper_tag, paragraph, html_options, false) }.join("\n\n").sanitize` or use the `raw` method to prevent Rails from escaping the HTML, but only if you are sure that the HTML is safe. For example: `raw(paragraphs.map! { |paragraph| content_tag(wrapper_tag, paragraph, html_options, false) }.join("\n\n))`. However, using `html_safe` is generally discouraged due to the potential for XSS attacks.  Additionally, consider using a library like `sanitize` or `dompurify` to sanitize the HTML.  Also, ensure that the `wrapper_tag` and `html
