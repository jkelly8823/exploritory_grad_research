 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8185 vulnerability. The code snippet is a part of a Rails application and it seems to be implementing a custom redirect logic. However, it does not contain any code that would allow an untrusted user to run pending migrations on a Rails app running in production. The `actionable_request?` method checks for specific conditions (show exceptions, POST request, and a specific path) that do not seem to be related to migration execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the CVE-2020-8185 vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it behaves as expected in different scenarios.
