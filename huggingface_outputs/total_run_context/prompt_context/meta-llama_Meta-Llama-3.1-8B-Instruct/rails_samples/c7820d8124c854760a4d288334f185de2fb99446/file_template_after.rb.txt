VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a File Content Disclosure vulnerability. The `source` method reads the contents of a file using `::File.binread @filename`, which can potentially expose the contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem if the `@filename` parameter is not properly sanitized. This is a classic example of a File Content Disclosure vulnerability, where an attacker can manipulate the `@filename` parameter to disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the `@filename` parameter to ensure it only points to authorized files.
- Consider using a more secure method to read files, such as using a library that provides secure file reading functionality.
- Ensure that the `refresh` method is not used to disclose sensitive information, as it is not necessary for the functionality of the class. Consider removing or securing this method.  ```ruby
```ruby
class FileContentDiscloser
  attr_accessor :filename

  def initialize(filename)
    @filename = filename
  end

  def source
    # Validate and sanitize the filename before reading the file
    if File.exist?(@filename) && @filename =~ /\A\/[a-zA
