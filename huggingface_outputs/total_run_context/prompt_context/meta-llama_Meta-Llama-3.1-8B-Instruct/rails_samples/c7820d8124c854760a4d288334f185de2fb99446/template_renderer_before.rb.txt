VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the `find_file` method which can potentially expose contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem. This is because the `find_file` method does not properly sanitize the `options[:file]` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify a file path that is not intended to be accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `options[:file]` parameter to ensure it only accepts intended file paths.
2. Implement proper error handling to prevent disclosure of sensitive information in case of an error.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the files that can be accessed. 
4. Update the `find_file` method to use a secure method for resolving file paths, such as `Pathname` or `URI`. 
5. Consider using a library like `rails-security` to help identify and fix security vulnerabilities.  ```ruby
# Sanitize the options[:file] parameter
options[:file] = File.expand_path(options[:file], Rails.root)

# Implement proper error handling
begin
  @lookup_context.with_fallbacks.find_file(options[:file], nil, false,
