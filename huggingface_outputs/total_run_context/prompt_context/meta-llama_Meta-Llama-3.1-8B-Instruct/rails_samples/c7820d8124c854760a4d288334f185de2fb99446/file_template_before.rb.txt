 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a File Content Disclosure vulnerability. The `source` method reads the contents of a file using `File.binread` and returns it. This can be exploited by an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem by manipulating the `@filename` attribute.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the `@filename` attribute to prevent arbitrary file access.
- Consider using a more secure method to read files, such as `File.open` with proper error handling.
- Ensure that the `refresh` method is not used to disclose sensitive information. 
- Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent such vulnerabilities.  ```ruby
    def source
      # Validate and sanitize the filename
      filename = File.expand_path(@filename)
      if!filename.start_with?(Rails.root.join('public').to_s)
        raise SecurityError, "Invalid filename"
      end
      File.binread(filename)
    end
```  ```ruby
    def refresh(_)
      # Do not return sensitive information
      # Instead, return a success message or a default value
      { success: true
