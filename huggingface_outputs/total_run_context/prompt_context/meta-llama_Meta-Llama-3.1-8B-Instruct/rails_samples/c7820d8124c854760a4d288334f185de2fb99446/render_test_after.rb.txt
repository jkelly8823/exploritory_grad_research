 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the use of `assert_deprecated` in the `test_render_file` method. This method is deprecated and can be exploited to disclose contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `assert_deprecated` block in the `test_render_file` method.
2. Use a secure method to render files, such as using a secure template engine or a file system abstraction layer.
3. Update the code to use the latest version of Action View, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
