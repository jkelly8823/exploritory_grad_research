 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the use of `Regexp.escape` on the file name. This allows an attacker to inject malicious file names that can be used to disclose arbitrary files on the system. The `Regexp.escape` method is not sufficient to prevent this type of attack, as it only escapes special characters in the file name, but does not prevent the use of directory traversal or other types of attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to sanitize the file name, such as using a whitelist of allowed file names or using a library that provides secure file path manipulation.
2. Consider using a more secure way to handle the accept headers, such as using a library that provides secure header parsing.
3. Update the Action View version to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue. VULNERABILITY LIST:
