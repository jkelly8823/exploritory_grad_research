 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the File Content Disclosure vulnerability described in CVE-2019-5418. The code is using the ApplicationController.renderer.new to render a file, but it does not appear to be using any accept headers that could be used to disclose arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem. The file path "test/hello_world" is hardcoded and does not appear to be user-controlled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to validate and sanitize any user-controlled input to prevent potential vulnerabilities. In this case, the file path is hardcoded and does not appear to be user-controlled, but it is still a good practice to validate it to prevent potential issues.  ```bash
