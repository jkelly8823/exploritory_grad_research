VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a File Content Disclosure vulnerability. This is because the `renderer.render` method is being used with a file path that is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially manipulate the file path to disclose contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a whitelist approach to validate the file path before rendering it.
- Consider using a more secure method to render files, such as using a template engine that supports secure file rendering.
- Ensure that the `renderer.render` method is called with a properly sanitized file path. This can be achieved by using a method that escapes any special characters in the file path.  ```ruby
# Before
renderer.render file: "test/hello_world"

# After
renderer.render file: ActionController::Base.helpers.sanitize("test/hello_world")
