VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the use of `File.expand_path` in the `test_render_file_with_full_path` method. This allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem by providing a specially crafted file path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to resolve the file path, such as `Rails.root.join` or `Pathname`.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent file path manipulation.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict access to specific files and directories. VULNERABILITY LIST:
