 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the File Content Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2019-5418) due to the use of the `RenderFile` class, which can potentially expose contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem. This is because the `RenderFile` class does not properly sanitize the file path, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file path and disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade the `RenderFile` class to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g., >= 5.2.2.1).
- Use a secure method to render files, such as using a whitelist of allowed file paths or using a secure file rendering library.
- Avoid using deprecated methods and classes, as they may introduce security vulnerabilities. 
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from manipulating the file path. 
- Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of files that can be rendered. 
- Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure. 
- Consider using a security-focused framework or library to help identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.  ```ruby
