 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the use of `File.basename(file_name)` which can lead to arbitrary file exposure. The regular expression used to match the line number is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. An attacker can manipulate the `file_name` parameter to disclose contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `file_name` parameter to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Use a more secure method to determine the line number, such as using a secure library or a custom implementation that does not rely on regular expressions.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the files that can be accessed. 
4. Update the code to use a more secure version of Action View. 
5. Implement additional security measures, such as logging and monitoring, to detect and prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```ruby
