 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the use of the `file` parameter in the `buffered_render` method. This allows an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem by providing a specially crafted `file` parameter. The `test_render_file` and `test_render_file_with_locals` methods are vulnerable as they directly pass the `file` parameter to the `buffered_render` method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `file` parameter to ensure it only accepts valid file paths within the application's directory structure.
2. Use a whitelist approach to restrict the files that can be rendered.
3. Consider using a more secure method to render files, such as using a dedicated file rendering service.
