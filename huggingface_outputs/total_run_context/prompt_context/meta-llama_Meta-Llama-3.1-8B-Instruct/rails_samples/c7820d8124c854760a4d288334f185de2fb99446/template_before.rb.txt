 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a File Content Disclosure vulnerability. The variable `@virtual_path` is used to determine the base name of the file path, which can be used to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem. This is because the `File.basename` method can be used to extract the file name from the path, and the regular expression used to extract the base name can be used to disclose the contents of files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the `@virtual_path` variable to ensure it is a valid file path.
2. Use a whitelist approach to restrict the files that can be accessed.
3. Avoid using `File.basename` and instead use a safer method to extract the file name, such as `Pathname` or `URI`.
4. Consider using a more secure way to handle file paths, such as using a library like `pathnorm` or `pathspec`. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. 6. Consider using a security-focused framework or library to help identify and prevent vulnerabilities. 7.
