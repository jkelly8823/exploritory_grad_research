 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to File Content Disclosure due to the fact that it allows the user to specify a file path using the `:file` option. This can be exploited by an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the `File.exist?` method is called and the file is opened using `Template::File.new(options[:file])`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the file path to ensure it is within the allowed directory.
2. Use a whitelist approach to restrict the file types that can be rendered.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a template engine that does not rely on file I/O. 
4. Update the code to handle the case where the file does not exist, without disclosing the file path. 
5. Remove the deprecation warning and instead handle the case where the file does not exist in a more secure manner.  ```ruby
if options.key?(:file)
  if File.exist?(options[:file]) && File.directory?(options[:file])
    Template::File.new(options[:file])
  else
    #
