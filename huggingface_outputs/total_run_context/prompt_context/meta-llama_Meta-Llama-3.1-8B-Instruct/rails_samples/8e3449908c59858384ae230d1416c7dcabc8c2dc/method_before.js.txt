 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack. This is because the code is generating a CSRF token but it is not being validated on the server-side. An attacker could potentially trick a user into performing an unintended action by manipulating the CSRF token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the CSRF token on the server-side to ensure it matches the one generated by the client-side code.
2. Use a secure method to generate and store the CSRF token, such as using a library like `csrf-token` or `express-csrf`.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle form submissions, such as using a library like `jquery-form` or `axios`.
