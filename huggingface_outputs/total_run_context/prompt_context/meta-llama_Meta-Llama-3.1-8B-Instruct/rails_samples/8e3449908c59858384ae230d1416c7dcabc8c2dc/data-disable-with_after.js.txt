 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a DOM-based XSS attack. The 'data-disable-with' attribute is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This vulnerability can be exploited when the 'data-disable-with' attribute is used in conjunction with a contenteditable element, as seen in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the 'data-disable-with' attribute to prevent XSS attacks. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides sanitization functionality.
2. Avoid using the 'data-disable-with' attribute in conjunction with contenteditable elements, as this can create a vulnerability. Instead, consider using a different approach to achieve the desired functionality. 
3. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within a web page. This can help prevent XSS attacks by specifying which scripts are allowed to run. 
4. Regularly update and patch dependencies to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed. 
5. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks, including XSS. 6. Use a code analysis tool to
