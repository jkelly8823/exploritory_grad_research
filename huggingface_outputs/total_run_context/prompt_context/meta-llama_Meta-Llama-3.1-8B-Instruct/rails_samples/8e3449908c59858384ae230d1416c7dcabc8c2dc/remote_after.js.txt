 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential bug due to the incorrect return statement in the isRemote function. The return statement is placed before the if condition, which means it will always return false regardless of the condition. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the return false statement to after the if condition to ensure it only returns false when the element is content editable.
2. Consider adding a check to ensure that the element has the "data-remote" attribute before trying to get its value. This can prevent a potential null pointer exception. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Incorrect return statement in the isRemote function. 
2. Potential null pointer exception when trying to get the value of the "data-remote" attribute.  ```javascript
