 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential bug due to the incorrect return statement in the isRemote function. The return statement is placed before the variable declaration, which will cause a syntax error. This can be fixed by moving the return statement to the end of the function.

- Move the return statement to the end of the function.
- Add a check to ensure that the element has the "data-remote" attribute before attempting to get its value.
