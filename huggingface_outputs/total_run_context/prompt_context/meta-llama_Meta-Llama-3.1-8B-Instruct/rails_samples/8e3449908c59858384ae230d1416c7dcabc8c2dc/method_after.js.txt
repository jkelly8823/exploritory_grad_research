 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack because it does not properly validate the CSRF token. The `csrf.csrfToken()` function is called, but the token is not verified against the expected value. This allows an attacker to forge a request and execute unintended actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the CSRF token by comparing it with the expected value.
2. Use a secure method to generate and store the CSRF token, such as using a token-based authentication system.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in CSRF protection, such as Rails' built-in CSRF protection.
