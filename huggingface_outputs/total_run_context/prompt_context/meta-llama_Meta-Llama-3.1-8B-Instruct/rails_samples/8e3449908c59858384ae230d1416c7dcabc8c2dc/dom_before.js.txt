 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a DOM-based XSS attack. The function $() uses the document.querySelectorAll() method to select elements, but it does not properly sanitize the input. An attacker could inject malicious code by providing a specially crafted selector, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize the input selector.
2. Use a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed selectors.
3. Consider using a more secure method to select elements, such as using a library like jQuery. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. DOM-based XSS attack
2. Insecure use of document.querySelectorAll() 
3. Lack of input validation and sanitization.  ```
