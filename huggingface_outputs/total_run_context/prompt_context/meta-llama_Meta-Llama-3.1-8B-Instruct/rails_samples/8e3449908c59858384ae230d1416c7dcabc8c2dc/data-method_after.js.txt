 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The 'data-method' attribute is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This is particularly concerning because the 'delete' method is being used, which could potentially delete sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the 'data-method' attribute to prevent XSS attacks. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed methods.
2. Use a library like jQuery's 'on' method to handle events instead of 'triggerNative' to prevent potential XSS attacks.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into the code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
2. Potential data deletion due to unvalidated user input.
