 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential bug due to the incorrect usage of the variable 'element'. In the 'handleDisabledElement' function, the variable 'element' is reassigned to 'e' in the line 'element = e'. This can cause unexpected behavior and potential bugs in the code. The correct usage of the variable 'element' should be maintained throughout the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the line 'element = e' to maintain the correct usage of the variable 'element'.
2. Update the function to use the correct variable 'element' throughout the function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Incorrect usage of variable 'element' in the 'handleDisabledElement' function.
