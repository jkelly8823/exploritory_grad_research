 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of the LIMIT parameter. Although the sanitize_limit method is implemented to handle comma-delimited lists of integers, it does not prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code by providing a non-numeric argument. This is because the sanitize_limit method relies on the to_i method to convert the limit parameter to an integer, which will return 0 for non-numeric values. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust sanitization method that can handle non-numeric arguments, such as using a regular expression to validate the input.
2. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be achieved by using a library like ActiveRecord that supports parameterized queries.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle LIMIT parameters, such as using a separate method to validate and sanitize the limit parameter before passing it to the SQL query.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
