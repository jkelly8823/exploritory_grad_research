 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The sanitize_limit method does not properly sanitize the limit parameter, allowing for potential SQL injection attacks. This is because it uses the Integer method to convert the limit parameter to an integer, which can be vulnerable to SQL injection if the limit parameter is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the sanitize_limit method does not handle cases where the limit parameter is not a string, which can also lead to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to sanitize the limit parameter, such as using a regular expression to ensure that the limit parameter is a valid integer.
2. Add input validation to ensure that the limit parameter is a string before attempting to convert it to an integer.
3. Consider using a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks altogether. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-0448
CVE Description:
Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not ensure that arguments to the limit function specify integer values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a non-numeric argument. 
Code Sample:
        "WHERE #{quoted_primary_key} IN
