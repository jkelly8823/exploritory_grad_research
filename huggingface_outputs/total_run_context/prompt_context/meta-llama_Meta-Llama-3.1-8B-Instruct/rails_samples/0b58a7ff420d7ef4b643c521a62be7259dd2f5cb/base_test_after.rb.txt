 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any instances of the suspected vulnerability. The code is designed to test the limit function in Ruby on Rails, and it includes checks to prevent SQL injection attacks. The limit function is called with a string argument, but it is checked to ensure that it does not contain any SQL keywords. If the argument contains a SQL keyword, an ArgumentError is raised. This suggests that the code is designed to prevent the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0448.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the suspected vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest security patches and best practices. Additionally, consider using a linter or code analyzer to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-0448
CVE Description:
Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not ensure that arguments to the limit function specify integer values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a non-numeric argument.  Code Sample:
