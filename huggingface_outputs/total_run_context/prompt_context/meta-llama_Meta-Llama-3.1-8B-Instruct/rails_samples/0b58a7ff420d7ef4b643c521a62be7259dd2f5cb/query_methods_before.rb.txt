 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of the limit function without ensuring that the argument is an integer. The limit function is used to limit the number of rows returned from a query, but if the argument is not an integer, it can be exploited to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the to_i method to ensure that the @limit_value is an integer before passing it to the limit function. For example: arel.limit(@limit_value.to_i) if @limit_value. This will prevent any non-numeric values from being passed to the limit function and prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using parameterized queries or an ORM that supports parameterized queries to further prevent SQL injection attacks.  ```ruby
arel.limit(@limit_value.to_i) if @limit_value
``` 
VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-0448
CVE Description: Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not ensure that arguments to the limit function specify integer values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a non-numeric argument.
