 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-22794 vulnerability. The `annotate` method is not properly sanitizing the input, allowing for potential SQL injection attacks. The `regexp_escape_table_name` method is used to escape the table name, but it does not prevent the injection of malicious SQL code within the comment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more robust sanitization method, such as `sanitize_sql_comment` provided by ActiveRecord, to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the `annotate` method.
- Consider upgrading to a newer version of ActiveRecord that includes the fix for this vulnerability.  ```ruby
def test_annotate_is_sanitized
  quoted_posts_id, quoted_posts = regexp_escape_table_name("posts.id"), regexp_escape_table_name("posts")

  assert_sql(%r{SELECT #{quoted_posts_id} FROM #{quoted_posts} /\* \* /foo/ \* \*/}i) do
    posts = Post.select(:id).annotate(sanitize_sql_comment("*/foo/*"))
    assert posts.first
  end

  #... rest of the code remains the same
