 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The sanitize_as_sql_comment method does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for potential SQL injection attacks. The method uses regular expressions to remove leading and trailing whitespace and comment characters, but it does not account for nested comments or other edge cases. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by crafting a specially formatted comment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the sanitize_as_sql_comment method to properly handle nested comments and other edge cases.
2. Consider using a more robust sanitization library, such as Sanitize or DOMPurify, to ensure that user input is properly sanitized.
3. Review the column_name_matcher method to ensure that it is not vulnerable to similar attacks.
