 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of comments. The `annotate` and `optimizer_hints` methods do not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious input to be injected into the database. This is a known vulnerability in ActiveRecord versions <6.0.6.1, v6.1.7.1, and v7.0.4.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a version of ActiveRecord that is not vulnerable (e.g. >=6.0.6.1, >=6.1.7.1, >=7.0.4.1).
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the `annotate` or `optimizer_hints` methods.
