 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The sanitize_as_sql_comment method does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for potential SQL injection attacks. The regular expression used in this method may not cover all possible malicious input, making it vulnerable to CVE-2023-22794.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the sanitize_as_sql_comment method to use a more robust sanitization technique, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters or a dedicated SQL comment sanitizer library.
- Consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure against known vulnerabilities.  ```ruby
def sanitize_as_sql_comment(value) # :nodoc:
  # Update the regular expression to cover all possible malicious input
  value.to_s.gsub(%r{ (/ (?: | \g<1>) \*) \+? \s* | \s* (\* (?: | \g<2>) /) }x, "")
  # Use a whitelist of allowed characters to sanitize the input
  value.to_s.gsub(/[^\w\s]/, "")
end
``` ```ruby
