 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input. The `annotate` method does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious input to be injected into the SQL query. This is a known vulnerability in ActiveRecord versions prior to 6.0.6.1, v6.1.7.1, and v7.0.4.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update ActiveRecord to a version that is not vulnerable (6.0.6.1, v6.1.7.1, or v7.0.4.1 or later).
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the `annotate` method. 
- Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input.  ```ruby
    def annotate(*args)
      # Validate and sanitize user input
      args = args.map { |arg| sanitize_input(arg) }
      check_if_method_has_arguments!(__callee__, args)
      spawn.annotate!(*args)
    end
``` 
```ruby
def sanitize_input(input)
  # Implement a sanitization function to remove malicious characters
