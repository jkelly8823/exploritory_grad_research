 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-22794 vulnerability. The `annotate` method is not properly sanitizing the input, allowing for potential SQL injection attacks. Although the code sample is using the `regexp_escape_table_name` method to escape the table name, it is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks when using the `annotate` method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `annotate` method to properly sanitize the input using a library like `SQL::Identifier` to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to add annotations to the query, such as using a separate method that does not allow user input to be executed as SQL.  ```ruby
# Using SQL::Identifier to sanitize the input
def annotate(sql)
  SQL::Identifier.new(sql).to_sql
end

# Using parameterized queries
def annotate(sql)
  Post.select(:id).annotate(sql)
end
```  ```ruby
