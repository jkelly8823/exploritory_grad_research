EXPLANATION:
The regular expression in DOMAIN_REGEXP is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. This is because the regular expression engine can enter a state of catastrophic backtracking when it encounters a specially crafted input. The regular expression /[^.]*\.([^.]*|..\...|...\...)$/ is particularly vulnerable because it uses a non-greedy match (.*?) which can cause the engine to backtrack excessively. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the regular expression to use a more efficient and safe pattern. For example, you can use the following regular expression: /[^.]+\.([^.]+)$/. This regular expression uses a greedy match (.*+) which is less prone to catastrophic backtracking.
2. Consider using a more robust regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the `oniguruma` gem, which is designed to handle complex regular expressions and prevent catastrophic backtracking.
3. If possible, avoid using regular expressions for this purpose and instead use a more efficient and safe method to extract the domain from the input string. For example, you can use the `URI
