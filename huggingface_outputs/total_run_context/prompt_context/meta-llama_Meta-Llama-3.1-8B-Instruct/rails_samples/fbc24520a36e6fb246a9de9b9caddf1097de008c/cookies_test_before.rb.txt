 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any regular expression based code that could potentially lead to a DoS vulnerability. The code is using the `delete` method of the `cookies` hash to delete a cookie with a specific domain and TLD length. The `head :ok` method is used to return a successful response. The code also includes tests for setting and deleting cookies with different domain options.
