VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `/([^.]{2,3}\.[^.]{2})$/.match?(request.host)` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. This is because the regular expression engine can enter a state of catastrophic backtracking when it encounters a specially crafted input. The regular expression is trying to match a string that ends with a TLD, but it's doing so in a way that can cause the engine to backtrack excessively. This can lead to a denial of service vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust regular expression that is less prone to catastrophic backtracking. For example, you can use a regular expression that uses possessive quantifiers or atomic grouping to prevent backtracking.
2. Consider using a more efficient algorithm to determine the TLD of the domain. For example, you can use a library like `tldextract` to extract the TLD from the domain.
3. If you're unable to use a more robust regular expression or a more efficient algorithm, consider adding a limit to the number of backtracks that the regular expression engine is allowed to perform. This can help prevent the engine from entering a state of catastrophic backtracking
