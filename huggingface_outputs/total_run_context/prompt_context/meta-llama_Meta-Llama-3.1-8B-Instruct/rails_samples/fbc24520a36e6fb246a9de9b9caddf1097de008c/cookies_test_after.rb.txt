VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2023-22792 vulnerability. The code does not use a regular expression engine that is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking. The code is using the `cookies` hash to set and delete cookies, which is a safe and secure way to handle cookies in Rails.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to fix the vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and follow secure coding practices. Consider using a linter or a code analyzer to identify potential security issues in your code.  ```bash
bundle update
``` 
and 
```bash
rails security:check
``` 
to ensure your application is secure. 
```ruby
# No code changes are required
```
