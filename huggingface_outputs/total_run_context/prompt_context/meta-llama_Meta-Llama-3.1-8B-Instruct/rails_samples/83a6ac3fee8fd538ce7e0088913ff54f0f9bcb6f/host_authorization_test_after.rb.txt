 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack. The middleware is configured to allow hosts with a leading dot, which can be exploited by a specially crafted `Host` header to redirect users to a malicious website. This vulnerability is present in the test cases where the `HOST` header is set to a value with a leading dot, such as `example.com#sub.example.com`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Action Pack to version 6.1.2.1 or 6.0.3.5 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Remove the `#` character from the `HOST` header value in the test cases to prevent the vulnerability.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to host authorization, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts instead of relying on the `Host` header. 4. Remove the deprecated `config setting action_dispatch.hosts_response_app` and use the recommended approach instead. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 6. Consider using a security-focused testing framework to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 7. Implement a
