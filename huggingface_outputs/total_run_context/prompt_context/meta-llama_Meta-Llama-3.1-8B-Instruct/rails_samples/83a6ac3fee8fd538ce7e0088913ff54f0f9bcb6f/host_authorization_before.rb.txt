 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the way it handles the `HTTP_HOST` header. The `sub` method is used to remove the port number from the host, but this can be exploited by an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website. The `x_forwarded_host` header is also not properly validated, which can lead to similar issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to remove the port number from the host, such as using a regular expression to match the port number and remove it.
2. Validate the `x_forwarded_host` header to ensure it is not being used to redirect users to a malicious website.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the `HTTP_HOST` header, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts. 
4. Implement a check to ensure that the `@permissions.allows?` method is not being used with user-controlled input. 
5. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against open redirect vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
