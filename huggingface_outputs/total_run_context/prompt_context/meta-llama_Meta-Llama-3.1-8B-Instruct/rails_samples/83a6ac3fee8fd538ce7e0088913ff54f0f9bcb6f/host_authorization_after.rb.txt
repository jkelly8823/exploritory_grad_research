 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the use of a regular expression to match the host header. The regular expression allows for a leading dot in the host header, which can be used to redirect to a malicious website. This is a known vulnerability in the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the regular expression to not allow a leading dot in the host header.
2. Use a more secure method to validate the host header, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against open redirect vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22881
CVE Description: The Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5 suffers from an open redirect vulnerability. Specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain "allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially
