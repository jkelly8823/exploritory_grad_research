 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the use of the `Host` header in the `HostAuthorization` middleware. This allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website by crafting a specially formatted `Host` header.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the `HostAuthorization` middleware to use a more secure method of validating host headers, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.
- Remove the use of the `Host` header in the `HostAuthorization` middleware and instead use a more secure method of validating host headers.
- Update the `config.action_dispatch.hosts` setting to use a more secure method of validating host headers. 
- Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
