 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential XSS attack due to the use of unsanitized HTML in the ActionText attachments. Although the sanitize_action_text_content method is used to sanitize the content, it is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks. The sanitizer_allowed_tags method is used to specify the allowed tags, but it does not prevent the execution of JavaScript code within the allowed tags. This is a known vulnerability in ActionText and has been fixed in 7.1.3.4 and 7.2.0.beta2.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a version of ActionText that is not vulnerable (7.1.3.4 or 7.2.0.beta2).
- Use a more secure method to sanitize the content, such as using a library like sanitize-rails.
- Remove the use of ActionText attachments if possible, and use a more secure alternative.  ```
