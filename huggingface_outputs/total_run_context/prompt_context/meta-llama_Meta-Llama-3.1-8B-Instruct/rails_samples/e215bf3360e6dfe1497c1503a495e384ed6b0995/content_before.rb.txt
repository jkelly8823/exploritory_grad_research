 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unsanitized HTML injection. The `render_attachments` method uses the `fragment.replace` method to replace the content of the fragment with a new HTML tag. However, this new HTML tag is generated by the `block.call` method, which is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the content of the fragment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should sanitize the HTML code generated by the `block.call` method. You can use the `sanitize` method from the `ActionText` module to sanitize the HTML code. For example, you can modify the `render_attachments` method as follows:
```ruby
def render_attachments(**options, &block)
  content = fragment.replace(ActionText::Attachment.tag_name) do |node|
    sanitized_attachment = block.call(attachment_for_node(node, **options))
    ActionText.sanitize(sanitized_attachment)
  end
  self.class.new(content, canonicalize: false)
end
