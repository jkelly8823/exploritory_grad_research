EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any instances of ActionText::Attachable::ContentAttachment, which is the specific component that could potentially contain unsanitized HTML. The code is focused on testing the default behavior of the to_trix_content_attachment_partial_path method for a Page model instance.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the ActionText library.
