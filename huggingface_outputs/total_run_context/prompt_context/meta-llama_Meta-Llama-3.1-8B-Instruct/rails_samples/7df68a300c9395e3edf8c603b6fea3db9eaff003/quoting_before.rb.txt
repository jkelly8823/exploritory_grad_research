 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper handling of bitstring quoting. The code uses regular expressions to match the bitstring notation, but it does not properly sanitize the input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that matches the regular expression but contains malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to sanitize the input, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters.
2. Avoid using regular expressions to match complex patterns, as they can be difficult to maintain and may introduce security vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in support for bitstring quoting and sanitization.
