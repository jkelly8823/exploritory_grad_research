VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper quoting of user input in the `quote` method. In the `test_quote_range` method, the `quote` method is called with a user-provided string that contains a malicious SQL query. The `quote` method does not properly sanitize the input, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Similarly, in the `test_quote_bit_string` method, the `quote` method is called with a user-provided string that contains a malicious SQL query, which is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Implement proper input sanitization in the `quote` method to prevent malicious SQL queries from being executed.
3. Use a library or framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks, such as Rails' built-in protection.  ```ruby
# Use parameterized queries
@conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id =?", [user_id])

# Implement proper input sanitization
def quote(input)
  # Sanitize the input to prevent malicious SQL queries
  sanitized_input = input.gsub(/';
