 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of the `@connection.async_exec(sql)` method, which directly executes the provided SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `sql` parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. In this case, consider using the `@connection.execute` method with parameterized queries.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious SQL code from being injected.
- Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like ActiveRecord, which provides built-in protection against SQL injection.
