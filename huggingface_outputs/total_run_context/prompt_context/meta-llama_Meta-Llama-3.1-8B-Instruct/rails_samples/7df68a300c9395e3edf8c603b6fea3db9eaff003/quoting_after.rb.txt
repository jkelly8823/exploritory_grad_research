 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper handling of bitstring quoting. The regular expression /range$/ is used to check if the sql_type is a range, but it does not account for other types of bitstrings. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by providing a specially crafted bitstring value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the regular expression to properly handle all types of bitstrings.
2. Use a more secure method to quote the bitstring value, such as using a parameterized query.
3. Consider using a library that provides robust SQL injection protection, such as Rails' built-in parameterized query support.  ```ruby
