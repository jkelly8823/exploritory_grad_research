 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of the `async_exec` method, which does not properly sanitize user input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `sql` parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Update the `exec_no_cache` method to use a parameterized query or a prepared statement.
- Consider using an ORM like ActiveRecord that provides built-in protection against SQL injection.
