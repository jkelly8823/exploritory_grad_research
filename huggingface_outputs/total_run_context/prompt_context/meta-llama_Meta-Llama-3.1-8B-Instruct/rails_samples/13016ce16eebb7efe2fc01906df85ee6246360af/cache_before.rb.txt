 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression based DoS vulnerability due to the use of the `split` method with a regular expression that can cause catastrophic backtracking. This is related to the If-None-Match header and can be exploited by a specially crafted HTTP request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a version of Ruby that is 3.2.0 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Alternatively, use a safer method to split the string, such as `split(',')` or `split(/\s*,\s*/n)`.
- Consider using a more secure library or framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
