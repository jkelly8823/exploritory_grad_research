 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression based DoS vulnerability due to the use of the `split` method on the `if_none_match` variable. This can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking when a specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header is received. This is a known vulnerability in Action Dispatch versions <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to Action Dispatch version 6.1.7.1 or later, or version 7.0.4.1 or later.
- Use a workaround, such as using a different method to parse the If-None-Match header, or using a regular expression that is less prone to catastrophic backtracking. 
- Consider using a more secure method to handle the If-None-Match header, such as using a dedicated library or module.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
