 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the use of the `gsub` method with a regular expression that does not properly escape all special characters. The `JS_ESCAPE_MAP` hash is used to replace certain characters with their escaped equivalents, but it does not cover all possible special characters that could be used in an XSS attack. Additionally, the use of the `html_safe?` method does not provide sufficient protection against XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to escape special characters, such as the `ERB::Util.h` method.
2. Use a library that provides more comprehensive protection against XSS attacks, such as the `rails-html-sanitizer` gem.
3. Remove the `html_safe?` method and instead use the `sanitize` method to properly escape all special characters.
