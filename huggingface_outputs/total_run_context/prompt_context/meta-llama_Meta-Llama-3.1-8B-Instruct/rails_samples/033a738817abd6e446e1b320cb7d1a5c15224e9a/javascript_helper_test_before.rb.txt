 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the use of the `j` method, which does not properly escape HTML tags. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the `h` method instead of `j` to properly escape HTML tags. For example, replace `j(%(dont </close> tags))` with `h(%(dont </close> tags))`. Additionally, ensure that all user-input data is properly sanitized before passing it to the `escape_javascript` method.
