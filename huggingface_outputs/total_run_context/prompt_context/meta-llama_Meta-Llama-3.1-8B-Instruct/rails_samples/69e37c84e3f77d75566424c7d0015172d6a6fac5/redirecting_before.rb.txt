 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to open redirect attacks. This is because the `location` attribute is set to the result of `_enforce_open_redirect_protection`, which does not appear to be checking if the redirect is to a trusted location. This allows an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site by manipulating the `redirect_to` method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a whitelist of trusted locations to check against before setting the `location` attribute.
2. Use a more secure method to handle redirects, such as using a library like `rack-redirect` which provides built-in protection against open redirect attacks. 
3. Consider using a more secure redirect method, such as `redirect_to` with a `host` option, which allows you to specify the host of the redirect. 
4. Remove the `allow_other_host` option, as it can be used to bypass the open redirect protection. 
5. Update the `_enforce_open_redirect_protection` method to check if the redirect is to a trusted location before setting the `location` attribute.  ```ruby
def _enforce_open_redirect_protection(location, allow_other_host: false)
