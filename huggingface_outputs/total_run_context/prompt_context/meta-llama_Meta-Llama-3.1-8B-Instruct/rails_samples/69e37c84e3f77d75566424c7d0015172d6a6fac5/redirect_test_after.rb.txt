 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code contains two potential vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is in the method `unsafe_redirect_with_illegal_http_header_value_character` where the redirect URL contains an illegal HTTP header field character. The second vulnerability is in the method `only_path_redirect` where the redirect URL is not properly sanitized, allowing for potential open redirect attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the redirect URL in `unsafe_redirect_with_illegal_http_header_value_character` with a sanitized URL.
2. Use the `url_for` method to generate the redirect URL in `only_path_redirect` to ensure it is properly sanitized. For example: `redirect_to url_for(action: "other_host", only_path: true)`.

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Open Redirect Vulnerability
2. Open Redirect Vulnerability (unsanitized redirect URL)  ```python
```python
def test_unsafe_redirect_with_illegal_http_header_value_character():
    with pytest.raises(ActionController::Redirecting::UnsafeRedirectError):
        get('/unsafe_redirect_with_illegal_http_header_value_character')

def test_only_path_redirect():
    get('/only_path_redirect')
    assert response.status_code == 302
