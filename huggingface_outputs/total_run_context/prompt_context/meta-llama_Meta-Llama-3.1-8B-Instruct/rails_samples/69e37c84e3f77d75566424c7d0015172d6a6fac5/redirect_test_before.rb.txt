VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability. The redirect_to method is being used with a string argument, which can be manipulated by an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious website. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to trick the user into visiting a website that they did not intend to visit.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the url_for method instead of redirect_to with a string argument. This will prevent the vulnerability. For example, change the line to: redirect_to url_for(action: "other_host", only_path: true) VULNERABILITY LIST: 
1. Open Redirect Vulnerability 
2. Path Traversal Vulnerability 
3. SQL Injection Vulnerability 
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability 
5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability  VULNERABLE: YES

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. The redirect_to method is being used with a string argument that contains a path traversal character ('///'). This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory, which is
