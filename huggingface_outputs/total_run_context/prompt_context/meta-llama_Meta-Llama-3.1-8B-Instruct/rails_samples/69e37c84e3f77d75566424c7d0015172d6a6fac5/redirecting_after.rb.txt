EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect attack. This is because the `_enforce_open_redirect_protection` method does not properly validate the redirect URL. The `_ensure_url_is_http_header_safe` method checks if the URL contains any illegal HTTP header field characters, but it does not check if the URL is a valid redirect URL. An attacker could potentially trick the application into redirecting to a malicious URL by manipulating the `redirect_to_location` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a proper validation for the redirect URL in the `_enforce_open_redirect_protection` method. This could involve checking if the URL is a valid redirect URL and if it is not a relative URL.
2. Consider using a library like `uri` to parse the redirect URL and validate its components.
3. Update the `_ensure_url_is_http_header_safe` method to check for more than just illegal HTTP header field characters. For example, it could also check if the URL contains any suspicious characters or patterns. 
4. Consider implementing a whitelist of allowed redirect URLs to further prevent open redirect attacks. 
5. Update the `UnsafeRedirectError` class to include more information about
