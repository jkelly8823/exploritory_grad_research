 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The strip_tags function in the provided code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because the function uses the full_sanitizer.sanitize method to sanitize the input HTML, which does not properly handle all types of malicious input. Specifically, it does not prevent the execution of JavaScript code within the HTML. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the input HTML, which would then be executed by the browser when the sanitized HTML is rendered.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the strip_tags function should be modified to use a more robust sanitization method, such as the Rails built-in sanitize method, which is designed to prevent XSS attacks. The function should also be updated to handle all types of malicious input, including JavaScript code. Additionally, the function should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is not vulnerable to any other types of attacks.
