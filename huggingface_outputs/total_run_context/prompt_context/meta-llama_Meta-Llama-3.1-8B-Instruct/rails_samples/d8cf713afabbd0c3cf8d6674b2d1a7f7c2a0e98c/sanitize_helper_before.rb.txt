 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The strip_tags function in the provided code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This is because the function uses the full_sanitizer.sanitize method to strip HTML tags from the input string, but it does not properly handle all types of HTML tags. Specifically, it does not remove script tags, which can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via malformed HTML markup.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the strip_tags function should be modified to properly remove all types of HTML tags, including script tags. This can be achieved by using a more robust HTML sanitizer, such as the Nokogiri library. Alternatively, the function can be modified to use a whitelist approach, where only specific, safe HTML tags are allowed. For example:
```ruby
def strip_tags(html)
  allowed_tags = %w(b i u strong em)
  Nokogiri::HTML::DocumentFragment.parse(html).css("*").each do |node|
    node.remove if!allowed_tags.include?(node.name)
  end
  node.to_s
end
