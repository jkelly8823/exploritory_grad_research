EXPLANATION:
The strip_tags function is not properly sanitizing the input, allowing for potential XSS attacks. This is evident in the line where it is asserted that the output of strip_tags should be equal to the input, which could potentially contain malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a more robust sanitization method, such as Rails' built-in sanitize helper, which is designed to prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, ensure that the input is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the strip_tags function.
