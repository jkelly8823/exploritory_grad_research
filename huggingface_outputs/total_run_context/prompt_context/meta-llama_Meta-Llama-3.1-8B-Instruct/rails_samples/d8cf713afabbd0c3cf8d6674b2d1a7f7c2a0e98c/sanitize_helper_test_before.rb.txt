 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the strip_tags function not properly sanitizing the input. The function is not designed to handle all types of malicious HTML and can be exploited by injecting arbitrary web script or HTML via malformed HTML markup.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the strip_tags function with a more robust sanitization library such as Rails' built-in sanitize function or a third-party library like sanitize or html-sanitizer. Additionally, ensure that the input is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the strip_tags function.
