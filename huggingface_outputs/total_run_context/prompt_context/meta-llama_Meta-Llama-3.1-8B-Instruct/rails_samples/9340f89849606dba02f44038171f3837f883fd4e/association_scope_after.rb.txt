 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of the `interpolate` method without proper sanitization of user input. The `interpolate` method is used to create a SQL query string from a hash of conditions, which can lead to SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. Additionally, the use of `disambiguate_condition` method does not provide sufficient protection against SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries instead of string interpolation to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Sanitize user input before passing it to the `interpolate` method.
3. Use a library like `ActiveRecord::QueryMethods` to create queries that are safe from SQL injection attacks.
