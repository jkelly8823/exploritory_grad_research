 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of the `interpolate` method on user-provided input (`conditions`). The `interpolate` method is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries instead of string interpolation to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and patterns.
3. Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like ActiveRecord to handle database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2661
CVE Description: The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.13, 3.1.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.4 does not properly implement the passing of request data to a where method in an ActiveRecord class, which allows remote attackers to conduct certain SQL injection attacks via nested query parameters that leverage unintended recursion, a
