 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the SQL injection attack described in CVE-2012-2661. The code checks if the input value is a hash and if so, it uses Arel to build a query. However, the code does not directly pass user input to the Arel query, which is the primary vector for the SQL injection attack. Additionally, the code checks if the column name includes a '.' which could potentially prevent the attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this specific vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to validate and sanitize user input to prevent other potential attacks. Consider using a library like Arel to build queries and avoid directly passing user input to SQL queries.
