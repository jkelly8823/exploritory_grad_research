 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the SQL injection attack described in CVE-2012-2661. The code checks if the value is a hash and maps over it, but it does not pass the hash values directly to an ActiveRecord class without proper sanitization. Additionally, the code checks if the column name includes a '.' and does not use the value directly in a SQL query. However, it's worth noting that the code does not handle the case where the value is not a hash or an array, which could potentially lead to other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add a check to handle the case where the value is not a hash or an array.
- Consider using a more robust method to sanitize the column name and values, such as using Arel's built-in methods or a library like sql-sanitizer. 
- Consider adding additional logging or error handling to catch any potential issues that may arise from this code.  ```
