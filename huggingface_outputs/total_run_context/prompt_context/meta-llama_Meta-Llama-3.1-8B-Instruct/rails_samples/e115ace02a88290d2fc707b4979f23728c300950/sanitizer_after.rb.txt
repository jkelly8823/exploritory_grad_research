 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1857 because it does not properly handle encoded : (colon) characters in URLs. The regular expression in the protocol_separator variable allows for the inclusion of encoded colon characters, which can be exploited by an attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the protocol_separator regular expression to exclude encoded colon characters. For example, change the regular expression to /:|(&#x3a;)|(%|&#37;)3A/i to exclude the &#x3a; sequence.
2. Consider using a more robust library for URL parsing and validation, such as the URI class in Ruby's standard library. This can help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```ruby
self.protocol_separator     = /:|(&#x3a;)|(%|&#37;)3A/i
```  ```ruby
require 'uri'
self.protocol_separator     = URI::regexp
```  ```ruby
```  ```ruby
