 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains a vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the sanitize helper in the code does not properly handle encoded : (colon) characters in URLs. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious code by including a &#x3a; sequence in a crafted scheme name. The code attempts to sanitize the input using the HTML::WhiteListSanitizer, but it does not account for the encoded characters, allowing the XSS attack to succeed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the sanitize helper to properly handle encoded : (colon) characters in URLs.
2. Use a more robust sanitization library that can handle encoded characters, such as the sanitize gem.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious code from being injected in the first place. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters and checking the input against this whitelist.  ```ruby
def validate_input(input)
  allowed_chars = /\A[a-zA-Z0-9\s\.,!?-]+\z/
  if input =~ allowed_chars
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end
