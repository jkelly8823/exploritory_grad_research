 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1857 because it does not properly handle encoded : (colon) characters in URLs. The regular expression used to match the protocol separator includes the encoded colon character (&#x3a;), which can be exploited by an attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the regular expression to properly handle encoded colon characters. This can be done by adding a negative lookahead assertion to ensure that the encoded colon character is not followed by a valid protocol.
2. Consider using a more robust library for URL parsing and validation, such as the `URI` class in Ruby's standard library. This can help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 3. Regularly review and update the list of allowed protocols to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date. 4. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to further protect against XSS attacks. 5. Update the code to handle other types of encoded characters that may be used to exploit the vulnerability. 6. Consider using a more secure method for storing and retrieving sensitive data,
