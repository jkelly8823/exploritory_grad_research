 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains a vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in the use of encoded colon characters in URLs, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. The code attempts to sanitize the input using the HTML::WhiteListSanitizer, but it does not properly handle encoded colon characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the HTML::WhiteListSanitizer to properly handle encoded colon characters.
2. Use a more robust sanitization library, such as OWASP's ESAPI.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious characters from being injected into the code. 
4. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed. 
5. Regularly update dependencies to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
