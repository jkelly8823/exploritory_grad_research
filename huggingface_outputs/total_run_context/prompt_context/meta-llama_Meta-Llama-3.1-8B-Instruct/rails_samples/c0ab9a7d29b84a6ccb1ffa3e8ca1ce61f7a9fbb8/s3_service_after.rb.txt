 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8162 because it allows the Content-Length of a direct file upload to be modified by an end user bypassing upload limits. This is due to the fact that the `content_length` parameter is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the `content_length` parameter to ensure it matches the actual file size.
- Consider using a secure upload library that handles file uploads securely, such as `paperclip` or `carrierwave`. 
- Remove the `whitelist_headers: ['content-length']` option, as it allows the `Content-Length` header to be modified by the client. 
- Update the `rails` version to 5.2.4.2 or later, or 6.0.3.1 or later to patch the vulnerability.  ```bash
gem 'rails', '>= 5.2.4.2'
``` or
gem 'rails', '>= 6.0.3.1'
``` 
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as file size validation and content type validation, to
