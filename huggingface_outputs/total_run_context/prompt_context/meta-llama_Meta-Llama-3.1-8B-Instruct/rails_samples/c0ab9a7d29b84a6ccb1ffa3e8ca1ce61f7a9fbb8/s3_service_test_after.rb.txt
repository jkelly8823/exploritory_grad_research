 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8162 vulnerability. This is because the code is directly uploading a file to the server without validating the content length. The line `request.add_field "Content-Length", data.size - 1` is setting the content length to be one less than the actual size of the data, which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass upload limits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the content length of the file before uploading it to the server.
2. Use a secure method to upload files, such as using a multipart/form-data request.
3. Ensure that the server-side validation is in place to prevent attacks like this.
