 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8162 because it allows the Content-Length of a direct file upload to be modified by an end user bypassing upload limits. This is due to the fact that the content_length parameter is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the content_length parameter to ensure it matches the actual file size.
- Consider using a secure upload library that handles file uploads securely, such as CarrierWave or Paperclip.
- Update the Rails version to 5.2.4.2 or later, or 6.0.3.1 or later to patch the vulnerability.  ```
