 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a possible escalation to RCE vulnerability due to the use of YAML serialized columns in Active Record. This is because the code is using the `yaml_load` method to deserialize YAML data, which can be manipulated by an attacker to escalate to RCE. The vulnerability exists in the `test_roundtrip_serialized_column` method, where the `yaml_load` method is used to deserialize the YAML data stored in the `content` attribute of the `Topic` model.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Active Record to version 7.0.3.1 or later, or version 6.1.6.1 or later, or version 6.0.5.1 or later, or version 5.2.8.1 or later.
- Use a safer deserialization method, such as `YAML.safe_load`, to prevent RCE attacks.
- Validate and sanitize user input data to prevent SQL injection attacks.  ```ruby
