 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 vulnerability because it enables the use of YAML unsafe load, which can be exploited to escalate to an RCE. This is done by setting `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load` to `true` in the setup block.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load` to `false` to prevent the vulnerability.
- Ensure that the `ActiveRecord::Base.filter_attributes` is set to a secure value, such as `[:name, :email]`, to prevent data manipulation via SQL injection.
- Consider upgrading to a version of Active Record that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as version 7.0.3.1 or later.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32224
CVE Description:
A possible escalation to RCE vulnerability exists when using YAML serialized columns in Active Record < 7.0.3.1, <6.1.6.1, <6.0.5.1 and <5.2.8.1 which could allow an attacker, that can manipulate
