 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 due to the usage of YAML serialized columns in Active Record. Although the code does not explicitly use YAML serialized columns, the usage of `json_data` attribute in the `@john` object suggests that it might be using a similar mechanism to store data. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate data in the database and escalate to an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to the latest version of Active Record (7.0.3.1 or later, 6.1.6.1 or later, 6.0.5.1 or later, or 5.2.8.1 or later).
- Avoid using YAML serialized columns or similar mechanisms to store data.
- Consider using a more secure data storage mechanism, such as a separate database table or a secure data storage library.  ```ruby
