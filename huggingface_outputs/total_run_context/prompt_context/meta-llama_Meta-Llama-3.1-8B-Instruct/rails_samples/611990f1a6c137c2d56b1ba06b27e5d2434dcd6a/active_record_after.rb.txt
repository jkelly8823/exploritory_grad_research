 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to use YAML serialized columns in Active Record. The code is related to configuring the YAML Coder and setting up eager loading for Active Record. The use of `use_yaml_unsafe_load` and `yaml_column_permitted_classes` attributes suggests that the code is attempting to configure the YAML Coder, but it does not indicate that YAML serialized columns are being used. Additionally, the code does not contain any lines that would suggest the presence of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
