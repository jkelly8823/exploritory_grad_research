VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32224
CVE Description:
A possible escalation to RCE vulnerability exists when using YAML serialized columns in Active Record < 7.0.3.1, <6.1.6.1, <6.0.5.1 and <5.2.8.1 which could allow an attacker, that can manipulate data in the database (via means like SQL injection), the ability to escalate to an RCE.

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any YAML serialized columns or configuration options that would allow an attacker to escalate to RCE. The `config.active_storage` configuration options are related to Active Storage, not Active Record, and do not appear to be related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-32224.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE.
