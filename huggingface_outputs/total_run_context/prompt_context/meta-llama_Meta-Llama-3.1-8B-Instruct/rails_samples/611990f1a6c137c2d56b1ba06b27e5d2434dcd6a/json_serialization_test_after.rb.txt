 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 because it is using YAML serialized columns in Active Record. The line where the preferences hash is defined is the vulnerable line. This is because the preferences hash is being serialized and stored in the database, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the data and escalate to an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to Active Record 7.0.3.1 or later, 6.1.6.1 or later, 6.0.5.1 or later, or 5.2.8.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Avoid using YAML serialized columns in Active Record.
- Use a secure serialization method, such as JSON, to store data in the database. 
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.  ```ruby
