 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to a possible escalation to RCE vulnerability due to the use of YAML serialized columns in Active Record. This vulnerability exists in versions of Active Record prior to 7.0.3.1, 6.1.6.1, 6.0.5.1, and 5.2.8.1. The code is using Active Record to interact with the database, which makes it susceptible to this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to the latest version of Active Record (7.0.3.1 or later, 6.1.6.1 or later, 6.0.5.1 or later, or 5.2.8.1 or later).
- If upgrading is not possible, consider using a different serialization method that is not vulnerable to RCE. 
- Ensure that any data being stored in the database is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential attacks. 
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to further protect against potential attacks.  ```python
