VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a possible escalation to RCE vulnerability due to the use of YAML serialized columns in Active Record. This vulnerability exists in versions of Active Record prior to 7.0.3.1, 6.1.6.1, 6.0.5.1, and 5.2.8.1. The code is using a version of Active Record that is susceptible to this vulnerability.
