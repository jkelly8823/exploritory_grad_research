 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be using YAML serialized columns in Active Record. The code is setting up a singleton class and defining a method to eager load associations, but it does not involve YAML serialization. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions for the CVE-2022-32224 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to address this vulnerability.
