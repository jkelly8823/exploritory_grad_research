 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is using Active Record, which is vulnerable to a possible escalation to RCE vulnerability when using YAML serialized columns in versions less than 7.0.3.1, 6.1.6.1, 6.0.5.1, and 5.2.8.1. However, the code does not explicitly use YAML serialized columns. Nevertheless, the code is using Active Record, and the vulnerability is related to the usage of serialized columns, which is a concern.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Active Record to version 7.0.3.1 or later, or version 6.1.6.1 or later, or version 6.0.5.1 or later, or version 5.2.8.1 or later.
- Avoid using serialized columns if possible.
- Consider using a more secure serialization method, such as JSON.
