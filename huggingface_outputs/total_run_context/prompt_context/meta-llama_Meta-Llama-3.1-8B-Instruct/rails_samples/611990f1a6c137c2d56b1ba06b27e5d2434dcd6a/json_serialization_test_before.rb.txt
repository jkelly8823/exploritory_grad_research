 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 because it is using YAML serialized columns in Active Record. The line where the vulnerability is present is where the avatar attribute is being set to "binarydata". This is a potential entry point for an attacker to manipulate data in the database and escalate to an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using YAML serialized columns in Active Record. Instead, use a secure method to store binary data, such as using a separate table or a binary data type. Additionally, ensure that you are using the latest version of Active Record to prevent this vulnerability. If you cannot upgrade, you should consider using a different serialization method, such as JSON.
