 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 because it is using YAML serialized columns in Active Record. The `update!` method is used to update the topic's content with a payload that contains a YAML serialized object. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the data in the database and escalate to an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to Active Record 7.0.3.1 or later, 6.1.6.1 or later, 6.0.5.1 or later, or 5.2.8.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Avoid using YAML serialized columns in Active Record.
- Use a secure method to update the topic's content, such as using a secure hash or encryption. 
- Validate and sanitize any user input before updating the database.  ```ruby
