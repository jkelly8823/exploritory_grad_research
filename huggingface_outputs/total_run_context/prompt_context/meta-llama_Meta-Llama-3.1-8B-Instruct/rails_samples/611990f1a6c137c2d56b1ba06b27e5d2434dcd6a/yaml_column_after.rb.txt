VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any direct references to YAML serialized columns or the specific versions of Active Record that are vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224. However, it does contain methods related to YAML serialization, specifically `yaml_load` and `raise ArgumentError`. The `yaml_load` method checks if `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load` is true, and if so, it uses `YAML.unsafe_load` or `YAML.load` to deserialize the payload. This could potentially be used to exploit the vulnerability if the code is using an affected version of Active Record and the attacker can manipulate the data in the database. Nevertheless, the code snippet itself does not contain any vulnerable code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the version of Active Record being used to ensure it is not affected by the CVE-2022-32224.
- Consider disabling `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load` to prevent potential exploitation.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent SQL injection attacks, such as using parameterized queries or prepared statements.  ```ruby
