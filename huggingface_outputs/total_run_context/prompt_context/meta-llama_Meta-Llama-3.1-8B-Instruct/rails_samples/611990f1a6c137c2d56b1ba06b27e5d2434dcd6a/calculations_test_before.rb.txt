 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not directly utilize YAML serialized columns in Active Record, but it does demonstrate the use of the `pluck` method which can be used to extract data from the database. However, the `pluck` method can be used in conjunction with other methods that may utilize YAML serialized columns, potentially leading to the escalation of a vulnerability. Therefore, it is recommended to exercise caution when using the `pluck` method in conjunction with other methods that may be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using the `pluck` method when working with data that may be vulnerable to this issue.
- Consider using alternative methods, such as `select` or `map`, to extract data from the database.
- Ensure that all dependencies, including Active Record, are up-to-date to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
