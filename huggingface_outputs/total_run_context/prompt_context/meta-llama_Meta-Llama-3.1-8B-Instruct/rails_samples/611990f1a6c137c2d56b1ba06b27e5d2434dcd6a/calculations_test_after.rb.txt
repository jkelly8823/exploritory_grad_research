 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any YAML serialized columns, nor does it use the `pluck` method with a qualified column name that could potentially lead to an RCE vulnerability. The `pluck` method is used to retrieve a list of attributes from a model, and in this case, it is used to retrieve the `content` attribute of the `Topic` model. The `content` attribute is not a YAML serialized column, and the `pluck` method is not used with a qualified column name that could lead to an RCE vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to use the latest version of Rails to ensure you have the latest security patches.  ```ruby
