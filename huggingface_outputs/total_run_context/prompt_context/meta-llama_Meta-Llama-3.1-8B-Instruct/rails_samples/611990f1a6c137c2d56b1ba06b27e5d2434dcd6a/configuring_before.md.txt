 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 because it uses Active Record which is affected by the vulnerability. The code does not provide any specific configuration options for Active Record, but it does use the `config.active_storage` which is a part of Active Record. This makes the code vulnerable to the RCE vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Active Record to version 7.0.3.1 or later, 6.1.6.1 or later, 6.0.5.1 or later, or 5.2.8.1 or later.
- Use a different serialization format that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as JSON or XML. 
- Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
