 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224 because it uses YAML serialized columns in Active Record. The `yaml_load` method is used to deserialize the YAML data, which can lead to an escalation to RCE vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the data in the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Active Record to version 7.0.3.1 or later, 6.1.6.1 or later, 6.0.5.1 or later, or 5.2.8.1 or later.
- Use a secure deserialization method, such as `YAML.safe_load`, to prevent code injection attacks.
- Validate and sanitize user input data to prevent SQL injection attacks.  ```ruby
