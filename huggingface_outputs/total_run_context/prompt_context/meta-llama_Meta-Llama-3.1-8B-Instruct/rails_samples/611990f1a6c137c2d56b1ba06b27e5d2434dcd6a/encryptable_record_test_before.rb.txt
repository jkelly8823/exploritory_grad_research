VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any YAML serialized columns. The vulnerability described in CVE-2022-32224 is related to the use of YAML serialized columns in Active Record, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future.  The code does not use YAML serialized columns, but it does use Active Record, so it is recommended to keep the Active Record version up-to-date.  Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices, such as validating user input and using secure encryption methods.  It is also recommended to use a linter and a code analyzer to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.  Finally, it is recommended to perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  It is also recommended to use a secure coding standard, such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Guide.  It is also recommended to use a code review process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.  It is also recommended to use
