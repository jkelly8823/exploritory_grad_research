VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32224. The code is using `ActiveRecord::Coders::JSON` for serialization, which is not vulnerable to the YAML serialization issue mentioned in the CVE. Additionally, the code is using `ActiveRecord.use_yaml_unsafe_load = false` in the `SerializedAttributeTestWithYamlSafeLoad` class, which further mitigates the risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the CVE-2022-32224. However, it's always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to regularly review the code for potential vulnerabilities.  ```
