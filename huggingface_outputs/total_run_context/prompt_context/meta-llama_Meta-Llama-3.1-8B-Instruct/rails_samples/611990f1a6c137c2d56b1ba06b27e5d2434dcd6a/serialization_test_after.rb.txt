 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any YAML serialized columns, which are the primary concern for the CVE-2022-32224 vulnerability. The code appears to be a simple hash with various attributes, none of which are related to YAML serialization.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as the code does not contain any vulnerable components. However, it's essential to ensure that any serialized data is properly sanitized and validated to prevent potential security issues. Consider using secure serialization methods, such as JSON or MessagePack, if YAML is not necessary. Additionally, keep your dependencies up-to-date, especially for libraries like Active Record, to ensure you have the latest security patches.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32224
CVE Description:
A possible escalation to RCE vulnerability exists when using YAML serialized columns in Active Record < 7.0.3.1, <6.1.6.1, <6.0.5.1 and <5.2.8.1 which could allow an attacker, that can manipulate data in the database (via means like SQL injection), the ability to escalate to an RCE.
