 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5418 because it does not properly sanitize the accept headers, allowing for specially crafted headers to cause contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem to be exposed. This is evident in the line where the HTTP_ACCEPT header is set to "text/plain, mime/another", which could potentially be used to disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the accept headers are properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.
- Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, safe headers to be processed.
- Regularly update Action View to the latest version to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```ruby
class ContentNegotiationController < ApplicationController
  def basic
    #...
  end

  def all
    #...
  end
end
