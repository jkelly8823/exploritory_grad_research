 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5418 because it does not properly handle specially crafted accept headers. In the test "A js or */* Accept header will return HTML", the code returns HTML when the accept header is "text/javascript, */*". This allows an attacker to disclose the contents of arbitrary files on the target system's filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the accept header to ensure it does not contain any malicious values.
- Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific accept headers.
- Update Action View to the latest version to patch the vulnerability.
