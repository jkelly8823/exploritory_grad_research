 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to the File Content Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2019-5418) and the possible denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2019-5419) due to the use of specially crafted accept headers. The code allows for the registration of custom MIME types, which can be used to disclose file contents or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Action View to a version that is not vulnerable (>= 5.2.2.1, >= 5.1.6.2, >= 5.0.7.2, >= 4.2.11.1).
2. Implement input validation and sanitization for the accept headers to prevent specially crafted headers from being used to exploit the vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling custom MIME types, such as using a whitelist of allowed types.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5418
