 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the File Content Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2019-5418) because it uses the `respond_to` block to handle different content types, but it does not properly sanitize the `accept` header. An attacker could potentially exploit this by sending a specially crafted `accept` header that includes a file path, causing the server to disclose the contents of an arbitrary file on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the `accept` header and only allow specific, expected content types.
2. Implement a mechanism to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information, such as logging or auditing.
3. Update the `Mime::Type` registrations to use a more secure approach, such as using a hash table instead of a global registry.
