 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided does not contain any code that would allow for specially crafted accept headers to cause a file content disclosure or denial of service. The code is filtering the formats based on the symbol or ref being "*/*", which is a common way to filter out malicious accept headers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to regularly review your code for potential security vulnerabilities.  The code could be improved by adding additional logging or error handling to detect and prevent potential security issues.  Consider adding a check to ensure that the accept header is not too large or contains any malicious characters.  This could be done by adding a simple validation check before setting the header.  For example: `if v.size > 1024 then # handle the error end`  This would prevent a potential denial of service attack by limiting the size of the accept header.  However, this is not necessary in this case as the code is already filtering out malicious headers
