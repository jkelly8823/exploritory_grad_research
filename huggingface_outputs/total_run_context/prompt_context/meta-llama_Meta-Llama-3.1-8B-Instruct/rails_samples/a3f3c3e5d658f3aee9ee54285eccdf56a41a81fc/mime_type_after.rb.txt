 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack due to the use of the `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` regular expression. This regular expression can cause the parser to take a long time to execute when given a large input, potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` regular expression to use a more efficient and safe pattern, such as `/\s*q=?/`.
2. Consider using a more robust parsing library or framework that can handle large inputs efficiently.
3. Add input validation to ensure that the `accept_header` parameter is not too large or complex. This can help prevent the ReDoS attack.
