 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization. The `from_xml` method uses the `ActiveSupport::XMLConverter` class to parse the XML input, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) if the input contains malicious XML entity references.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input XML data before parsing it.
2. Use a safe and secure XML parsing library, such as Nokogiri, to parse the input XML.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization checks in the `normalize_keys` and `process_hash` methods to prevent object-injection attacks. 
4. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific XML elements and attributes to be parsed. 
5. Regularly update and patch the Ruby on Rails framework to ensure you have the latest security patches.  ```ruby
