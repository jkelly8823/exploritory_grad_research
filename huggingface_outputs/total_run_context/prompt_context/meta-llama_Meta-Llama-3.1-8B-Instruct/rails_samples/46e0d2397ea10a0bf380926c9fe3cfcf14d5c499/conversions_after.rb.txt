 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the lack of proper restriction on casts of string values. Specifically, the `from_xml` method does not properly handle XML attributes with `type="yaml"` or `type="symbol"`, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `from_xml` method to properly restrict casts of string values by checking the `type` attribute of XML attributes and raising an error if it matches a disallowed type.
2. Use the `Hash.from_trusted_xml` method to parse XML that contains attributes with `type="yaml"` or `type="symbol"`.
3. Consider using a more secure XML parsing library that does not have this vulnerability.
