 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. This is because the code is using Marshal.dump to serialize and deserialize data, which can be exploited by an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects. The lines 3 and 7 are the lines where the data is being deserialized using Marshal.dump.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer serialization method such as JSON or MessagePack. You can replace Marshal.dump with JSON.dump and Marshal.load with JSON.load. Additionally, you should validate the input data to ensure it is safe to deserialize. You can use a library such as safe_yaml to validate the input data.
