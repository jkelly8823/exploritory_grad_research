VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8165 because it uses the `deserialize_entry` method to deserialize user-provided objects in the `MemCacheStore` and `RedisCacheStore`. This can allow an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects, potentially resulting in an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure deserialization method, such as `YAML.safe_load`, to deserialize user-provided objects.
- Validate user-provided objects before deserializing them.
- Consider using a cache store that does not support deserialization, such as `MemoryStore`. 
- Update Rails to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-8165.  (Rails 5.2.4.3 and Rails 6.0.3.1 are vulnerable.)  If you cannot update Rails, consider using a different cache store.  If you cannot use a different cache store, consider disabling deserialization in the cache store.  If you cannot disable deserialization, consider using a different cache store.  If you cannot use a different cache store, consider disabling deserialization in the cache store.  If you
