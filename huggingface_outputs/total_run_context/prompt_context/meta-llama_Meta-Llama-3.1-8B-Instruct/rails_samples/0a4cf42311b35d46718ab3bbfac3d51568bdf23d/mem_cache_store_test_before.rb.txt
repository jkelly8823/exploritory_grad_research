VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. This is because the `Marshal.dump` function is used to serialize data, which can be unmarshaled by an attacker to potentially result in an RCE. The `lookup_store` function is called twice in the `test_local_cache_raw_values` method, which can lead to a different cache store being used, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure serialization method, such as `JSON.dump` or `YAML.dump`, instead of `Marshal.dump`.
- Ensure that the `lookup_store` function is called consistently throughout the code to prevent different cache stores from being used. 
- Validate user-provided data before unmarshaling it to prevent potential RCE attacks.  ```ruby
def test_raw_values_with_marshal
  cache = lookup_store(raw: true)
  cache.write("foo", JSON.dump([]))
  assert_equal [], cache.read("foo")
end

def test_local_cache_raw_values
  cache = lookup_store(raw: true)
  cache.with_local_cache do
    cache.write("foo", JSON.dump
