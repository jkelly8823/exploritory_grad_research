 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. This is because the deserialize_entry method is called with a raw_value that is not validated or sanitized. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious raw_value that, when deserialized, could lead to an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the raw_value before passing it to the deserialize_entry method.
- Consider using a safer deserialization method, such as JSON.parse, instead of Marshal.load.
- Ensure that the local_cache is properly configured and validated to prevent unauthorized access.  ```ruby

  def upload_file
    file = ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile.new(
