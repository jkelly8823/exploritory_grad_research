 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155 because it does not properly handle nil values in XML parameters. In the test "nils are stripped from collections", the code is testing the stripping of nil values from collections, but it does not consider the potential for a crafted request to bypass intended database-query restrictions. The test "parses hash params" also demonstrates a lack of consideration for nil values in XML parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle nil values in XML parameters, such as by using a whitelist of allowed values or by using a more robust XML parsing library.
2. Review the code to ensure that it is properly considering differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling XML parameters, such as by using a library that is designed to handle XML securely.  ```ruby
