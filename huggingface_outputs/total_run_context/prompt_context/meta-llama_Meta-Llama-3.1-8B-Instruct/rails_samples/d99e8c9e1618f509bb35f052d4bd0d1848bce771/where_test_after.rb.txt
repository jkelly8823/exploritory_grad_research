 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155 because it uses the where method with an empty array and hash, which can lead to a NULL check or trigger a missing WHERE clause. This is because the Active Record component and the JSON implementation do not properly consider differences in parameter handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using the where method with empty arrays and hashes.
- Use the where method with valid parameters to ensure that the database query is properly restricted.
- Consider using the where.not method to explicitly exclude certain values. 
- Always validate user input to prevent potential SQL injection attacks. 
- Regularly update and patch your Ruby on Rails version to ensure you have the latest security fixes.  ```bash
gem 'rails', '~> 4.2.0'
```
