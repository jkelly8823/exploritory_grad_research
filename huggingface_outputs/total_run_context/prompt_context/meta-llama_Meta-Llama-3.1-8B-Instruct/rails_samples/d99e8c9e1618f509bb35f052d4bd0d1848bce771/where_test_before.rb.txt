 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155 because it uses the `where` method with a blank value (`nil` or an empty string) as a parameter. This can lead to a NULL check or trigger a missing WHERE clause, allowing an attacker to bypass intended database-query restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use the `where` method with a valid condition that is not blank.
- Consider using the `where` method with a `not` condition to explicitly exclude blank values.
- Always validate user input to prevent such vulnerabilities.
