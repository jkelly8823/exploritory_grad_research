 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of the `..` (dot dot) in the `find_all` method. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files by providing a malicious path. The `find_all` method does not properly sanitize the input path, making it susceptible to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the input path by removing any `..` (dot dot) characters.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input path against a set of allowed paths.
3. Consider using a more secure method for resolving templates, such as using a template engine that is designed to prevent directory traversal attacks.
