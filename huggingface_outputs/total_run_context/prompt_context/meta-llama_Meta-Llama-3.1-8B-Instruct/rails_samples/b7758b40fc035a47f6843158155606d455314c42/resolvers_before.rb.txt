 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious directory traversal vulnerabilities. However, it does contain a potential vulnerability in the `query` method where it uses `Regexp.escape` to escape file extensions. This could potentially be used to inject malicious file extensions. To mitigate this, the code should be modified to use a whitelist of allowed file extensions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a whitelist of allowed file extensions to prevent malicious file extensions from being injected.
- Consider using a more secure method to handle file extensions, such as using a regular expression that only matches known file extensions. 
- Review the `NullResolver` class to ensure it is not vulnerable to any other potential issues.  ```
