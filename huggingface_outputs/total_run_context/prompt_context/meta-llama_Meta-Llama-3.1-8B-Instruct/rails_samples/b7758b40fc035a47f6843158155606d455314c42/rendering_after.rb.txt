 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious directory traversal vulnerabilities. The _normalize_args method checks if the action parameter is an ActionController::Parameters object and if it is not permitted, it raises an ArgumentError. This prevents any potential directory traversal attacks. However, it's worth noting that the render method is still vulnerable to directory traversal attacks if the action parameter is not an ActionController::Parameters object or if it is permitted. To fix this, the render method should be modified to only allow permitted parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Modify the render method to only allow permitted parameters.
- Consider using the strong_parameters gem to help with parameter validation. 
- Review the application's use of the render method to ensure it is not vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.  ```
