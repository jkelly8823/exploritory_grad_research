 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the use of the `find_file` and `find_all` methods, which do not properly sanitize the input `name` parameter. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a `name` parameter that contains a `..` (dot dot) sequence, which can be used to traverse the directory structure and access arbitrary files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the `name` parameter and only allow specific, expected values.
2. Use a library like `rails-anti-csrf` to help prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. Update the `find_file` and `find_all` methods to properly sanitize the `name` parameter using a method like `File.dirname` to remove any directory traversal sequences.
