VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious directory traversal vulnerabilities. The `find_all` method is using the `@view_paths.find_all` method, which is likely a part of the Rails framework and does not seem to be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. However, it's worth noting that the `args_for_lookup` method is not shown in this snippet, and if it's not properly sanitized, it could potentially lead to a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Review the `args_for_lookup` method to ensure it properly sanitizes any user-inputted values. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input parameters. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for finding templates, such as using a secure path resolution mechanism.  Consider using a tool like `rails-security` to scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a tool like `brakeman` to scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a tool like `bandit` to scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a tool like `bandit` to scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
