 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to directory traversal. However, the `find_template_paths` method uses `Dir[query]` which may be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks if the `query` is not properly sanitized. This could potentially allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the `query` variable in the `find_template_paths` method to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be done by using `File.expand_path` to ensure that the path is absolute and does not contain any `..` components.
2. Consider using a more secure method to find template paths, such as using a whitelist of allowed directories or using a library that is designed to handle path manipulation securely.
