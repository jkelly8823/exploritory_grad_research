 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of the `find_all_anywhere` method in the `_find_all` method. This method is called when `outside_app` is true, and it allows the attacker to specify a path that can traverse outside of the intended directory. The `path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious directory traversal characters (e.g., `..`).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the `path` parameter by removing any directory traversal characters (e.g., `..`) before passing it to the `find_all_anywhere` method.
2. Consider using a more secure method to resolve templates, such as using a whitelist of allowed directories or using a more secure path resolution algorithm.
3. Update the `find_all_anywhere` method to prevent directory traversal attacks by properly sanitizing the `path` parameter.
