 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The render method is being used with a string argument that contains a relative path. An attacker could potentially manipulate this path to access arbitrary files on the system by including directory traversal sequences (e.g., "..") in the path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the :partial option with a symbol instead of a string to prevent directory traversal attacks. For example, change the code to use `@view.render(:partial => :test_partial_only)` instead of `@view.render("test/partial_only")`. Additionally, consider using a whitelist of allowed partials to further restrict access.  ```ruby
    assert_equal "only partial", @view.render(:partial => :test_partial_only)
  end

  def test_render_partial
    assert_equal "only partial", @view.render(:partial => :test_partial_only)
  end
