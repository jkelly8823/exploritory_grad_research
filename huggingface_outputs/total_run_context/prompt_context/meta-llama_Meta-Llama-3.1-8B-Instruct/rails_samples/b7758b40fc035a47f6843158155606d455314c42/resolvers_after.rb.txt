 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of Regexp.escape on the file extensions. This allows an attacker to inject malicious file extensions by providing a specially crafted path. The NullResolver class does not properly sanitize the path, making it vulnerable to this attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the file extensions instead of using Regexp.escape.
2. Sanitize the path in the NullResolver class to prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to generate the template, such as using a secure template engine.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
