 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-6417 because it uses the EarlyParse middleware, which triggers a Rack parse to cache query parameters. This can lead to bypassing intended database-query restrictions and performing NULL checks or triggering missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the EarlyParse middleware from the application.
2. Use a more secure approach to handle query parameters, such as using a whitelist of allowed parameters.
3. Update the application to use a more secure version of Ruby on Rails, such as 3.2.16 or 4.0.2. 4. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent similar vulnerabilities. 5. Regularly review and update the application to ensure it remains secure. 6. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of security. 7. Implement a secure coding practice, such as code reviews and testing, to prevent similar vulnerabilities. 8. Use a secure configuration for the application, such as setting the secure flag on cookies and using HTTPS. 9. Regularly update dependencies and libraries to
