 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to CVE-2013-6417 because it does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation. This allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request. The code overrides Rack's GET and POST methods to support indifferent access, but it does not properly handle the differences in parameter handling, making it vulnerable to this attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle the differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation.
2. Use a secure method to handle parameters, such as using a parameter sanitizer or a library that provides secure parameter handling.
3. Consider using a more secure version of Ruby on Rails, such as version 4.0.2 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.  ```bash
