 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `gsub` method with a regular expression that does not properly escape HTML entities. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted Hash that is mishandled during JSON encoding.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `h` method to escape HTML entities properly.
2. Consider using a more robust library for JSON encoding, such as `json` gem.
3. Ensure that all user-input data is properly sanitized before encoding it as JSON.
