 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of ActiveSupport::JSON.encode on a hash with untrusted keys. The ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json flag is set to true, which allows the encoding of HTML entities in the JSON output. However, this can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted hash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json to false by default to prevent the encoding of HTML entities in the JSON output.
- Use a secure method to encode the hash keys, such as using a whitelist of allowed keys or using a secure encoding library like Rack::Utils.escape_html. 
- Consider using a more secure JSON encoding library like Oj or Yajl. 
- Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is not vulnerable to known security issues.  ```
