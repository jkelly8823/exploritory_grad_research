 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the gsub method with a regular expression that does not properly escape HTML entities. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted Hash that is mishandled during JSON encoding.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the gsub method with a safer alternative, such as the String#gsub! method with a regular expression that properly escapes HTML entities. Additionally, consider using a library like sanitize to properly escape user input.
