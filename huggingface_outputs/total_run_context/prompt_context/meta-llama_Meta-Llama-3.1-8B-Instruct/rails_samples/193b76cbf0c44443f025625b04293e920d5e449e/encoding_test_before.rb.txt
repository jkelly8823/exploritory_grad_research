 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of ActiveSupport::JSON.encode on a hash with untrusted keys. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted Hash that is mishandled during JSON encoding.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use ActiveSupport::JSON.decode to decode the JSON string before encoding it with ActiveSupport::JSON.encode. This will prevent the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML. Alternatively, use a library that is designed to handle JSON encoding and decoding securely, such as json gem.
