 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `escape_unsafe_delimiters_and_separators` method. The `html_escape` method is used to escape HTML special characters, but it does not prevent XSS attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. In this case, the `options[:unit]` parameter is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust sanitization method, such as `sanitize` from the `rails/html_sanitizer` gem, to ensure that user input is properly sanitized.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input and only allow specific characters or patterns.
3. Update the `html_escape` method to use a more secure version, such as `CGI.escapeHTML`, to prevent XSS attacks. VULNERABILITY LIST:
