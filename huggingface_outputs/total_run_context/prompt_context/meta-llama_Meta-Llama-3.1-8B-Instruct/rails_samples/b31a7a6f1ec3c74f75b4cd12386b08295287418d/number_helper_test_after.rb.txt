 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of the `raw` method in the `number_to_currency` function. The `raw` method does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This is a classic example of an XSS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `html_escape` method to sanitize the input before passing it to the `number_to_currency` function.
2. Avoid using the `raw` method, which does not provide any security guarantees.
3. Consider using a more secure method, such as `sanitize` or `strip_tags`, to remove any malicious HTML or JavaScript code from the input.
