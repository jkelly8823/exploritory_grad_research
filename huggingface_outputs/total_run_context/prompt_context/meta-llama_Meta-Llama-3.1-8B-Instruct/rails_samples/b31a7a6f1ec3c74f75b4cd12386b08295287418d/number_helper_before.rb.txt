 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of ERB::Util.html_escape, which is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks. The html_safe? method is used to check if the delimiter or separator is safe, but this method is not foolproof and can be bypassed by an attacker. A more robust solution would be to use a library like sanitize or a similar method that can properly sanitize user input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace ERB::Util.html_escape with a more robust sanitization method, such as sanitize from the rails-html-sanitizer gem.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure that only allowed characters are accepted. This can help prevent XSS attacks even if the sanitization method is bypassed. 
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest security best practices.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
