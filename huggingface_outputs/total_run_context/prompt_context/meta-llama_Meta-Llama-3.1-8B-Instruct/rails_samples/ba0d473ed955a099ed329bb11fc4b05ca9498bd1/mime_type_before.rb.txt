 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability due to the catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine caused by carefully crafted Accept headers. This is because the regular expression used in the Mime type parser does not properly handle certain input patterns, leading to an excessive amount of backtracking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Actionpack gem to version 6.0.3.7 or 6.1.3.2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a more robust regular expression that properly handles the input patterns and prevents catastrophic backtracking.
3. Implement input validation to prevent malicious input from reaching the regular expression engine. 
4. Consider using a more secure approach to parsing MIME types, such as using a dedicated library or module.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
