 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of `File.expand_path` in the `FileSystemResolver` constructor. This allows an attacker to traverse the file system by manipulating the path passed to the `FileSystemResolver`. The `available_action?` method also does not properly validate the action name, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files by providing a specially crafted action name.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to resolve file paths, such as `Pathname` or `URI`.
2. Validate the action name in the `available_action?` method to prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed file paths and action names.
