VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a test suite for the Active Record component in Ruby on Rails, specifically testing the behavior of the `where.not` method. Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any evidence of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-1854. The code is using the `where.not` method correctly, and the hash keys are not being converted to symbols in a way that would allow a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2013-1854. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and follow best practices for secure coding. 

Note: The code sample provided is a test suite and does not contain any actual application code that could be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1854. The vulnerability is related to how the `where` method is used in application code
