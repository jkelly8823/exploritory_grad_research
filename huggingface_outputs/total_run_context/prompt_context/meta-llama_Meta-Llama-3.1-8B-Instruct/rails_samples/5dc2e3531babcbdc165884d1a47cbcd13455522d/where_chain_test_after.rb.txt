 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1854. This vulnerability occurs when the Active Record component in Ruby on Rails processes certain queries by converting hash keys to symbols. In this code sample, the `where` method is used with a hash key that is not a symbol, which can lead to a denial of service attack. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is using the `not` method to negate the condition, which is a safe way to use the `where` method. The `not` method is used to create a negated condition, which is then passed to the `where` method. This is a safe way to use the `where` method and does not expose the code to the CVE-2013-1854 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code sample. The code is using the `not` method to negate the condition, which is a safe way to use the `where` method. However, it's always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is not vulnerable to any other potential issues. Additionally, it's recommended to keep the Ruby on Rails
