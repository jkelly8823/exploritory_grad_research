 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability CVE-2012-2660 is present in the provided code. This is because the code does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the Rack interface. The deep_munge method is used to remove nils from the params hash, but it does not handle the case where a parameter is an array containing a nil value. This allows an attacker to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks via a crafted request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the deep_munge method to handle the case where a parameter is an array containing a nil value.
2. Use a more robust method to remove nils from the params hash, such as using the reject method.
3. Consider using a library like Rack::Utils to handle parameter parsing and validation. 
VULNERABILITY LIST: 
```ruby
def deep_munge(hash)
  hash.each_value do |v|
    case v
    when Array
      v.grep(Hash) { |x| deep_munge(x) }
    when Hash
      deep_munge(v)
    end
  end

  keys = hash.keys.find_all { |
