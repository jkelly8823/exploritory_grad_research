 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-2660 because it does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the Rack interface. The code is testing for query string parameters with nil values, which can be used to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the code properly handles nil values in query string parameters.
- Consider using a more secure approach to handle query string parameters, such as using a whitelist of allowed parameters.
- Update the code to the latest version of Ruby on Rails to ensure that the vulnerability is patched.  ```ruby
