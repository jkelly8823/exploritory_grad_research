 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-28103 because it does not check the Content-Type of the response before setting the Feature Policy header. In the first test, the Content-Type is not explicitly set, which may lead to the Feature Policy header being set even if the response is not HTML-related. In the second test, the Content-Type is explicitly set to "application/json", which is not HTML-related, but the Feature Policy header is still set. This is a potential vulnerability because an attacker could exploit this to set a malicious Feature Policy header on non-HTML responses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the Content-Type of the response before setting the Feature Policy header.
2. Only set the Feature Policy header on responses with an HTML-related Content-Type.
3. Update the code to use the latest version of Action Pack that fixes this vulnerability.
