 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code checks for the presence of an HTML related Content-Type in the response headers and only sets the Permissions-Policy header if it is present. Additionally, the code checks for existing policies and does not overwrite them. The vulnerability described in CVE-2024-28103 is related to the application of the Permissions-Policy header in Action Pack, but the code sample provided does not seem to be applying the header in a way that would be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue and does not require any changes to address the vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code to ensure it is secure and follows best practices.  The code could be improved by adding more robust testing and validation of the response headers.  Additionally, the code could be improved by following the principle of least privilege and only setting the Permissions-Policy header when necessary.  However, these are general recommendations and not specific to the described vulnerability.  The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described
