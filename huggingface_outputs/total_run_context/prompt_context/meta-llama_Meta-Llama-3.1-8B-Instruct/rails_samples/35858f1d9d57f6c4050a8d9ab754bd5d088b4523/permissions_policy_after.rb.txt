 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-28103 because it does not check the Content-Type of the response before checking for the Permissions-Policy header. This allows an attacker to bypass the check by sending a request with a non-HTML related Content-Type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the Content-Type of the response before checking for the Permissions-Policy header.
2. Use a more secure method to check for the Permissions-Policy header, such as using a whitelist of allowed headers.
3. Update the application to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue, such as 6.1.7.8, 7.0.8.2, or 7.1.3.3.  ```python
def call(env):
    _, headers, _ = response = @app.call(env)

    if headers.get('Content-Type') not in ['text/html', 'application/xhtml+xml']:
        return response

    return response if policy_present?(headers)

def policy_present?(headers):
    return headers.get(ActionDispatch::Constants::FEATURE_POLICY)
```
