 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-28103 because it does not properly handle the Permissions-Policy header. The `policy_present?` method checks if the header is present, but it does not check if the header is only served on responses with an HTML related Content-Type. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious Permissions-Policy header in a non-HTML response, potentially leading to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `policy_present?` method to check if the Content-Type is HTML before checking for the Permissions-Policy header.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed headers, to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
