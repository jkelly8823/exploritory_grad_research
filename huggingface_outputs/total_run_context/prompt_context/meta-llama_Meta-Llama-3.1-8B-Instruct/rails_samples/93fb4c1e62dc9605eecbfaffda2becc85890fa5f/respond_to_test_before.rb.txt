 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. This is because the application does not properly restrict the SWF file format, allowing a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content to be used to obtain sensitive information via a JSONP endpoint. The test_json_with_callback method is specifically vulnerable as it sets the response content type to 'text/javascript' which can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the content type of the response to ensure it is not 'text/javascript' or any other type that can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
2. Implement a proper validation of the SWF file format to prevent the execution of malicious code.
3. Use a secure method to handle JSONP endpoints, such as using a secure callback function name or validating the callback function name.
