 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack due to the improper restriction of the SWF file format. The code allows a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content to satisfy the character-set requirements of a callback API, which can be used to obtain sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the callback parameter to ensure it only accepts expected values.
2. Implement a CSRF token to prevent unauthorized requests.
3. Use a secure method to generate the JSON response, such as using a secure random number generator. 
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against CSRF attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
