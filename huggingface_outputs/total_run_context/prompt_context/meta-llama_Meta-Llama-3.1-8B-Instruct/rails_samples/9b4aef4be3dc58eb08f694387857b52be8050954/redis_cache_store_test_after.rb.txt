 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that would allow for deserialization of untrusted data. The code is a simple wrapper around the `super` method, which suggests that it is calling the parent class's implementation of the `get` method. There is no indication that any untrusted data is being deserialized or unmarshaled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it's worth noting that the use of `sleep 3` in the code may have performance implications and could potentially be a bottleneck in a high-traffic application. Consider removing this line or replacing it with a more efficient solution.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-8165
CVE Description:
A deserialization of untrusted data vulnernerability exists in rails < 5.2.4.3, rails < 6.0.0.1 that can allow an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects in MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore potentially resulting in an RCE.

Code Sample:
  def initialize
    @cache = Redis.new
  end
