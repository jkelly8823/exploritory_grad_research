VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. This is because the `deserialize_entry` method is used to deserialize user-provided objects, which can potentially lead to an RCE. The `deserialize_entry` method uses `Marshal.load` to deserialize the object, which can execute arbitrary code if the object is maliciously crafted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer deserialization method, such as `JSON.parse` or `YAML.safe_load`, to deserialize user-provided objects.
2. Validate the input data before deserializing it to prevent malicious objects from being deserialized.
3. Consider using a library like `safe_yaml` to safely deserialize YAML data.
4. Remove the `Marshal.load` call and instead use a safer method to deserialize the object.
