EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. This is because the `deserialize_entry` method is used to deserialize user-provided objects, which can potentially lead to an RCE. The `deserialize_entry` method uses `Marshal.load(serialized_entry)` to deserialize the object, which can execute arbitrary code if the serialized entry is crafted maliciously. Additionally, the `deserialize_entry` method is called with user-provided data in the `read_entry` and `read_multi_entries` methods, which can also lead to an RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safe deserialization method, such as `JSON.parse` or `YAML.safe_load`, instead of `Marshal.load`.
2. Validate and sanitize user-provided data before passing it to the `deserialize_entry` method.
3. Consider using a more secure caching strategy, such as using a secure cache store like Redis with a secure deserialization mechanism.
