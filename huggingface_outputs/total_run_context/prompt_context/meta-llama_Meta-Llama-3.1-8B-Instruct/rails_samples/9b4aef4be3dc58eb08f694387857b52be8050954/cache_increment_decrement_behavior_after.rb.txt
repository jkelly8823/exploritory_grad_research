 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. The code is using the `raw: true` option when writing and reading from the cache, which prevents the deserialization of untrusted data. Additionally, the code is not using the `increment` or `decrement` methods on untrusted data, which is the primary attack vector for this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this CVE and does not require any changes to fix it. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and follow secure coding practices to prevent other potential vulnerabilities.
