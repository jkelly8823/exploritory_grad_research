 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the `force_encoding` method to encode user-provided data, which can lead to deserialization of untrusted data. The `force_encoding` method can be used to bypass the encoding checks in the `MemCacheStore` and `RedisCacheStore` classes, potentially allowing an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Rails version to 5.2.4.3 or later, or 6.0.3.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use the `encode` method instead of `force_encoding` to encode user-provided data.
3. Validate user-provided data to ensure it conforms to expected encoding and format.
