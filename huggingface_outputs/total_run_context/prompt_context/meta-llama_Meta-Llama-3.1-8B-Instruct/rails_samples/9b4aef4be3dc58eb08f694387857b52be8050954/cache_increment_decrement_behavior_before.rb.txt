 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any direct deserialization of untrusted data. However, it does use the `write` method with the `raw: true` option, which bypasses Rails' default serialization and deserialization of cache values. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the cache, which could then be deserialized by the `read` method. This is a potential vulnerability, but it is not directly related to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using the `raw: true` option when writing to the cache, as it bypasses Rails' default serialization and deserialization.
- Use the `write` method with the `raw: false` option to ensure that cache values are properly serialized and deserialized.
- Consider using a more secure caching solution, such as Redis or Memcached, which have built-in support for secure deserialization.
