 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. The code is using the `raw: true` option when writing to the cache, which prevents the use of the `write` method for storing untrusted data. Additionally, the code is using the `increment`, `decrement`, and `read_multi` methods, which do not involve deserialization of untrusted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the `raw: true` option is used consistently throughout the code to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
