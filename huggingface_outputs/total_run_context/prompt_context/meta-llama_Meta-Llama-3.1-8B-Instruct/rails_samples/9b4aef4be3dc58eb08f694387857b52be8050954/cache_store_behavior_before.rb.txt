 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. The code is using the `raw: true` option when writing to the cache, which prevents the deserialization of untrusted data. Additionally, the code is using the `fetch` method with a block, which also prevents the deserialization of untrusted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to use the latest version of Rails.
