 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any deserialization of untrusted data. The cache operations are performed using the `write`, `increment`, `read`, `decrement`, and `read_multi` methods, which do not involve deserialization of user-provided objects. The `raw: true` option is used to bypass the default serialization, but it is not used to deserialize untrusted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is safe from the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to keep the `raw: true` option usage to a minimum and only use it when necessary, as it can potentially lead to other security issues if not used correctly.  ```
