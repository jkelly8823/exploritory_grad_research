 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. The code is using the `force_encoding` method to ensure that the key is encoded in the specified encoding, which prevents the deserialization of untrusted data. Additionally, the code is using the `raw: true` option when writing and reading from the cache, which also prevents the deserialization of untrusted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-8165 vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228

Code Sample:
    def log4j_config
      config = Log4j::Config::Builder.new
      config.add_appender(:console, Log4j::App
