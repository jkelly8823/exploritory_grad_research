 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the improper restriction of the MIME type cache. This is because the `Regexp.new(Regexp.quote(mime_type.to_s))` line does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious HTTP Accept header that can cause the system to consume excessive memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to sanitize the input, such as `URI::parse(mime_type.to_s).path` to extract the path from the URI.
2. Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent excessive memory consumption.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve MIME types, such as a database or a secure cache.
