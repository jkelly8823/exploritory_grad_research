 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the improper restriction of the MIME type cache. This is because the `lookup` method does not properly validate the input string, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a crafted HTTP Accept header.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input string in the `lookup` method to ensure it conforms to a specific format or pattern.
2. Consider using a more robust caching mechanism, such as a hash table with a fixed size, to prevent memory consumption.
3. Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse of the `lookup` method.
