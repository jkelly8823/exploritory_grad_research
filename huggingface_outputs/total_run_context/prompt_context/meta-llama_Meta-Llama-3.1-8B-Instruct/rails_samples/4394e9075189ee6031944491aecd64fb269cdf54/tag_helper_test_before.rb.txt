 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the raw method which does not properly sanitize the input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via text declared as "HTML safe" and used as attribute values in tag handlers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the html_safe method instead of raw to properly sanitize the input. For example, replace raw("song>") with html_safe("song>"). Additionally, consider using a whitelist of allowed attributes and values to further prevent XSS attacks.
