 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `html_safe` method on a string that contains a double quote. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via text declared as "HTML safe" and used as attribute values in tag handlers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the `html_safe` method on strings that contain special characters like double quotes.
2. Use the `h` method to escape the string before passing it to the `html_safe` method.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle attribute values, such as using a whitelist of allowed attributes.
