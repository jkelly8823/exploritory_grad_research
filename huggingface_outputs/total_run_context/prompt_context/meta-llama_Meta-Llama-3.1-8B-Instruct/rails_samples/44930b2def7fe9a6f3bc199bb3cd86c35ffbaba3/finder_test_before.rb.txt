 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack. This is because the `find` method is being called with a parameter that is not properly sanitized. In this case, the `1` is a hardcoded value, but if it were a user-provided input, it could potentially be manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the `find_by_id` method instead of `find` to prevent potential SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using a more robust method for retrieving data, such as `find_by` or `where`. If you must use `find`, make sure to properly sanitize any user-provided input. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
1. SQL Injection Attack 
    - Description: A SQL injection attack occurs when an attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application's database to extract or modify sensitive data. 
    - Severity: High 
    - Remediation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Hardcoded Credentials 
    - Description: Hardcoded credentials are stored directly in the code, making them easily
