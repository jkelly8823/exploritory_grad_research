VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of hash parameters in the find_by_id and find_by_title_and_id methods. The hash parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the find_by_id and find_by_title_and_id methods with a single argument, which is the ID of the record to be found. This will prevent the use of hash parameters and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
2. Use the find method with a single argument, which is the ID of the record to be found. This will also prevent the use of hash parameters and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
3. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be achieved by using the find_by_id and find_by_title_and_id methods with a single argument, and then using the? placeholder to pass the ID as a parameter.
4. Consider using an ORM like ActiveRecord that provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks. In this case, the use of hash parameters in the find_by_id and
