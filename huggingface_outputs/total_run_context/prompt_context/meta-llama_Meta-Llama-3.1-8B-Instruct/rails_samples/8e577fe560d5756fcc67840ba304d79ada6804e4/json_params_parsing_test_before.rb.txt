 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155 because it does not properly sanitize the JSON input. The variable 'json' is assigned a string that contains a syntax error, which can be exploited to bypass database-query restrictions. This is a classic example of a JSON injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into the system.
- Use a JSON parser that can handle and sanitize user input, such as the 'json' gem.
- Ensure that the JSON input is properly formatted and does not contain any syntax errors.  ```ruby
    )
  end

  test "logs error if parsing unsuccessful" do
    with_test_routing do
      output = StringIO.new
      json = "[\"person]\": {\"name\": \"David\"}}" # <--- Syntax error here
