 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be exploited by the CVE-2019-5420 vulnerability. The code snippet is a comment explaining how Rails handles secret key bases in different environments. It does not contain any code that could be used to guess the development mode secret token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5420 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the application's secret key base is properly configured and stored securely in all environments. This can be done by following the Rails documentation on secret key base management.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5420
CVE Description:
A remote code execution vulnerability in development mode Rails <5.2.2.1, <6.0.0.beta3 can allow an attacker to guess the automatically generated development mode secret token. This secret token can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a remote code execution exploit.

Code Sample:
    def authenticate_user_from_token(user_email)
      token = params[:login_token]
      user = User.find_by(email: user_email
