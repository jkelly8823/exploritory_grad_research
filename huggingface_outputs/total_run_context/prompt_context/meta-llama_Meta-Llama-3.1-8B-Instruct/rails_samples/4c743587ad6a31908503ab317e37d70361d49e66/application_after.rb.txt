 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5420 because it generates a secret key in development mode and stores it in a file. This secret key can be guessed by an attacker, allowing them to escalate to a remote code execution exploit. The vulnerability is present in the `generate_development_secret` method, which is called when the application is in development or test mode.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store the secret key in an environment variable instead of generating it in the code.
2. Use a secure method to generate the secret key, such as using a secure random number generator.
3. Do not store the secret key in a file that can be accessed by an attacker.
4. Consider using a secrets manager to securely store and manage sensitive data.  ```ruby
# Instead of generating the secret key in the code, store it in an environment variable
# SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key_base rails s

# Use a secure method to generate the secret key
# require'securerandom'
# secrets.secret_key_base = SecureRandom.hex(64)

# Do not store the secret key in a file
# secrets.secret_key_base
