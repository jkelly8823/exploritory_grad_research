 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5420 because it does not properly handle the secret token in development mode. The secret token is automatically generated and can be guessed by an attacker, allowing them to escalate to a remote code execution exploit.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the secret token is properly generated and stored in a secure manner.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent an attacker from guessing the secret token.
3. Update Rails to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2019-5420. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to generate and store the secret token, such as using a secure random number generator. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
