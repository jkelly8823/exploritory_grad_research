EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to guess the development mode secret token. The secret token is generated automatically by Rails and is not directly accessible from the provided code. However, it is worth noting that the code is in development mode, which is a potential security risk. It is recommended to switch to production mode or use a more secure configuration.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Switch to production mode by setting `config.environment = 'production'` in the `config/application.rb` file.
- Use a more secure configuration by setting `config.secret_key_base` to a secure random value. 
- Consider using a more secure session store, such as `:encrypted_cookie_store`. 
- Make sure to follow best practices for secure configuration and deployment.  ```ruby
# config/application.rb
module Myapp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.environment = 'production'
    config.secret_key_base = 'your_secret_key_here'
  end
end
``` ```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  config.session_store :encrypted_cookie_store
end
``` ```ruby
# config
