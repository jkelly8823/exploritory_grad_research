 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to guess the development mode secret token. The secret key base is either derived from the application name in test and development environments or stored encrypted in the config/credentials.yml.enc file. This makes it difficult for an attacker to guess the secret token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet is secure in this regard. However, it is recommended to ensure that the secret key base is properly stored and managed in all environments to prevent potential vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by using a secure key management system and following best practices for secret key storage.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5420
CVE Description:
A remote code execution vulnerability in development mode Rails <5.2.2.1, <6.0.0.beta3 can allow an attacker to guess the automatically generated development mode secret token. This secret token can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a remote code execution exploit.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END  END
