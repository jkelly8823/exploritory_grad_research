 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5420 vulnerability. The secret key base is explicitly set to a fixed value, which would prevent an attacker from guessing the secret token. Additionally, the code is not in development mode, as indicated by the log level being set to :info, which is not a development mode setting.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep the secret key base secure and not hardcode it in the code. Consider using environment variables or a secrets manager to store sensitive information like the secret key base.  ```ruby
# Using environment variables
@app.secrets.secret_key_base = ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE']

# Using a secrets manager
@app.secrets.secret_key_base = Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base
