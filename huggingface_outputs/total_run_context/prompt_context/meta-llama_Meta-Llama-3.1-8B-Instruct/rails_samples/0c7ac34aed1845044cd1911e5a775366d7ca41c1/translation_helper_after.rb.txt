 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `content_tag` method to generate a span element with user-controlled content. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted string that triggers generation of a fallback string by the i18n gem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to sanitize user input before passing it to the `content_tag` method.
2. Consider using a more secure method to generate the span element, such as using a template engine or a dedicated HTML escaping library.
3. Update the i18n gem to the latest version, which includes fixes for this vulnerability.
