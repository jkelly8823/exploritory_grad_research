 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `I18n.expects(:translate)` method, which can be used to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This is because the `translate` method is called with a string that is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize the input string before passing it to the `translate` method. This can be done by using the `sanitize` method provided by the `ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper` class. For example:
```ruby
I18n.expects(:translate).with(:foo, :locale => 'en', :raise=>true).returns("")
translate :foo, :locale => 'en', :sanitize => true
```
Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a whitelist approach to ensure that only allowed characters are passed to the `translate` method. For example:
```ruby
I18n.expects(:translate).with(:foo, :locale => 'en', :raise=>true).returns("")
translate :foo,
