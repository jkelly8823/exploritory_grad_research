 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `I18n.expects(:translate)` method, which can be used to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This is because the `translate` method is called with a string that is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure that only expected characters are passed to the `translate` method.
2. Consider using a library like `sanitize` to sanitize the input string before passing it to the `translate` method.
3. Update the `I18n` gem to the latest version, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
