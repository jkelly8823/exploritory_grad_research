 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `html_safe` method in the `translate` method. This method allows the execution of arbitrary web script or HTML, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code. The `html_safe` method is used to mark a string as safe to be inserted into the HTML document, but it does not perform any sanitization or validation of the input. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious code, such as JavaScript, into the HTML document.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `html_safe` method from the `translate` method.
2. Use a sanitization library, such as `sanitize`, to sanitize the input before inserting it into the HTML document.
3. Use a validation library, such as `validates`, to validate the input before inserting it into the HTML document.
4. Consider using a template engine, such as ERb, to render the HTML document, which can help to prevent XSS attacks.
