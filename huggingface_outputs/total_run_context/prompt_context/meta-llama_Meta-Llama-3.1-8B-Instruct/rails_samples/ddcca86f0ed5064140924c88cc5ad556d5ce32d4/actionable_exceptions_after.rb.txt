 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a possible XSS vulnerability due to the use of ERB::Util.unwrapped_html_escape(location) in the redirect_to method. This method does not properly escape all characters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This vulnerability is particularly concerning when the application is running in development mode, as it allows an attacker to send or embed a specially crafted URL which can allow the attacker to execute JavaScript in the context of the local application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more secure method to escape the location parameter, such as ERB::Util.html_escape(location).
- Consider using a more secure redirect method, such as the redirect_to method provided by the Rails framework, which properly escapes the location parameter.
- Ensure that the application is running in production mode when possible, as this vulnerability is mitigated in production mode.
