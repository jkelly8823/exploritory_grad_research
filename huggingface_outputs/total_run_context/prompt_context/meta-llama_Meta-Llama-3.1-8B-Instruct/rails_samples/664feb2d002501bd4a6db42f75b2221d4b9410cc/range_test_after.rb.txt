 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper range quoting in the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record in Ruby on Rails. The `PostgresqlRange.create!` and `PostgresqlRange.update_all` methods do not properly escape user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is evident in the `test_ranges_correctly_escape_input` method where an error is raised when attempting to update a range with a malicious input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the PostgreSQL adapter to properly escape user input.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
