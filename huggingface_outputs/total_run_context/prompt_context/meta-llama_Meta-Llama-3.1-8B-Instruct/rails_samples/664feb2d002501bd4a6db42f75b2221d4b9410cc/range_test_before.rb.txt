 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper range quoting in the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record in Ruby on Rails. The `PostgresqlRange.create!` method is called with a float range that includes an unquoted closing parenthesis, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the PostgreSQL adapter to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g., Active Record 4.0.7 or 4.1.3 or later).
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into the database. 
- Consider using a more secure database library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```ruby

CVE Description:
The `assert_equal_round_trip` method in Active Record in Ruby on Rails 4.2.x before 4.2.8 and 5.x before 5.0.0.1 allows remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted range value, which is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL
