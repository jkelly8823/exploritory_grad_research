 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper quoting of the range. The attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the range string. The PostgreSQLColumn.new method is not properly sanitizing the input, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the PostgreSQLColumn.new method.
- Update the PostgreSQL adapter to properly quote the range. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3483
CVE Description: SQL injection vulnerability in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/quoting.rb in the PostgreSQL adapter for Active Record in Ruby on Rails 4.x before 4.0.7 and 4.1.x before 4.1.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands by leveraging improper range quoting.  ```python
def test_quote_range
  range = "1,2]'; SELECT * FROM users; --".."a"
  c = PostgreSQLColumn.new(nil, nil, OID::Range.new(Type::Integer.new, :int8range))
