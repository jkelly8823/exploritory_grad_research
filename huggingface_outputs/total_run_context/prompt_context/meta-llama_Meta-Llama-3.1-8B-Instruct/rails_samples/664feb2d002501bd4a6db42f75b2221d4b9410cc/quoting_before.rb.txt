 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of the `quote_string` method, which does not properly sanitize user input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `value` parameter. Specifically, the `range_to_string` method is called on the `value` parameter without any validation or sanitization, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize the `value` parameter before passing it to the `range_to_string` method.
3. Consider using a more secure method, such as `quote` or `quote_value`, to properly escape user input.
