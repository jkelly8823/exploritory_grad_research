 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of the `quote_string` method which does not properly sanitize the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `value` parameter. The `quote_string` method is not designed to handle SQL syntax, and its use in this context can lead to a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `quote` method instead of `quote_string` to properly sanitize the input.
2. Validate the input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3. Consider using a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
