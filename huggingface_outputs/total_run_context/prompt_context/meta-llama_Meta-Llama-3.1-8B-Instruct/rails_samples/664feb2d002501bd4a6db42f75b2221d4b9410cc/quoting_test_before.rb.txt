 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the improper quoting of the range. The attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the range string. The `quote` method does not properly sanitize the input, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the database.
3. Update the `quote` method to properly handle and sanitize the input range.
