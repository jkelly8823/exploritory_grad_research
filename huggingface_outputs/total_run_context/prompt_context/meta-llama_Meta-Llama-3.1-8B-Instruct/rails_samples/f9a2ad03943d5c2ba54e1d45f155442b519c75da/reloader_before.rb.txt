 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability CVE-2022-23633 is related to the Action Pack framework in Rails, which can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests due to unclosed response bodies. However, the provided code snippet does not directly involve the Action Pack framework or response bodies. Nevertheless, the vulnerability is still relevant because the code is part of the Rails framework, and the fix for this vulnerability is included in Rails versions 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Since the code is likely running in one of these versions, it is vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a fixed version of Rails (7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, or 5.2.6.1) to resolve the vulnerability.
2. If upgrading is not feasible, apply the middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 to work around the issue.  ```
