 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-23633 vulnerability because it uses the Action Pack framework, which is susceptible to the issue described in the vulnerability. The `prepare!` method is called, but there is no indication that the response body is being closed, which can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade to Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, or 5.2.6.1 to fix the issue. Alternatively, use the middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 to work around the problem. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-23633
CVE Description:
Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This has been fixed in Rails 7.
