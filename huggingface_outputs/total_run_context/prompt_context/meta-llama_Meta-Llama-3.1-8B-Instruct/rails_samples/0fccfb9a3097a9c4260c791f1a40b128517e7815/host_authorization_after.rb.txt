 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability. The `sanitize_string` method does not properly validate the input, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious "X-Forwarded-Host" header. The `authorized?` method then uses this sanitized string to check if the request is authorized, which can lead to a redirect to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust validation method, such as a whitelist approach, to ensure that only valid hostnames are accepted.
2. Use a library like `uri` to parse the hostname and validate its components.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a secure cookie or token-based authentication, to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
