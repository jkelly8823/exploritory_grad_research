 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the way it handles the "X-Forwarded-Host" header. The `VALID_FORWARDED_HOST` regular expression allows an attacker to craft a malicious "X-Forwarded-Host" header that can cause the Host Authorization middleware to redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `VALID_FORWARDED_HOST` regular expression to prevent the open redirect vulnerability. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the forwarded host is not a subdomain of the origin host.
2. Consider using a more secure approach to handling the "X-Forwarded-Host" header, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts or IP addresses. This can help prevent open redirect vulnerabilities and other types of attacks. 
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest security best practices.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
