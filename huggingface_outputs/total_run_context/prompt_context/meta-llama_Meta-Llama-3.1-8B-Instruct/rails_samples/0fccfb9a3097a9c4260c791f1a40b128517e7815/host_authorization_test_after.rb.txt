 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the way it handles the "X-Forwarded-Host" header. An attacker can craft a malicious "X-Forwarded-Host" header that can cause the Host Authorization middleware to redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "X-Forwarded-Host" header to ensure it matches the expected format and does not contain any malicious characters.
2. Implement a whitelist of allowed hosts to prevent unauthorized redirects.
3. Use a secure method to handle redirects, such as using a secure protocol (HTTPS) and verifying the authenticity of the redirect URL. 
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against open redirect vulnerabilities. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 
6. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as IP blocking or rate limiting, to further protect against potential attacks. 
7. Ensure that the code is properly tested and validated to ensure that it functions as expected and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities. 
8. Consider using a security-focused testing framework to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure
