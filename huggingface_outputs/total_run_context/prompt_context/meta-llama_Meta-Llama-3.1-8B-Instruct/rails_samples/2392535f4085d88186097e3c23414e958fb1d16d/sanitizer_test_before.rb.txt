 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the presence of JavaScript code in the image source attribute. The code attempts to sanitize the input using the HTML::WhiteListSanitizer, but it does not properly handle the encoded newline characters and JavaScript code. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be executed by the browser.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the sanitize_css method to properly handle newline characters and JavaScript code.
2. Use a more robust sanitization library, such as OWASP's ESAPI, to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious code from being injected into the application. 
4. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within a web page. This can help prevent XSS attacks by specifying which scripts are allowed to run. 5. Regularly update and patch the application to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed. 6. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent XSS attacks. 7. Use a secure coding practice, such as input validation and sanitization
