 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1857. The sanitize helper in the code does not properly handle encoded : (colon) characters in URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted scheme name. This is evident in the regular expression used to match the protocol separator, which includes the encoded colon character (&#0*58) and the hexadecimal representation of the colon character (&#x70). Additionally, the code does not properly validate the protocol separator in the contains_bad_protocols? method, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code by crafting a URL with an encoded colon character.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the regular expression used to match the protocol separator to properly handle encoded colon characters. For example, you can use the following regular expression: /\A[:|&#58;|&#x3a;|%3A]\z/i
2. Validate the protocol separator in the contains_bad_protocols? method to ensure that it does not contain any encoded colon characters. For example, you can add the following check: value =~ /\A[:|&#58;|&#
