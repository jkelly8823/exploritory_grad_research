 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1854 because it processes certain queries by converting hash keys to symbols. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted input to a where method. The line that is vulnerable is line 9, where the code converts the foreign key to a symbol using the to_sym method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method to handle hash keys, such as using the to_s method instead of to_sym.
- Validate user input to prevent denial of service attacks. 
- Consider using a more secure query builder to prevent this type of vulnerability.  ```
