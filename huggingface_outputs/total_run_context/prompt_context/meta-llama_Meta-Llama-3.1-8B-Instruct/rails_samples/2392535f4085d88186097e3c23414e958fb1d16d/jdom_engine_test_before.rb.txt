 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an XML expansion attack due to the lack of proper entity handling in the JDOM backend. The attack_xml string contains a series of entity declarations that can be used to expand the XML document and potentially cause a denial of service or read arbitrary files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more secure XML parser, such as the REXML backend, which is not vulnerable to this type of attack.
- Ensure that the JDOM backend is properly configured to prevent entity expansion attacks.
- Consider upgrading to a newer version of Ruby on Rails that includes a fix for this vulnerability.  ``` VULNERABLE: YES
