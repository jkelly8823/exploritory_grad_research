 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1856 because it uses the JDOM backend for XML parsing, which is known to be vulnerable to XML external entity attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service by including an external DTD or entity declaration in the XML input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a newer version of Ruby on Rails that includes a fix for this vulnerability.
- Consider using a different XML parsing backend, such as the DOM backend, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
- Ensure that any external XML input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
