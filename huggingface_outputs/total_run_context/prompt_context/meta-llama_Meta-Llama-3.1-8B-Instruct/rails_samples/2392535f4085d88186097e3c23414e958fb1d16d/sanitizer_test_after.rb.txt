 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the presence of unsanitized JavaScript code in the image source attribute. The code attempts to sanitize the input using the `sanitize_css` method, but it does not properly handle encoded characters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `sanitize_css` method to properly handle encoded characters.
2. Use a more robust sanitization library, such as HTML::WhiteListSanitizer, to sanitize the input.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious code from being injected.
