 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-1854 due to the processing of certain queries by converting hash keys to symbols. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via crafted input to a where method.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method to handle hash keys, such as using a hash with string keys instead of symbols.
- Validate user input to prevent crafted input from being passed to the where method. 
- Consider upgrading to a version of Ruby on Rails that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```
