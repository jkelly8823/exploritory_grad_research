EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XML entity expansion attacks. The XmlMini JDOM backend does not properly restrict the capabilities of the XML parser, allowing remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via vectors involving external DTDs or external entity declarations in conjunction with entity references.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the XmlMini JDOM backend to a version that properly restricts the capabilities of the XML parser.
2. Use a different backend, such as the Nokogiri backend, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as whitelisting allowed entity expansions or using a secure XML parser.  ```bash
