EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the sanitize_css method not properly handling newline characters. This allows an attacker to craft Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences that can be used to inject malicious code. Additionally, the contains_bad_protocols? method does not properly restrict the capabilities of the XML parser, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via vectors involving an external DTD or an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the sanitize_css method to properly handle newline characters.
2. Update the contains_bad_protocols? method to properly restrict the capabilities of the XML parser.
3. Use a more secure method to sanitize user input, such as using a library like sanitize or html-safe. 
4. Regularly update dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches. 
5. Implement a Content Security Policy (C
