 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of a regular expression to escape the backslash character. The regular expression `/\//` is used to match the backslash character, but it does not account for the possibility of a backslash character being escaped itself. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by escaping the backslash character.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to escape the backslash character, such as using a character class `[/\\]/` to match both the backslash and escaped backslash characters.
2. Consider using a library or framework that provides a built-in method for escaping SQL input, such as the `pg` gem in Ruby.
3. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
