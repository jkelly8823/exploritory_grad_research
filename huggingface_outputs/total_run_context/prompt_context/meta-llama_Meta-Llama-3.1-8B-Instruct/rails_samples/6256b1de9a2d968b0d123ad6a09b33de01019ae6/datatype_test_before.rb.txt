 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any SQL injection vulnerability. The code is using the `delete_all` method on a list of model classes, which is a safe operation. The `column_for_attribute` method is also used to retrieve the type of a column, which does not involve any user input or SQL queries.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is safe and does not require any changes.  ```
