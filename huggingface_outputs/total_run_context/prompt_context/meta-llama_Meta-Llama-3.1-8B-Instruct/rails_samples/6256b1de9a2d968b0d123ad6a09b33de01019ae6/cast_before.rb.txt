 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of string concatenation in the quote_and_escape method. This method does not properly handle the escaping of special characters, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the use of the gsub method to replace double quotes with escaped double quotes may not be sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a parameterized query or an ORM that properly escapes user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Use a library like ActiveRecord's built-in parameter escaping or a library like sanitize to properly escape user input.
3. Avoid using string concatenation to build SQL queries, and instead use a query builder or a library that properly escapes user input.
