 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTML injection attacks. The `bytesplice` and `insert` methods are not properly sanitizing the input values, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML code. The `implicit_html_escape_interpolated_argument` method is not being called correctly, which is intended to escape any HTML special characters in the input values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call the `implicit_html_escape_interpolated_argument` method correctly by passing the `value` argument to it.
2. Use a more robust HTML escaping library, such as `ERB::Util` or `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer`, to ensure that all HTML special characters are properly escaped.
