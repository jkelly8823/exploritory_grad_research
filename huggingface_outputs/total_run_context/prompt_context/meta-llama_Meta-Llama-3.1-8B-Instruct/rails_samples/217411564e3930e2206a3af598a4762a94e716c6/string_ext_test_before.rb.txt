RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and follows best practices for testing in Rails. However, it's always a good idea to keep your dependencies up to date and to use a secure random number generator when generating secrets.  The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, but it's always a good idea to review the code and consider potential security risks.  Consider using a linter or code analyzer to identify potential issues.  Consider using a code review process to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices.  Consider using a secure coding guide to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices.  Consider using a secure coding standard to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices.  Consider using a secure coding tool to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices.  Consider using a secure coding framework to
