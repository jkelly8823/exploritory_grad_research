 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the sanitize_css method not properly handling newline characters. However, the provided code sample does not directly utilize the sanitize_css method. Instead, it attempts to sanitize the CSS by removing URLs and checking for valid CSS syntax. Nevertheless, the code is still vulnerable to XSS attacks because it does not properly validate the CSS properties and values. Specifically, the code allows for the use of untrusted data in the CSS properties and values, which can lead to XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust CSS sanitization library that properly handles newline characters and other special characters.
2. Validate the CSS properties and values to ensure they only contain trusted data.
3. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific CSS properties and values.
4. Consider using a CSS parser library to parse and validate the CSS code.
