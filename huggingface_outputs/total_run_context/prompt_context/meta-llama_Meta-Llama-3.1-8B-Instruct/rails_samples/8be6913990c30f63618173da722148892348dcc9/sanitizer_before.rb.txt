 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the sanitize_css method not properly handling newline characters. However, the provided code snippet does not directly use the sanitize_css method. Instead, it attempts to sanitize the CSS style by removing URLs and checking for valid CSS syntax. Nevertheless, the regular expressions used in the code may not be sufficient to prevent XSS attacks. The code also allows for the use of certain CSS keywords that may be used to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust CSS sanitizer library that can handle newline characters and other potential XSS vectors.
2. Update the regular expressions to prevent the use of certain CSS keywords that may be used to inject malicious code.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific CSS properties and values. This can help prevent XSS attacks by ensuring that only known-safe CSS is used. 
4. Regularly review and update the allowed CSS keywords to ensure they are not being used for malicious purposes. 5. Consider using a more secure method to handle CSS styles, such as using a templating engine that can safely escape user-input CSS. 6. Use
