 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the sanitize_css method not properly handling newline characters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious CSS code by crafting token sequences that include newline characters. The test cases provided demonstrate this vulnerability, where the sanitize_css method fails to remove the malicious CSS code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the sanitize_css method to properly handle newline characters.
2. Use a more robust CSS sanitizer library that can handle a wide range of CSS token sequences.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent XSS attacks.  ```ruby
def sanitize_css(css)
  # Update the method to properly handle newline characters
  css.gsub(/\n/, '')
end
```  ```ruby
# Use a more robust CSS sanitizer library
require 'css-sanitizer'
def sanitize_css(css)
  CssSanitizer.sanitize(css)
end
```  ```ruby
# Implement additional security measures
def sanitize_css(css)
  # Input validation
  if css =~ /\A\s*\z/
    return ''
  end

  # Sanitize the CSS code
  sanitized_css =
