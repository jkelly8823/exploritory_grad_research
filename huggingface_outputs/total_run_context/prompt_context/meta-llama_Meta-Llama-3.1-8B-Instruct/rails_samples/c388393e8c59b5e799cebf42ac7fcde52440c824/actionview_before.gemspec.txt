 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample includes a dependency on the rails-html-sanitizer gem version 1.0.2, which is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an HTML entity.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Update the rails-html-sanitizer gem to a version that is not vulnerable, such as 1.0.3 or later. This can be done by changing the dependency line to "rails-html-sanitizer", "~> 1.0", ">= 1.0.3". Additionally, consider using a more secure gem, such as sanitize or sanitize-rails, to sanitize user input.
