 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the lack of proper restriction on casts of string values. Specifically, the `with_params_parsers` method allows the use of a YAML parser, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Ruby on Rails version to 2.3.15, 3.0.19, 3.1.10, or 3.2.11 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Avoid using the `with_params_parsers` method with a YAML parser, or ensure that the YAML parser is properly sanitized and validated.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to YAML, such as JSON, for data serialization and deserialization. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it is using the latest security patches and best practices.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
