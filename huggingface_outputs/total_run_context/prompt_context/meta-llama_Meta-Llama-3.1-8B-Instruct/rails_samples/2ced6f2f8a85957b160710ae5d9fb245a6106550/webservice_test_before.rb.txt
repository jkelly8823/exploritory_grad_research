 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the use of YAML.load() which can execute arbitrary code. This is a known vulnerability in Ruby on Rails (CVE-2013-0156).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace YAML.load() with a safer alternative such as YAML.safe_load() to prevent arbitrary code execution.
- Consider using a more secure serialization format such as JSON. 
- Ensure that the input data is properly sanitized and validated before passing it to YAML.load(). 
- Update Ruby on Rails to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (2.3.15, 3.0.19, 3.1.10, 3.2.11 or later).  ```
