 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the use of Hash.from_xml, which does not properly restrict casts of string values. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by leveraging Action Pack support for YAML type conversion or Symbol type conversion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Ruby on Rails to version 2.3.15, 3.0.19, 3.1.10, or 3.2.11 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure alternative to Hash.from_xml, such as Nokogiri or a custom XML parser.
3. Validate and sanitize user-input XML data before parsing it with Hash.from_xml. 
4. Consider using a more secure data format, such as JSON, for data exchange. 
5. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure. 
6. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent potential attacks. 
7. Use a secure coding practice, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 
8. Consider using a secure XML parser,
