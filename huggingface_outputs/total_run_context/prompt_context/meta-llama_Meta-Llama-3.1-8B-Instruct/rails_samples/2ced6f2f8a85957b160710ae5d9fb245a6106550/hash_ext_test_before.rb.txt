 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to object-injection attacks due to the use of Hash.from_xml() which does not properly restrict casts of string values. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by leveraging Action Pack support for YAML type conversion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to parse XML, such as Nokogiri or REXML.
2. Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into the system.
3. Consider using a library like safe_yaml to safely parse YAML data. 
4. Update Ruby on Rails to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (2.3.15, 3.0.19, 3.1.10, 3.2.11). 
5. Implement a whitelist of allowed keys and values to further restrict the data that can be injected into the system. 6. Consider using a more secure data serialization format, such as JSON. 7. Use a library like attr_accessor to dynamically set attributes on an object, rather than using a hash to store data. 8. Use a library like strong_parameters to validate and sanitize
