VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of the `javascript` encoding in the `mail_to` helper. This encoding allows arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected into the page, which can be exploited by an attacker to steal user data or take control of the user's session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using the `javascript` encoding in the `mail_to` helper. Instead, use the `html_safe` method to mark the output as safe, or use a different encoding method that does not allow arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected. Additionally, you should consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) to help prevent XSS attacks. You can also use the `protect_against_forgery?` method to protect against CSRF attacks. 

Note: The `protect_against_forgery?` method is not directly related to the XSS vulnerability, but it is a good practice to implement it to protect against CSRF attacks. 

Also, the TODO comment in the `protect_against_forgery?` method suggests that it may be related to the XSS vulnerability,
