 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of the `html_safe` method on user-provided input (`email_address_obfuscated`) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted email address.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to sanitize user input, such as using a library like `sanitize` to remove any potentially malicious characters.
2. Avoid using `html_safe` on user-provided input, instead use a safer method like `h` to escape any special characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to encode email addresses, such as using a library like `uri` to encode the email address. 4. Always validate and sanitize user input before rendering it in a template. 5. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to help prevent XSS attacks. 6. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure. 7. Use a linter or code analyzer to catch potential security issues. 8. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect against XSS attacks.
