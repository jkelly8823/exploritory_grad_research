VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of the `javascript` encoding in the `mail_to` helper. This encoding allows for the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the `javascript` encoding in the `mail_to` helper.
2. Use a safer encoding, such as `html_escape`, to prevent XSS attacks.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against XSS attacks. 
4. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks. 
5. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed. 
6. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent XSS attacks. 
7. Regularly update and patch your application to ensure you have the latest security fixes. 
8. Use a secure coding practice, such as using prepared statements, to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
9. Use a secure protocol, such as HTTPS, to encrypt data in transit. 
10. Use a secure key management
