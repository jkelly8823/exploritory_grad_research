 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of the html_safe method on user input (email_address_obfuscated) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted email value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the sanitize method to remove any malicious code from the email_address_obfuscated variable before using html_safe.
2. Consider using a more secure method to encode the email address, such as using a library like rails-unicode-utilities. 
3. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE-2011-0446: This vulnerability is a known issue in Ruby on Rails and has been patched in versions 2.3.11 and 3.0.4. It is recommended to upgrade to a patched version of Ruby on Rails to prevent this vulnerability.  If upgrading is not possible, consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to help mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.  Additionally, ensure that all user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent this vulnerability.  Consider using a
