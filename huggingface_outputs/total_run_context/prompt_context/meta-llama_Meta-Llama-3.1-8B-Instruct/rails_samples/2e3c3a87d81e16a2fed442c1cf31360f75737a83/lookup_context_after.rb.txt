 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the potential for an invalid MIME type in the details[:formats] array. This can lead to excessive caching and memory consumption. The issue arises when the code attempts to cache the details object in the @details_keys cache, which is a ThreadSafe::Cache instance. If the details[:formats] array contains an invalid MIME type, it will not be filtered out by the syms.include? check, and the details object will be cached, leading to memory consumption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the MIME types in the details[:formats] array before caching the details object.
2. Consider using a more robust caching mechanism that can handle invalid MIME types.
3. Implement a mechanism to periodically clear the cache to prevent memory consumption.
