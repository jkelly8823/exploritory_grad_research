 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the use of a ThreadSafe::Cache object. This object is not properly synchronized, which can lead to a situation where the cache grows indefinitely, causing the application to consume increasing amounts of memory. This is a classic example of a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a thread-safe cache implementation that is designed to handle concurrent access, such as Redis or Memcached.
2. Implement a mechanism to periodically clear the cache to prevent it from growing indefinitely.
3. Consider using a more robust caching solution, such as a distributed cache, to handle large amounts of data.

  def self.clear
    @details_keys.clear
  end
end

class Details:
    @details_keys = ThreadSafe::Cache()
