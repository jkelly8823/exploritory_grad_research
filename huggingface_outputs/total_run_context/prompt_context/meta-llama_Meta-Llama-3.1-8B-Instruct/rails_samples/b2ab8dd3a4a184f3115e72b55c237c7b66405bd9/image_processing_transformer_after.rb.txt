VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be a custom implementation of an image processing transformer for Active Storage. It validates the transformation methods and arguments to ensure they are supported. The `validate_transformation` method checks if the transformation method is supported and raises an `UnsupportedImageProcessingMethod` error if it's not. Additionally, it checks if the argument is a string, symbol, array, or hash and validates it accordingly. The code also raises an `UnsupportedImageProcessingArgument` error if an unsupported argument is found. The `validate_arg_string`, `validate_arg_array`, and `validate_arg_hash` methods recursively validate the argument values. The code seems to be secure against the CVE-2022-21831 vulnerability, as it properly validates the transformation methods and arguments.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the CVE-2022-21831 vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to review and test the code
