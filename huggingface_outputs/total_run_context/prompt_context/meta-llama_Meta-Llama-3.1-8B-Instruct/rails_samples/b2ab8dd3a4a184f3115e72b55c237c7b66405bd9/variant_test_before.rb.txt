 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to code injection due to the use of the `send` method, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is a classic example of a code injection vulnerability, where an attacker can manipulate the `blob` object to execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `send` method with a safer alternative, such as `public_send` or `method_missing`.
2. Validate and sanitize any user-input data before passing it to the `send` method.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed methods or using a library that provides secure method invocation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-41180
CVE Description:
A vulnerability exists in the `ActiveRecord::Relation` class that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code via the `includes` method.

Code Sample:
    @articles = Article.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'test'")
    @articles = @articles.includes(:tags)
    @articles = @articles.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'test'")

This concludes your task.
