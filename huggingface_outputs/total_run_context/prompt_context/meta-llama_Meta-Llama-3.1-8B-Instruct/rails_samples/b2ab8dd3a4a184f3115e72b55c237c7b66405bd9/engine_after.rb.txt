 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-21831 because it does not properly sanitize the image_processing arguments. The default_unsupported_image_processing_arguments list is not exhaustive and does not include all possible arguments that could be used for code injection. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code by passing in a custom argument that is not in the list.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the default_unsupported_image_processing_arguments list to include all possible arguments that could be used for code injection.
2. Implement a whitelist approach to validate and sanitize the image_processing arguments before passing them to the image processing methods.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a library like `image_processing` that provides a safer way to process images. 
4. Regularly review and update the list of unsupported image processing arguments to ensure it remains comprehensive and up-to-date. 5. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to further mitigate the risk of code injection. 6. Ensure that the ActiveStorage configuration is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities. 7. Consider using a more secure storage solution, such as Amazon
