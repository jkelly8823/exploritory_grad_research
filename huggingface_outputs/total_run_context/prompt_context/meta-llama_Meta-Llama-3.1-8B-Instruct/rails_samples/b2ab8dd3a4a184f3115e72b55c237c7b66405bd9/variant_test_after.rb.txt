EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to code injection due to the use of unsanitized arguments in the image_processing method. The arguments are not properly validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize all arguments passed to the image_processing method.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific, safe arguments.
3. Consider using a library like Sanitize to sanitize user input.
4. Update the code to use a more secure method for processing variants, such as using a secure image processing library. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 6. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities. 7. Implement input validation and sanitization for all user input. 8. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. 9. Regularly update dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches. 10. Consider using a security-focused framework or
