 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to execute code via image_processing arguments. The code checks for the "combine_options" transformation and raises an error if it is present, which prevents the potential code injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure against the CVE-2022-21831 vulnerability. However, it's worth noting that the code does not handle the case where the "combine_options" transformation is not present, and it may be worth adding a check for this case to ensure that the code is robust.  The code could be improved by adding a check for the "combine_options" transformation in the process method, and raising an error if it is present. This would ensure that the code is secure against this vulnerability.  Additionally, it would be a good idea to add some logging or error handling to the process method to handle any unexpected errors that may occur.  This would help to ensure that the code is robust and can handle unexpected input.  The code could also be improved by adding some documentation to the process method to explain what it does and how it works.  This would make it easier for
