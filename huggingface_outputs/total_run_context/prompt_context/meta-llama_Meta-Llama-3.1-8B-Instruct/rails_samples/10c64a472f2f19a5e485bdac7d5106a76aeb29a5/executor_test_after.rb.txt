 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-23633 vulnerability because it does not properly close the response body in the `call_and_return_body` method. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, or 5.2.6.1 to fix the issue.
2. Alternatively, use the middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 to work around the problem. 
3. Ensure that the response body is properly closed in the `call_and_return_body` method by adding a `close` call after the `app.call` method. For example: `app.call("rack.input" => StringIO.new("")).close`. 
4. Consider using a more modern and secure approach to handling response bodies, such as using a library like `rack-body` to manage the response body lifecycle.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
