 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-23633 vulnerability because it does not properly close the response body. The `response.pop` call does not notify the `ActionDispatch::Executor` to reset thread local state for the next request, which can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, upgrade to Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, or 5.2.6.1. If upgrading is not possible, use the middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9 to work around the issue. Additionally, consider using a more secure approach to handling response bodies, such as using a `Rack::BodyProxy` with a block that properly closes the response body.
