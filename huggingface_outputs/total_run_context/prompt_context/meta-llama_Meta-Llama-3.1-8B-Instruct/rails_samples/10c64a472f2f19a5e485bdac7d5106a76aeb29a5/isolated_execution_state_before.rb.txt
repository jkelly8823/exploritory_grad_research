 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not appear to be related to the Action Pack framework or the specific vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23633. The code seems to be a simple implementation of a state management mechanism, likely used in a controller or service class. It does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is always a good practice to keep dependencies up-to-date and follow best practices for state management in Rails applications. Consider using a more robust state management solution, such as a dedicated gem or a custom implementation that takes into account thread safety and other potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-23633
CVE Description:
Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This has been fixed in Rails 7.
