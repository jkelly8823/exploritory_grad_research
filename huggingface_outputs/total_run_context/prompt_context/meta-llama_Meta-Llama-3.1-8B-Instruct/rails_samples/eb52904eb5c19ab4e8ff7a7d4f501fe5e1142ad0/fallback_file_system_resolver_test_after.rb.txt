 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The `find_all` method is called with a path that includes a `..` (dot dot) which can be used to traverse the directory structure and access arbitrary files. This is a classic example of a directory traversal vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the `find_all` method should be called with a path that is sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using the `File.dirname` method to remove any directory traversal characters from the path. For example:
```ruby
templates = @root_resolver.find_all("hello_world.erb", "#{File.dirname(FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH)}/test", false, locale: [], formats: [:html], variants: [], handlers: [:erb])
