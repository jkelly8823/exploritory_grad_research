 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. In the `relative_path` method, the `render` method is called with a file path that includes `../`, which allows an attacker to traverse up the directory tree and access arbitrary files. Similarly, in the `relative_path_with_dot` method, the file path includes a dot (`.`) followed by a directory name, which can also be used to traverse the directory tree. This vulnerability is due to the fact that the `render` method does not properly sanitize the file path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `render` method with a secure file path, such as `render file: "path/to/secure/file"`.
2. Use the `File.dirname` method to remove any directory traversal characters from the file path before passing it to the `render` method.
3. Consider using a more secure method, such as `render file: "path/to/secure/file", type: "text/plain"` to prevent directory traversal attacks.
