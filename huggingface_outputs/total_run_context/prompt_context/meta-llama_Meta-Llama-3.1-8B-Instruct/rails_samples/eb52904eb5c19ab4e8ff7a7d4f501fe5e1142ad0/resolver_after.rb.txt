 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the use of the `File.join` method in the `find_all_with_query` method. This method can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by providing a specially crafted query string that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `File.join` method with a safer method, such as `Path.join`, which is designed to prevent directory traversal attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize the `query` parameter in the `find_all_with_query` method to prevent malicious input.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as whitelisting allowed file paths or using a more secure caching mechanism.
