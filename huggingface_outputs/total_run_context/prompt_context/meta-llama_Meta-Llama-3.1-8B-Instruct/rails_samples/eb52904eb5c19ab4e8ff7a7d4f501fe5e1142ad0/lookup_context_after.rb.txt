 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the use of the `find` method in the `find_all` method. The `find` method is called with the `args_for_lookup` method, which does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious directory traversal characters (e.g., `..`). This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `find_all` method to use a sanitized version of the input, such as `File.dirname(name)` to prevent directory traversal attacks.
2. Consider using a more secure method for finding templates, such as using a whitelist of allowed directories.
3. Remove the deprecated `find_file` method to prevent confusion and potential security issues.
