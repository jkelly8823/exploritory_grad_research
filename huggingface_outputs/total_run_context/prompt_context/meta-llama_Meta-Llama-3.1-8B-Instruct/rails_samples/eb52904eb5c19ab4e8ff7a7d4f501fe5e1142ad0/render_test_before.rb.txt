EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. This is because the `get` method in the `test_dynamic_render_with_file` and `test_permitted_dynamic_render_file_hash` methods is called with a parameter that contains a path with a `..` (dot dot) in it. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed paths or by using a library that provides path validation.
2. Use a more secure method to render files, such as using a library that provides secure file rendering.
3. Remove the `assert_deprecated` block, as it is not necessary and may be causing the vulnerability. 
4. Use a more secure way to read the file, such as using a library that provides secure file reading. 
5. Consider using a more secure framework or library that provides built-in protection against directory traversal attacks.  ```ruby
