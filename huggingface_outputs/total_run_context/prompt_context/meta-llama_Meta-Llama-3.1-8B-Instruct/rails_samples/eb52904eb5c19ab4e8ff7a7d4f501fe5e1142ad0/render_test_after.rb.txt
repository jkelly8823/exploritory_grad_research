 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of `File.expand_path` with a user-provided path. In the `test_dynamic_render_with_file` method, the `params[:id]` is used to construct a file path, which can be manipulated by an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. Similarly, in the `test_permitted_dynamic_render_file_hash` method, the `params[:id][:file]` is used to construct a file path, which can also be manipulated by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure that only allowed file paths are accepted.
2. Use a more secure method to construct file paths, such as using `Pathname` or `URI`.
3. Consider using a library like `rails-security` to help protect against common security vulnerabilities.  ```ruby
# Using a whitelist approach to validate user input
def test_dynamic_render_with_file
  allowed_paths = %w[test/abstract_unit.rb]
  assert File.exist?(File.expand_path(allowed_paths.first, __dir__))
  assert_deprecated do
