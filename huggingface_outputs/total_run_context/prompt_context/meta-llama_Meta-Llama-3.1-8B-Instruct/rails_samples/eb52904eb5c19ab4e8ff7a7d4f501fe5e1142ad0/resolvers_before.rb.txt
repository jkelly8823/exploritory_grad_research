 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of Regexp.escape on the file extensions. This allows an attacker to inject malicious file extensions and potentially read arbitrary files on the system. The NullResolver class does not properly sanitize the path, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path and access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the file extensions and only allow specific extensions.
2. Use a library like Rack::Attack to prevent brute-force attacks and limit the number of requests.
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the path parameter.
4. Consider using a more secure method to generate the template, such as using a template engine like ERb.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
