 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to the use of the `find_all_anywhere` method in the `_find_all` method. This method is called when `outside_app` is true, and it allows the attacker to specify a path that can traverse outside the intended directory. The `path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious directory traversal characters (e.g., `..`).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `find_all_anywhere` method with a sanitized version that removes directory traversal characters from the `path` parameter.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the `path` parameter to prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method for resolving templates, such as using a whitelist of allowed directories or using a secure template resolution library.
