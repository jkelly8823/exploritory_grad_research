 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the use of the `find_file` and `find_all` methods, which do not properly sanitize the input `name` parameter. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted `name` value that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), allowing them to access arbitrary files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `find_file` and `find_all` methods to properly sanitize the `name` parameter by using a whitelist of allowed characters or a regular expression to validate the input.
2. Consider using a more secure method for resolving view paths, such as using a path-based approach rather than relying on the `find_file` and `find_all` methods.
3. Ensure that the `@view_paths` object is properly configured to prevent directory traversal attacks. This may involve setting the `raise` option to `true` to raise an exception when an invalid path is encountered. VULNERABILITY LIST:
