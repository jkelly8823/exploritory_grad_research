EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of ERB::Util.html_escape in the escape_unsafe_options method. This method is intended to prevent XSS attacks by escaping any HTML special characters in the options hash. However, it does not account for the possibility of an attacker injecting malicious HTML code through the units parameter. The escape_units method, which is called by escape_unsafe_options, uses ERB::Util.html_escape to escape any HTML special characters in the units hash. However, this method does not account for the possibility of an attacker injecting malicious HTML code through the units hash. This is because the units hash is not checked for HTML special characters before being passed to ERB::Util.html_escape. As a result, an attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML code through the units parameter, which would be executed by the browser when the code is rendered.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to escape HTML special characters, such as the sanitize method provided by the rails-html-sanitizer gem.
2. Check the units hash for HTML special characters before passing it to ERB::
