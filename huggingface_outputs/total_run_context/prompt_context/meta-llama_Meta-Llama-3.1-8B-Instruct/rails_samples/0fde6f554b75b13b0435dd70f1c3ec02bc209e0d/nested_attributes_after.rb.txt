VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-7577 because it does not properly implement the destroy option for nested attributes. The `will_be_destroyed?` method checks if the `:allow_destroy` option is true and if the `:destroy_flag` is present in the attributes. However, it does not properly handle the case where the `:reject_if` proc is defined and evaluates to true. This allows an attacker to bypass intended change restrictions by leveraging the nested attributes feature.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `will_be_destroyed?` method to properly handle the case where the `:reject_if` proc is defined and evaluates to true.
2. Add a check to ensure that the `:reject_if` proc is not defined or evaluates to false before calling it.
3. Consider adding additional logging or auditing to track changes to nested attributes. This can help detect and prevent unauthorized changes. 4. Review and update the `nested_attributes_options` hash to ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized. 5. Consider using a more secure approach to handling nested attributes, such as using a separate model or service to
