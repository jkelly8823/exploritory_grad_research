 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-7577 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the accepts_nested_attributes_for method to enable nested attributes for the interests association, but it does not properly implement the destroy option. This allows an attacker to bypass intended change restrictions by leveraging use of the nested attributes feature.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should implement the destroy option for the interests association. This can be done by adding the following code to the model: accepts_nested_attributes_for :interests, allow_destroy: true. This will enable the destroy option for the interests association, preventing the vulnerability. Additionally, you should ensure that the destroy option is properly implemented in the controller and views to prevent unintended behavior.
