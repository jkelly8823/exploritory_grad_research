 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-7577 because it uses the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method with `allow_destroy: false` but still allows the destruction of associated records. This is a known vulnerability in Active Record that allows remote attackers to bypass intended change restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set `allow_destroy: true` to allow the destruction of associated records.
- Use `reject_if` to reject the destruction of associated records if the condition is not met.
- Update to a version of Active Record that is not vulnerable to this issue.
