 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-7577 because it does not properly implement the destroy option for nested attributes. The reject_new_record? method checks if a record should be rejected based on the presence of a destroy flag or a reject_if proc. However, the call_reject_if method does not properly handle the case where a reject_if proc is defined and evaluates to true. This allows an attacker to bypass intended change restrictions by leveraging the nested attributes feature.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the call_reject_if method to properly handle the case where a reject_if proc is defined and evaluates to true.
2. Add a check to ensure that the reject_if proc is not defined or evaluates to false before calling it.
3. Consider adding additional logging or auditing to track changes made to nested attributes. This can help detect and prevent unauthorized changes.  ```python
def call_reject_if(association_name, attributes)
  return false if has_destroy_flag?(attributes)
  if self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if].is_a?(Proc)
    if self.nested_attributes_options[association_name][:reject_if].call(attributes
