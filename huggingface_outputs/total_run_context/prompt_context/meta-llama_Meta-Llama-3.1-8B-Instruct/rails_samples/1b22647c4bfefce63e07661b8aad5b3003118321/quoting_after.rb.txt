 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for a slow sequential scan when comparing integer values against numeric values. This is because the PostgreSQL connection adapter does not properly handle values outside the range of a 64-bit signed integer. The `check_int_in_range` method raises an exception when a value outside this range is provided, but this exception is not properly handled in all cases, potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the PostgreSQL connection adapter to a version that properly handles values outside the range of a 64-bit signed integer.
2. Set `ActiveRecord.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` to `false` to allow for the potentially unwanted behavior, but this is not recommended as it may introduce security vulnerabilities.
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent denial of service attacks when comparing integer values against numeric values. This may involve adding additional checks or using a more robust comparison method.
