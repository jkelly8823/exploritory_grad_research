 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly interacts with the PostgreSQL adapter or uses the `use_yaml_unsafe_load` method. The test is focused on verifying the default value of `yaml_column_permitted_classes` in the `ActiveRecord` configuration. Therefore, it does not pose a risk of introducing a denial of service vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be a test case and does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the `use_yaml_unsafe_load` method is not used in production code, as it can pose a security risk if not used carefully. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-44566
CVE Description:
A denial of service vulnerability present in ActiveRecord's PostgreSQL adapter <7.0.4.1 and <6.1.7.1. When a value outside the range for a 64bit signed integer is provided to the PostgreSQL connection adapter, it will treat the target column type as numeric. Comparing integer values against numeric values can result in a slow sequential scan resulting in potential Denial of Service.
