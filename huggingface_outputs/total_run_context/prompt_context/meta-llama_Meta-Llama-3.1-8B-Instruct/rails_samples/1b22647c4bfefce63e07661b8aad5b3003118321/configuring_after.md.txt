 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the PostgreSQL adapter or the `ActiveRecord::Coders::YAMLColumn`. However, the presence of the `config.active_record.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` setting suggests that the code is using an older version of ActiveRecord that is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-44566. This setting is deprecated and defaults to `false` in newer versions of ActiveRecord. If this setting is set to `true`, it may indicate that the code is vulnerable to the denial of service vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update ActiveRecord to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2022-44566 (ActiveRecord 7.0.4.1 or later, or ActiveRecord 6.1.7.1 or later).
2. Set `config.active_record.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` to `false` to prevent the vulnerability.
3. Consider using a more secure configuration for the PostgreSQL adapter, such as setting `config.active_record.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` to `true` only when necessary.
