 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a test case for the PostgreSQL adapter in ActiveRecord. The vulnerability in question is related to the handling of 64-bit signed integers. The code checks for this vulnerability by attempting to quote values that are outside the range of a 64-bit signed integer. If the value is outside this range, it should raise an exception. However, the code also includes a test case where this behavior is disabled by setting `ActiveRecord.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` to `false`. This suggests that the code is designed to handle this vulnerability, but it may not be enabled by default.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `ActiveRecord.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` is set to `true` by default. This will prevent the PostgreSQL adapter from treating 64-bit signed integers as numeric values, which can lead to a denial of service. You can do this by adding a line to your application's configuration file, such as `config/environments/*.rb`, to set `ActiveRecord.raise_int_wider_than_64bit` to `true`. Additionally, you should consider adding a check to ensure that this
