 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the CVE-2022-44566 vulnerability. However, the code does contain configuration options for the MySQL adapter, which could potentially be used to configure the adapter to behave in a way that could lead to the vulnerability if the adapter is not properly configured. The vulnerability is related to the PostgreSQL adapter, not the MySQL adapter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the configuration options for the MySQL adapter to ensure they are not being used to configure the adapter to behave in a way that could lead to the vulnerability.
- Consider using a more secure configuration for the MySQL adapter, such as setting `emulate_booleans` to `false`.
- Ensure that the PostgreSQL adapter is properly configured and up-to-date to prevent the vulnerability.
