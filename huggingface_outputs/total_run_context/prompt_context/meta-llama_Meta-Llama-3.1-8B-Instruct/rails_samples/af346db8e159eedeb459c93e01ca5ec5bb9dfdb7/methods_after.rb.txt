 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression in line 3 is vulnerable to a DoS attack. The regular expression engine can enter a state of catastrophic backtracking if a specially crafted string is passed to the underscore method. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the version of Active Support to 6.1.7.1 or later, or 7.0.4.1 or later.
2. Use a more secure regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the `oniguruma` gem.
3. Implement a timeout or rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse. 
4. Use a more secure method to handle the underscore method, such as using a loop instead of a regular expression. 
5. Consider using a more secure library, such as the `inflecto` gem, which provides a more secure implementation of the underscore method.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
