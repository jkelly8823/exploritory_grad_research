VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the open redirect vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22881. The `remote_ip` method is not properly validating the `Host` header, which can be used to redirect users to a malicious website. This is because the `Host` header is not being checked against the allowed hosts, which can contain a leading dot. This allows an attacker to craft a specially crafted `Host` header that can redirect users to a malicious website.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `Host` header against the allowed hosts to prevent open redirects.
2. Ensure that the allowed hosts do not contain leading dots.
3. Consider using a more secure method to generate the `action_dispatch.key_generator` key, such as using a secure random number generator. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve the `action_dispatch.key_generator` key, such as using a secure key store. 
5. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as IP blocking or rate limiting, to prevent brute-force attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
