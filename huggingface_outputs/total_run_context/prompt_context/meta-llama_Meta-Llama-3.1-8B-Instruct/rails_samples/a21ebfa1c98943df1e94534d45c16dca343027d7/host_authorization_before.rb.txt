 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack. The `valid_host` regular expression allows for a leading dot in the host, which can be exploited to redirect users to a malicious website. This is a known vulnerability in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Action Pack to a version that is not vulnerable (6.1.2.1 or 6.0.3.5 or later).
2. Modify the `valid_host` regular expression to not allow a leading dot in the host.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent open redirects, such as validating the `Host` header against a trusted list of allowed hosts.  VULNERABLE: YES
