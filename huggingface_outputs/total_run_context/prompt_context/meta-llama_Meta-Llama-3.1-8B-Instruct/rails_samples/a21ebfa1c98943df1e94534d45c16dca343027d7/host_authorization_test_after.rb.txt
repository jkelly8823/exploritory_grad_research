 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the use of a specially crafted `Host` header in combination with certain "allowed host" formats. This can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. The vulnerability is present in the line where the `get` request is made with an environment variable `HOST` set to a specially crafted value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method to validate the `Host` header, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts.
- Avoid using the `HOST` header to determine the allowed hosts, instead use a secure method to determine the allowed hosts.
- Update the `ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization` middleware to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
