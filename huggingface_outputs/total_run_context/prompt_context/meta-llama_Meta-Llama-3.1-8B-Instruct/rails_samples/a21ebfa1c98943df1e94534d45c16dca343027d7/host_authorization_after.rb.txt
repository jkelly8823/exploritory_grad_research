 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the use of the `slice` method on the `VALID_ORIGIN_HOST` and `VALID_FORWARDED_HOST` regular expressions. This allows an attacker to inject malicious URLs by manipulating the `HTTP_HOST` header. The `slice` method is used to extract the first match from the regular expression, which can lead to an open redirect vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to extract the host from the `HTTP_HOST` header, such as using the `URI` class to parse the URL.
2. Remove the `slice` method and use the entire match from the regular expression instead.
3. Consider using a more robust library for parsing URLs, such as `rack-rewrite`.
