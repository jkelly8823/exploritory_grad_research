 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack. The `get` method is using a specially crafted `Host` header with the value "example.com" which can be used to redirect users to a malicious website. This is because the allowed host contains a leading dot, which can be exploited by a specially crafted `Host` header.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Action Pack to version 6.1.2.1 or 6.0.3.5 to fix the vulnerability.
- Use a secure `Host` header validation mechanism to prevent open redirects.
- Avoid using the `Rack::MockRequest.env_for` method to set the `HTTP_HOST` header, instead use a secure method to set the host header. 
- Validate the `HTTP_HOST` header to prevent open redirects. 
- Use a whitelist approach to allow only trusted hosts. 
- Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent open redirects.  ```ruby
    def get(path)
      @app.call(::Rack::MockRequest.env_for(path, "HTTP_HOST" => "example.com"))
