 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the open redirect vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22881. The `remote_ip` method is not properly validating the `HTTP_HOST` header, which can be used to redirect users to a malicious website. This is because the `action_dispatch.show_exceptions` and `action_dispatch.key_generator` are not relevant to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `HTTP_HOST` header to ensure it matches the expected format.
2. Use a secure method to generate the `action_dispatch.key_generator` to prevent potential key generation vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle redirects, such as using a whitelist of allowed hosts. 
4. Update the `action_dispatch.show_exceptions` to a secure default value. 
5. Consider using a more secure method to handle the `HTTP_HOST` header, such as using a secure parsing library.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
