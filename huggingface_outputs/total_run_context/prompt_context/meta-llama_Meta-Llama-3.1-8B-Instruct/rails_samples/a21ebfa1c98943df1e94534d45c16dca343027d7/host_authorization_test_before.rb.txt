 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability due to the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack. The middleware can be tricked into redirecting users to a malicious website by using specially crafted `Host` headers in combination with certain "allowed host" formats. This is a known vulnerability in Action Pack before 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Action Pack to version 6.1.2.1 or 6.0.3.5 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Use a secure alternative to the Host Authorization middleware, such as Rack::Attack.
- Validate user input to prevent specially crafted `Host` headers from being used to redirect users to malicious websites.
