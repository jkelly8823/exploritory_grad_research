 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0276 because it uses a regular expression to match the prefix and suffix, but it does not properly escape the prefix and suffix. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by manipulating the prefix and suffix.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `Regexp.escape` method to properly escape the prefix and suffix.
2. Use a more secure method to match the prefix and suffix, such as using a string comparison.
3. Consider using a library like `rails-secure` to help protect against this vulnerability.  ```ruby
@regex = /\A(?:#{Regexp.escape(@prefix)})(.*)(?:#{Regexp.escape(@suffix)})\z/
``` should be replaced with ```ruby
@regex = Regexp.new("^#{Regexp.escape(@prefix)}(.*)#{Regexp.escape(@suffix)}$")
``` 
Note: The above code is just a suggestion and may need to be adjusted based on the actual requirements of the code.  ```ruby
@method_name = "#{prefix}%s#{suffix}"
``` should be replaced with ```ruby
@method_name = "#{prefix}_#{suffix
