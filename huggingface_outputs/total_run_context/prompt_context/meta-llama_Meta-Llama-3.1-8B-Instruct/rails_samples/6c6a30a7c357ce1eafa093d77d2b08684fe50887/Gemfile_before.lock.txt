 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability CVE-2018-7212 is present in the code because the rack-protection gem is used with Sinatra 2.x before 2.0.1 on Windows. This allows for path traversal via backslash characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the rack-protection gem to version 2.0.1 or later.
- Ensure that the Sinatra version is 2.0.1 or later.
- Consider using a more secure gem for path traversal protection. 
- Always validate user input to prevent path traversal attacks.  ```
