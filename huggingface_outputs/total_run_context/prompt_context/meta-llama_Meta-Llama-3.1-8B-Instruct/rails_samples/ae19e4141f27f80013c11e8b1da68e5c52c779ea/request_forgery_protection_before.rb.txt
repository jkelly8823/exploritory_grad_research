 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks due to the lack of proper validation of HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. Although the code attempts to protect against CSRF attacks by using the authenticity token, it does not properly validate the token in all cases, specifically when the request is not an HTML request or when the format is restricted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the authenticity token is properly validated for all types of requests, not just HTML requests.
2. Consider using a more robust CSRF protection mechanism, such as the `protect_from_forgery` method with the `:except` option to specify which actions should not be protected.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure against CSRF attacks.
