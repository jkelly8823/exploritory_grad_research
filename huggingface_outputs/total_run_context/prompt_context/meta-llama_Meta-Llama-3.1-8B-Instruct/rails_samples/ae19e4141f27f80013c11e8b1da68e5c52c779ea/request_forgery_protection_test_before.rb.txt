 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks because it does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. The `protect_from_forgery` method is used to protect against CSRF attacks, but it is only enabled for the `index` and `meta` actions. This means that any other actions in the application are not protected against CSRF attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should enable CSRF protection for all actions in the application by removing the `:only` option from the `protect_from_forgery` method. This will ensure that all HTTP requests are properly validated and protected against CSRF attacks. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure method to generate the CSRF token, such as using a secure random number generator.
