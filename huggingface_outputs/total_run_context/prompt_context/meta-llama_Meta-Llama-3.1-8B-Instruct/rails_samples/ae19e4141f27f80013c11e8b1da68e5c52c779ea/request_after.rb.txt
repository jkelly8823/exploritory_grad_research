 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks due to the lack of proper validation of HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. The forgery_whitelisted? method is an alias for the get? method, which means it does not properly validate the request. This makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks via forged AJAX or API requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the code to properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header.
- Use a secure method to validate the request, such as checking the request's origin or using a token-based validation system.
- Consider upgrading to a newer version of Ruby on Rails that includes the necessary security patches.  ```ruby
    end

    def forgery_whitelisted?
      request.env['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == 'XMLHttpRequest'
    end
    deprecate :forgery_whitelisted? => "it is just an alias for'request.env['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == 'XMLHttpRequest'' now, update your code"
