 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks due to the lack of proper validation of HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. This is a known vulnerability in Ruby on Rails 2.1.x, 2.2.x, and 2.3.x before 2.3.11, and 3.x before 3.0.4.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Ruby on Rails to a version that is not vulnerable (e.g., 2.3.11 or later, or 3.0.4 or later).
2. Use the `protect_from_forgery` method with the `:except` option to exclude certain actions from CSRF protection.
3. Use the `protect_from_forgery` method with the `:only` option to include only certain actions in CSRF protection.
4. Use a custom token name by setting `ActionController::Base.request_forgery_protection_token` to a custom value.
5. Use a token-based authentication system, such as Devise, to handle user authentication and CSRF protection. 
6. Use a library like `rails-security`
