 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks due to the improper validation of HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. The `verified_request?` method checks if the form authenticity token matches the given token value from the params or the X-CSRF-Token header. However, it does not properly validate the X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `verified_request?` method to properly validate the X-Requested-With header by checking if it matches the expected value.
2. Consider using a more secure method to validate the authenticity token, such as using a token that is generated on the server-side and stored in the session.
3. Ensure that the `protect_against_forgery?` method is properly configured to prevent CSRF attacks.
