 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CSRF vulnerability described in CVE-2020-8167. The issue arises from the fact that the CSRF token is being set on the xhr object without proper validation. This allows an attacker to send the CSRF token to a different domain, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the CSRF token before setting it on the xhr object.
2. Use a secure method to generate and store the CSRF token, such as using a token-based authentication system.
3. Ensure that the CSRF token is only sent to the intended domain by validating the request's origin.
