 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CSRF vulnerability described in CVE-2020-8167. The CSRFProtection function is called when the request is not cross-domain, but the function is not shown in the provided code. However, based on the description of the vulnerability, it is likely that the CSRFProtection function is not properly implemented, allowing attackers to send CSRF tokens to the wrong domain.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the CSRFProtection function is properly implemented to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Verify that the CSRF token is being sent to the correct domain.
- Consider using a library or framework that provides CSRF protection, such as Rails' built-in CSRF protection.  ```javascript
// Ensure the CSRF token is being sent to the correct domain
function CSRFProtection(xhr) {
  xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', 'your_token_here');
  xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Header', 'your_header_here');
}
```  ```javascript
// Verify that the CSRF token is being sent to the correct domain
xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', 'your_token_here');
xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Header', 'your_header_here');
```  ```javascript
