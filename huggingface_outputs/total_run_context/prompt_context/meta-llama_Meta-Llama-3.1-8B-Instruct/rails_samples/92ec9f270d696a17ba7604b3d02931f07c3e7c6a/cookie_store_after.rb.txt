 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session hijacking due to the use of timing attacks on the session id. The session id is stored and indexed in a database, and an attacker can measure the time it takes to look up a session to find a valid session id. This is a known vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack) that is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a patched version of Rack (RubyGem rack) (1.6.12 or 2.0.8).
2. Implement a secure comparison for the session id in the backing store.
3. Use a secure random number generator to generate the session id. 
4. Consider using a secure session management library that is not vulnerable to timing attacks. 
5. Regularly review and update the session management code to ensure it is secure.  ```
