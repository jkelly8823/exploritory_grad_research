VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the way session IDs are handled. In the `get_session_id` method, the session ID is rendered as plain text, which can be accessed by an attacker. Additionally, the `call_reset_session` method does not properly reset the session, allowing an attacker to hijack the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).
2. Implement a secure comparison for session IDs, such as using a constant-time comparison function.
3. Properly reset the session in the `call_reset_session` method by deleting the session ID and any associated data. 
4. Use HTTPS to encrypt the session ID and prevent it from being accessed by an attacker. 
5. Consider using a more secure session management library, such as Rack::Session::Cookie. 
6. Regularly update and patch dependencies, including Rack, to ensure you have the latest security fixes. 
7. Implement a secure cookie flag, such as `Secure` and `HttpOnly`, to prevent JavaScript access to the session ID
