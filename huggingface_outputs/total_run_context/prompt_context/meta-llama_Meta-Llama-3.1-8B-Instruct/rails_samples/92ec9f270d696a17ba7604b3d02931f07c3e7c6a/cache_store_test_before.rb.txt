 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the way it handles session IDs. In the `get_session_id` method, the session ID is rendered as plain text, which can be accessed by an attacker. Additionally, the `call_reset_session` method does not properly reset the session, allowing an attacker to fixate the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a secure random number generator and storing the ID in a secure cookie.
2. Implement a secure session reset mechanism, such as using a secure token to reset the session.
3. Use a secure comparison method when checking for session IDs, such as using a constant-time comparison function. VULNERABLE: YES
