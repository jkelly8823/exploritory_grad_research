 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-16782 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the way session ids are indexed and compared in the Rack framework, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample is a Gemfile snippet that lists dependencies, but it does not include any code that would be susceptible to this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this issue. However, if you are using Rack or Rails, ensure that you are running a patched version of the framework to prevent this vulnerability.  ```bash
gem 'rack', '~> 2.0.8'
gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.3.2'
``` ```bash
gem 'rack', '~> 2.0.8'
gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.3.2'
``` ```bash
gem 'rack', '~> 2.0.8'
