VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the way it handles session lookups. In the <tt>find_session</tt> method, the code checks if a session exists in the cache by calling <tt>@cache.read(cache_key(sid))</tt>. If the session does not exist, it generates a new session id and returns it. However, the time it takes to read from the cache can vary depending on whether the session exists or not. An attacker can measure this time difference to determine whether a session exists or not, allowing them to hijack sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure comparison method to check if a session exists in the cache. This can be done by using a constant-time comparison function, such as <tt>SecureRandom</tt> to generate a random value and compare it with the session id.
2. Consider using a cache store that is designed to be secure against timing attacks, such as Redis or Memcached.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as rate limiting or IP blocking, to prevent brute-force attacks.  ```ruby
