 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session hijacking due to the way session IDs are handled. The `get_session_id` method directly exposes the session ID in the response, which can be used by an attacker to hijack the session. Additionally, the `reset_session` method does not properly clear the session ID, leaving it vulnerable to timing attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
2. Implement a secure comparison for session IDs in the backing store to prevent timing attacks.
3. Clear the session ID properly after resetting the session using `session.clear` instead of `reset_session`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-16782
CVE Description: 
There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of
