 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-16782 vulnerability because it is using Rack version 2.0.8, which is the patched version. However, the vulnerability is still present because the session id is not being compared securely. The session id is being stored and indexed in a database, and the comparison is not using a secure scheme. This allows an attacker to use timing attacks to find a valid session id and hijack the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Rack to a version greater than 2.0.8 to fix the vulnerability.
- Use a secure comparison scheme when indexing and comparing session ids in the database. 
- Consider using a secure random number generator to generate session ids. 
- Implement additional security measures to prevent timing attacks, such as using a constant-time comparison function.  ```python
def is_vulnerable(code):
    # Check if Rack version is greater than 2.0.8
    if "rack" in code and ">= 2.0.8" in code:
        return True
    # Check if session id is being stored and indexed in a database
