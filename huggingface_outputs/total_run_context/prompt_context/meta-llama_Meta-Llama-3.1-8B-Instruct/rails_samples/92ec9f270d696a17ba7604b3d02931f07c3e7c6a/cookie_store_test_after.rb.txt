VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session hijacking due to the way session IDs are handled. The `get_session_id` method directly exposes the session ID in the response, which can be used by an attacker to hijack the session. The `reset_session` method does not properly clear the session ID, allowing an attacker to potentially reuse the session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
2. Implement a secure comparison for session IDs in the backing store to prevent timing attacks.
3. Clear the session ID properly after resetting the session using `reset_session`. This can be done by setting `request.session.id = nil` after calling `reset_session`. 
4. Consider using a more secure session management system, such as one that uses a secure token or a token-based system.  ```ruby
    def get_session_id
      render plain: "id: #{request.session.id&.public_id}"
    end

    def get_class_after_reset_session
      reset_session
      request.session.id = nil
    end
```  ```ruby
