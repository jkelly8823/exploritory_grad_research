EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session hijacking due to the use of timing attacks targeting the session id. The session id is stored and indexed in a database, and the comparison of the session id is not secure. This allows an attacker to find a valid session id by measuring the time it takes to look up a session. The code uses the `stale_session_check!` method to check for stale sessions, but this does not prevent session hijacking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure comparison method for the session id, such as using a constant-time comparison function.
2. Use a secure random number generator to generate the session id.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as using a secure cookie jar or a secure session store.
4. Update the code to use a secure version of Rack (RubyGem rack) that is patched for this vulnerability.
