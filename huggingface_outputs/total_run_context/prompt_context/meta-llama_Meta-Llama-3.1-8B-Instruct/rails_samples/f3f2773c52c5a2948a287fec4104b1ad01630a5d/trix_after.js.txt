 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when copying and pasting content from the web or other documents with markup into the editor. The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of pasted content, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts which are executed within the context of the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.1 or later, which incorporates proper sanitization of input from copied content.
2. Implement a robust HTML sanitizer to prevent malicious scripts from being executed.
3. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of scripts that can be executed within the application. 
4. Validate and sanitize user input before rendering it in the editor. 
5. Consider using a library like DOMPurify to sanitize user input and prevent XSS attacks. 
6. Regularly update dependencies and libraries to ensure you have the latest security patches. 
7. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks, including XSS. 
8. Use a secure protocol (HTTPS) to encrypt data in transit. 
9. Implement a secure password policy and use a password
