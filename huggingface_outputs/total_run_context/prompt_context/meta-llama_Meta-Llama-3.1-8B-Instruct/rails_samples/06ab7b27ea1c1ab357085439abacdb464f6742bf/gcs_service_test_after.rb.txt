 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the code is using the `content_type` and `content_disposition` parameters in the `upload` and `update_metadata` methods, which can be used to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters of the uploaded file. This can be exploited to execute inline HTML files and gain access to private signed URLs within a specific storage path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to Active Storage version 5.2.1.1 or later.
- Avoid using the `content_type` and `content_disposition` parameters in the `upload` and `update_metadata` methods.
- Use the `signed_url` method to generate signed URLs for uploaded files.
- Validate user input and ensure that only authorized users can modify the metadata of uploaded files.  ```ruby
