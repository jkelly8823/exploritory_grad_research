 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. The code is using the `expected_url_for` method to generate URLs for blobs, which takes into account the content type and disposition parameters. The method is also using the `ActiveStorage.verifier.generate` method to generate a blob key, which is a security feature to prevent tampering with the URL. Additionally, the code is using the `freeze_time` method to test the behavior of the `service_url` method, which suggests that the code is designed to handle time-sensitive operations in a controlled environment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix the vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to regularly review the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
