 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage. The `serve_file` method is being called with user-controlled parameters (`content_type` and `disposition`) which can be used to execute inline HTML files. This is a result of the `decode_verified_key` method returning a hash with user-controlled values for these parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Active Storage to version 5.2.1.1 or later.
- Validate and sanitize the `content_type` and `disposition` parameters before passing them to the `serve_file` method.
- Consider using a more secure method to serve files, such as using a whitelist of allowed file types and extensions.  ```ruby
def show
  if key = decode_verified_key
    serve_file disk_service.path_for(key[:key]), content_type: 'application/octet-stream', disposition: 'attachment'
  else
    head :not_found
  end
rescue Errno::ENOENT
```  ```ruby
def show
  if key = decode_verified_key
    serve_file disk_service.path_for(key[:key]), content_type: 'application/octet-stream', disposition: '
