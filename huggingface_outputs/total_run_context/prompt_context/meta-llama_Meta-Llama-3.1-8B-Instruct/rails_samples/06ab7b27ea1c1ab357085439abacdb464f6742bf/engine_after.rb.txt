 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the `content_types_allowed_inline` configuration is set to allow `text/cache-manifest` which can be used in conjunction with other techniques to gain access to private signed URLs within a specific storage path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Active Storage to version 5.2.1.1 or later.
2. Remove `text/cache-manifest` from the `content_types_allowed_inline` configuration.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent cookie bombing and specially crafted AppCache manifests. 4. Review and update the `variable_content_types`, `content_types_to_serve_as_binary`, `service_urls_expire_in`, and `binary_content_type` configurations to ensure they are secure. 5. Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent inline execution of scripts. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 7. Consider using a security-focused framework or library to help identify and prevent vulnerabilities. 8. Implement a secure coding practice to ensure that all
