 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the `url` method allows an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters which can be used in with HTML files and have them executed inline. The `url` method does not properly sanitize the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Active Storage to version 5.2.1.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Sanitize the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters in the `url` method to prevent malicious code injection.
3. Use a whitelist approach to validate the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters to ensure only allowed values are accepted.
