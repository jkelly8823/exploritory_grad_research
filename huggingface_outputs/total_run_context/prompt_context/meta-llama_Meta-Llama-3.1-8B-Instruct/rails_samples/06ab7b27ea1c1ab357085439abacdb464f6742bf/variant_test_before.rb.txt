 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the Active Storage vulnerability. The code is testing the behavior of the service_url for a variant of a file blob, and does not involve modifying the content-disposition or content-type parameters. Additionally, the code does not involve any techniques such as cookie bombing or specially crafted AppCache manifests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code sample. It appears to be a test case for the Active Storage library and does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is always a good practice to keep the library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Consider updating the Active Storage library to the latest version.  ```ruby

EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains a potential vulnerability related to the use of the `eval` function. The `eval` function can be used to execute arbitrary Ruby code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if not used carefully. In this case, the `eval` function is used to execute a string that contains a Ruby expression. However, the string is not properly sanitized,
