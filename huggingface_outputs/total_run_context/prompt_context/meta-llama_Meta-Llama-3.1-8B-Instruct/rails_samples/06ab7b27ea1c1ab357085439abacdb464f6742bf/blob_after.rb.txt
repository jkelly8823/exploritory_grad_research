 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the `service_url` method allows an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters which can be used in with HTML files and have them executed inline. This is a known vulnerability that has been fixed in version 5.2.1.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Active Storage to version 5.2.1.1 or later to fix this vulnerability.
- Review the code to ensure that it is not using any other vulnerable versions of Active Storage.
- Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```ruby
