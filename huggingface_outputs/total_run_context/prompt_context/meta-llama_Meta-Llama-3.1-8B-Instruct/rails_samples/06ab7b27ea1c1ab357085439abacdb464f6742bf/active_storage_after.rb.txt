 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the Active Storage bypass vulnerability. The code appears to be setting up class attributes and defining a module named Transformers. There is no indication of any code that would allow an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters or access private signed URLs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to ensure that the Active Storage version is up-to-date, specifically version 5.2.1.1 or later, to prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to the use of `mattr_accessor` and ensure that it is being used correctly.  ```
