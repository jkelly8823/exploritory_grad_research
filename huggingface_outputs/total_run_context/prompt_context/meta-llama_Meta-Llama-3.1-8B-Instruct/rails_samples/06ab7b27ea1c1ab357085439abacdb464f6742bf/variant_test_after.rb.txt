 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the Active Storage vulnerability. The code is testing the behavior of the service_url for a variant of a file blob, and does not involve modifying the content-disposition or content-type parameters. Additionally, the code does not involve any techniques such as cookie bombing or specially crafted AppCache manifests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code sample. It appears to be a test case for the Active Storage library and does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is always a good practice to keep the library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Consider updating the Active Storage library to the latest version.  ```bash
gem install activestorage -v 5.2.1.1
```  ```ruby
```bash
bundle update activestorage
```  ```ruby
```bash
rails active_storage:update
```  ```ruby
```bash
rails db:migrate
```  ```ruby
```bash
rails db:seed
```  ```ruby
```bash
