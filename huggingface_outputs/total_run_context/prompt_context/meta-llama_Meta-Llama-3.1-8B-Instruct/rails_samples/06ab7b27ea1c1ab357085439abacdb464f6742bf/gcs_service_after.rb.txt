 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the code does not properly validate the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters, which can be modified by an attacker to execute inline HTML files. Additionally, if combined with other techniques, an attacker can gain access to private signed URLs within a specific storage path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Active Storage version to 5.2.1.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Validate the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters before storing them as object's metadata.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve files, such as using a secure protocol like HTTPS.
