 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the code is using the `bucket.create_file` method to create a file with an inferred Content-Type, which can be controlled via the response-content-type param in signed URLs. This allows an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters, which can be used in conjunction with other techniques to gain access to private signed URLs within a specific storage path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the Active Storage version to 5.2.1.1 or later.
- Use the `bucket.create_file` method with the `content_type` parameter set to a specific value, rather than relying on the inferred Content-Type.
- Consider using a more secure method to control the Content-Type of the file, such as using a custom metadata field.  ```ruby
