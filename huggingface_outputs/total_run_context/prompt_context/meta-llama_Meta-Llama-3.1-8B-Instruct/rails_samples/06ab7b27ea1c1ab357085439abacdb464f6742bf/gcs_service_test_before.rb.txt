 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could be used to bypass the Active Storage vulnerability. The test is designed to verify that the signed URL generation is working correctly, and it does not contain any code that could be used to modify the `content-disposition` or `content-type` parameters in a way that would allow an attacker to execute inline HTML files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the Active Storage version is up-to-date, as the vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.2.1.1. Additionally, it is recommended to follow best practices for secure coding and testing to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
