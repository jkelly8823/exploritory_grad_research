 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. This is because the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify them and execute inline HTML files. Additionally, the use of `content_disposition_with` method does not provide sufficient protection against this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Active Storage to version 5.2.1.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Sanitize the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters before passing them to the `url_helpers.rails_disk_service_url` method.
3. Consider using a more secure method to generate URLs, such as using a secure token or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. 4. Review and update the `content_disposition_with` method to ensure it properly sanitizes the `content-disposition` parameter. 5. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as validating user input and checking for suspicious activity. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date.
