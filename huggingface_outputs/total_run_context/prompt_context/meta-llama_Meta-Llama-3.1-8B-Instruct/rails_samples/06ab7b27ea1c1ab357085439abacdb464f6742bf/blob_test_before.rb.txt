 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could be used to bypass the Active Storage vulnerability. The code is focused on testing the behavior of the `expected_url_for` method, which is designed to generate URLs for serving blobs. The method takes into account the content type and disposition of the blob, and generates a URL that includes the blob's key, content type, and disposition. The code does not contain any code that could be used to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters in a way that would allow an attacker to execute inline HTML files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to ensure that the `expected_url_for` method is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security issues. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
