 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters. The code is a simple interface for uploading and downloading files, and does not appear to be vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability described in CVE-2018-16477.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is worth noting that the `upload` and `download` methods are currently unimplemented and will raise a `NotImplementedError` when called. This should be addressed in a future update.  ```ruby
