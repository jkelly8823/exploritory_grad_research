 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. The `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify them and execute inline HTML files. This is evident in the `showing blob inline` test, where the `Content-Disposition` header is set to include a `filename` parameter, which can be used to execute inline HTML files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Active Storage to version 5.2.1.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Sanitize the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters to prevent modification by attackers.
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as validating user input and checking for suspicious requests.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-16477
