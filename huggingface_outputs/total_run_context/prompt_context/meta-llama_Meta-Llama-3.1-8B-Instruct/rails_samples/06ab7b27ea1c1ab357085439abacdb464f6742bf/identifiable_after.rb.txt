 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services. The issue arises from the fact that the `content-type` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify it and execute inline HTML files. This is a critical vulnerability that has been fixed in version 5.2.1.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the Active Storage version to 5.2.1.1 or later.
- Sanitize the `content-type` parameter to prevent any malicious input.
- Implement additional security measures such as cookie bombing protection and AppCache manifest validation to prevent further exploitation.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-16477
CVE Description:
A bypass vulnerability in Active Storage >= 5.2.0 for Google Cloud Storage and Disk services allow an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters which can be used in with HTML files and have them executed inline.
