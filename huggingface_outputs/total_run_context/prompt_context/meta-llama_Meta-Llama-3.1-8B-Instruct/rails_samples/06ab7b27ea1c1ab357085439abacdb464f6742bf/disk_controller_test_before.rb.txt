 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the bypass vulnerability described in CVE-2018-16477. The code is using the `ActiveStorage::DiskControllerTest` class to test the behavior of the `ActiveStorage` gem, and it does not appear to be modifying the `content-disposition` or `content-type` parameters in a way that would allow an attacker to execute inline code. Additionally, the code is not using any techniques such as cookie bombing or specially crafted AppCache manifests that could be used to gain access to private signed URLs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix the vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep the `ActiveStorage` gem up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.
