 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-16477 vulnerability because it allows an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters which can be used in with HTML files and have them executed inline. This is due to the `forcibly_serve_as_binary?? :attachment : disposition` line in the `service_url` method, which can be exploited to bypass the security checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the `service_url` method to always serve files as binary, regardless of the `forcibly_serve_as_binary?` flag.
- Remove the `disposition` parameter from the `service_url` method to prevent attackers from modifying it.
- Update the `ActiveStorage` gem to the latest version, which includes the fix for CVE-2018-16477. 
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as validating user input and checking for suspicious file types.  ```ruby
def service_url(expires_in: ActiveStorage.service_urls_expire_in, **options)
  filename = ActiveStorage::Filename.wrap(self.filename)

  service.url key, expires_in: expires_in, filename: filename, content
