 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability. The function _url_host_allowed? checks if the host of a given URL is the same as the current request host or if the URL is a relative path. However, it does not properly validate the URL, allowing an attacker to bypass the check by providing a carefully crafted URL. This could result in an open redirect vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the URL before checking its host. This can be achieved by using a library like Rack::Utils::HTTP_SAFE_URL_REGEXP to validate the URL. Additionally, the code should be updated to handle cases where the URL is not a string.

An open redirect vulnerability is fixed in Rails 7.0.4.1 with the new protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted user input.
