 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability. The redirect_back_or_to method is called with an untrusted user input, which is the URL "http://www.rubyonrails.org/". This allows an attacker to bypass the protection against open redirects by providing a carefully crafted URL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the allow_other_host parameter to prevent open redirects. For example, change the line to: redirect_back_or_to "http://www.rubyonrails.org/", status: 307, allow_other_host: true. Alternatively, use the redirect_to method with the only_path parameter set to true to prevent open redirects. For example: redirect_to "http://www.rubyonrails.org/", only_path: true.
