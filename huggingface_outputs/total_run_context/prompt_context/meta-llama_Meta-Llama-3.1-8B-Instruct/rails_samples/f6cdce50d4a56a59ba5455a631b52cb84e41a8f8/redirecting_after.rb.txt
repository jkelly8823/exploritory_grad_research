 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an open redirect vulnerability. The function _url_host_allowed? is designed to check if a URL is allowed to be redirected to. However, it does not properly validate the URL, allowing an attacker to bypass the check by providing a carefully crafted URL. This can result in an open redirect vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust URL validation library, such as `uri_parser` or `url_validator`, to ensure that the URL is properly parsed and validated.
2. Implement a whitelist of allowed hosts to prevent redirects to unauthorized domains.
3. Use a secure redirect method, such as `redirect_to` with a secure protocol (HTTPS), to prevent open redirects.

CVE Description: 
An open redirect vulnerability is fixed in Rails 7.0.4.1 with the new protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted user input. In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing trusted input. However the check introduced could allow an attacker to bypass with a carefully crafted URL resulting in an open redirect vulnerability
