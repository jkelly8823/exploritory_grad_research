VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5, 7, 9, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code contains several instances of potential open redirect vulnerabilities. The redirect_to method is used with untrusted user input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the protection against open redirects. This is particularly evident in the unsafe_redirect, unsafe_redirect_protocol_relative_double_slash, and unsafe_redirect_protocol_relative_triple_slash methods, where the redirect_to method is used with protocol-relative URLs. Additionally, the only_path_redirect method uses the redirect_to method with the only_path parameter set to true, which could also be exploited. The safe_redirect_to_root method is not vulnerable, as it uses the url_from method to generate a trusted URL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, the redirect_to method should be used with trusted user input, or the allow_other_host parameter should be set to true to allow redirects to other hosts. Additionally, the only_path parameter should be set to false to prevent protocol-relative URLs from being used. The safe_redirect_to_root method should be modified to use the redirect_to method with trusted user input. The following code snippets demonstrate the recommended fixes:
```ruby
