 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2011-0449 because it does not properly handle case sensitivity when resolving templates. In the first method, the template name is passed as a symbol with the correct case, but in the second method, the template name is passed as a string with the wrong case. This can allow an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions by using an unintended case for alphabetic characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use the correct case when passing the template name as a symbol.
- Use the correct case when passing the template name as a string.
- Consider using a case-insensitive filesystem to avoid this issue. However, this may introduce other security risks. 
- Use the `render` method with the `:template` option to specify the template name, which can help to avoid this issue. For example: `render :template => "hello_world"`. 
- Consider using a more secure way to handle template names, such as using a whitelist of allowed template names.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
