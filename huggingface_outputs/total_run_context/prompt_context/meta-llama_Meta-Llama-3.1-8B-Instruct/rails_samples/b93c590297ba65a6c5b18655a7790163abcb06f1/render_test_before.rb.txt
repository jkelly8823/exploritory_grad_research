 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions via an action name that uses an unintended case for alphabetic characters. The render method is used with a string parameter, which does not allow for case-insensitive matching of action names.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure against this vulnerability. However, it is worth noting that the code is using the deprecated render method with a string parameter. It would be better to use the render method with a symbol parameter, like this: render :action => :hello_world. This would make the code more consistent and easier to read.  ```ruby
render :action => :hello_world
