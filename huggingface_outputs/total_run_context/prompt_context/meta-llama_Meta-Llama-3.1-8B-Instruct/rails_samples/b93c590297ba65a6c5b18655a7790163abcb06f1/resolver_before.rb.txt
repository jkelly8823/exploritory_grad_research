 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2011-0449 because it does not properly implement filters associated with the list of available templates. This is due to the fact that the query string is constructed by joining the extensions with commas, which can lead to unintended case sensitivity issues when the filesystem is case-insensitive. An attacker can exploit this by providing an action name that uses an unintended case for alphabetic characters, allowing them to bypass intended access restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a case-insensitive approach when constructing the query string, such as using the `downcase` method to ensure that the extensions are always in the same case.
2. Consider using a more robust approach to constructing the query string, such as using a parameterized query or a library that handles case sensitivity issues for you.
3. Ensure that the filesystem is case-sensitive to prevent this type of vulnerability. If this is not possible, consider using a case-insensitive filesystem that is designed to handle these types of issues.
