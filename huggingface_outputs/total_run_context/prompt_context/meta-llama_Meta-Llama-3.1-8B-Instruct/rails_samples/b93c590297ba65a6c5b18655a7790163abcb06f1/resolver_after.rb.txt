 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2011-0449 because it does not properly implement filters associated with the list of available templates. The issue arises from the fact that the code uses a case-insensitive filesystem, which allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions via an action name that uses an unintended case for alphabetic characters. Specifically, the line `query.gsub!(/\{\.html,/, "{.html,.text.html,")` and `query.gsub!(/\{\.text,/, "{.text,.text.plain,")` are vulnerable because they do not account for the case sensitivity of the filesystem. This allows an attacker to access templates that are not intended to be accessible.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a case-sensitive filesystem to prevent this vulnerability.
2. Update the code to properly implement filters associated with the list of available templates, taking into account the case sensitivity of the filesystem.
3. Use a more secure method to access templates, such as using a whitelist of allowed templates.
