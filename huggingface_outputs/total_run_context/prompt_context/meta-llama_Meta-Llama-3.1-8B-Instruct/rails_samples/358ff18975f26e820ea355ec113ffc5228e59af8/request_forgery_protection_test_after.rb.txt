 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8166 because it does not properly handle the authenticity token. The test cases show that the token is not properly masked or unmasked, which makes it possible for an attacker to forge a per-form CSRF token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Rails to version 5.2.5 or higher, or version 6.0.4 or higher.
- Use a secure token generation library to ensure that the authenticity token is properly masked and unmasked.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent CSRF attacks, such as using a token-based authentication system.  ```python
def detect_vulnerability(code):
    # Check for the presence of the vulnerability
    if "form_authenticity_token" in code and "unmask_token" in code and "mask_token" in code:
        return "YES", "None", "The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8166 because it does not properly handle the authenticity token."
    else:
        return "NO", "None", "The code is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-8166."
