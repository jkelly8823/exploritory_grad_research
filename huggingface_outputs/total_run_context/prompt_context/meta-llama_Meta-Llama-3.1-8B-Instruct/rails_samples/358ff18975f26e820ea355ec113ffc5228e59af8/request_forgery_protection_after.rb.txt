 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8166 because it does not properly validate the authenticity token. The authenticity token is generated using a global CSRF token, which can be forged by an attacker. The code checks if the masked token matches the session token, but it does not check if the masked token is generated using the global CSRF token. This allows an attacker to forge a per-form CSRF token using the global CSRF token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the authenticity token by checking if it is generated using the global CSRF token.
2. Use a secure method to generate the per-form CSRF token, such as using a random token or a token generated using a secure random number generator.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and verify the CSRF token, such as using a secure cookie or a token stored in a secure storage.
