 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The decode_credentials method in the provided code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. This is because it converts Digest Authentication strings to symbols, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is present in the lines 7-9 of the code, where the header is being processed and converted to a hash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the decode_credentials method should be modified to handle the Digest Authentication strings correctly. This can be achieved by removing the conversion to symbols and instead using a more secure method to process the authentication credentials. Additionally, the authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest method should be reviewed and modified to prevent the denial of service attack.
