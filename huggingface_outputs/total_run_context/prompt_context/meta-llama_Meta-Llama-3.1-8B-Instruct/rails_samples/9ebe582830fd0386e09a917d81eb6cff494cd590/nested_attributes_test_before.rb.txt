 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2010-3933 because it does not properly handle nested attributes. This allows remote attackers to modify arbitrary records by changing the names of parameters for form inputs. The vulnerability is present in the following lines of code: 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, and 45. These lines of code are using the `reload` method to update the associated model, which can be exploited to modify arbitrary records.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `update_attributes` method instead of `reload` to update the associated model. This will prevent remote attackers from modifying arbitrary records. Additionally, you should validate the input parameters to ensure that they are not being tampered with. You can use the `params.require` method to validate the input parameters. For example: `@pirate.update_attributes(pirate_attributes: params.require(:pirate_attributes))`. This will ensure that the input parameters are valid and cannot be tampered with.
