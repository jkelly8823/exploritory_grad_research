 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Broken Access Control vulnerability because it uses GlobalID::Locator.locate to deserialize user input. This allows an attacker to craft user input that can be used to access information that they should not have. The vulnerability is present in the line where GlobalID::Locator.locate is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to prevent deserialization of user input. This can be done by using a whitelist of permitted types and checking if the argument is in the whitelist before attempting to deserialize it. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a secure deserialization method, such as using a secure deserialization library or implementing a custom deserialization method that is secure by design.
