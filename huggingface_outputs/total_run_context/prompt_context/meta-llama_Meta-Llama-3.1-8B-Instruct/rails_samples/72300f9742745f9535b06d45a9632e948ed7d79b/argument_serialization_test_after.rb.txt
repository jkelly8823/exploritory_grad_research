 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job versions >= 4.2.0. The vulnerability is present in the line where the `assert_arguments_roundtrip` method is called with the argument `[@person.to_gid.to_s]`. This line allows an attacker to deserialize the `@person` object using GlobalId, which can give them access to information that they should not have.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Active Job to a version that is not vulnerable (e.g., 4.2.11, 5.0.7.1, 5.1.6.1, or 5.2.1.1).
- Avoid using `GlobalId` to deserialize objects that may contain sensitive information.
- Use a secure deserialization mechanism, such as `JSON.parse` or `YAML.safe_load`, to deserialize objects. 
- Validate user input to prevent an attacker from crafting malicious input that can be deserialized using `GlobalId`.  ```ruby
