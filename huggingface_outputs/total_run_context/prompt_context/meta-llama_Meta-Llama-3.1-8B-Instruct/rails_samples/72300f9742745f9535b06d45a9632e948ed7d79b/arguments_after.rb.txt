 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Broken Access Control vulnerability because it uses the `deserialize_argument` method to deserialize user input. This method is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to craft user input that can be deserialized using GlobalId, giving them access to sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate user input before deserializing it.
- Use a secure deserialization method that does not use GlobalId.
- Update the code to use a version of Active Job that is not vulnerable to this issue.
