 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job. The `assert_arguments_roundtrip` method is called with an array containing a `@person` object, which can be deserialized using GlobalId. This allows an attacker to access information that they should not have.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Active Job to a version that is not vulnerable (e.g. 4.2.11, 5.0.7.1, 5.1.6.1, or 5.2.1.1).
- Use a secure deserialization mechanism, such as whitelisting or blacklisting, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. 
- Avoid using `assert_arguments_roundtrip` with untrusted input, as it can lead to deserialization of malicious data. 
- Consider using a more secure way to test the `assert_arguments_roundtrip` method, such as using a mock object or a test double.  ```ruby
