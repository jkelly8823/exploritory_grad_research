 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an XSS vulnerability due to the use of ERB::Util.html_escape() on user input. However, this is not the primary concern. The primary concern is the use of the translate method with a key ending in "_html" and a :default key which contains untrusted user input. This can lead to an XSS vulnerability when the resulting string is used in a view. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.3.1 and 7.0.8.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Rails version to 7.1.3.1 or 7.0.8.1 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Avoid using the translate method with a key ending in "_html" and a :default key which contains untrusted user input.
3. Use a secure method to escape user input, such as using a library like sanitize or a template engine like ERb. 
4. Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the translate method. 
5. Consider using a more secure translation method, such as using a translation library that supports secure translation.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
