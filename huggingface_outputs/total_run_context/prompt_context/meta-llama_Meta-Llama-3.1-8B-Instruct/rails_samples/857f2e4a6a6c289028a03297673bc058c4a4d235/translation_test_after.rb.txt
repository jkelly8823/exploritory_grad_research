VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a set of test cases for the Rails framework, specifically testing the behavior of translation helpers in Action Controller. The code does not contain any user input or untrusted data that could potentially lead to an XSS vulnerability. The tests are designed to ensure that the translation helpers behave correctly in various scenarios, including when using the "_html" key and when raising an exception. The code does not use the translation methods in a way that would make it susceptible to the CVE-2024-26143 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to keep the Rails framework up-to-date, as the vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.1.3.1 and 7.0.8.1. Additionally, it is always a good practice to follow secure coding guidelines and best practices when writing code.  The code does not contain any obvious security issues, but it is always a good idea to review the code and ensure that it meets the required security standards.
