 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `sub` method. The regular expression `/\D+/` can cause the input validation to spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This is a known vulnerability in the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the regular expression with a more efficient and secure alternative, such as using a simple string method to remove non-digit characters. For example:
```ruby
value = value.sub(/^\((.+)\)$/, '-\1')
value = value.gsub(/[^-\d.]/, "")
```
This will prevent the REDoS vulnerability and improve the performance of the code. Additionally, consider using a more robust input validation library to handle user input.```ruby
