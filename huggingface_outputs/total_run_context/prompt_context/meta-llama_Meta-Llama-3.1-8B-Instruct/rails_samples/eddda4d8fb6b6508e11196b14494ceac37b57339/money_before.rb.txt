 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `sub` method. The regular expression `/\D/` is used to match any non-digit character, which can cause the regular expression to spend too much time in a loop if the input is carefully crafted. This is a known vulnerability in the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the regular expression with a more efficient one, such as using a character class or a negative lookahead. For example, you can use `/\D/ => ''` instead of `/\D/ => '-'`. Additionally, consider using a more robust input validation mechanism to prevent DoS attacks.
