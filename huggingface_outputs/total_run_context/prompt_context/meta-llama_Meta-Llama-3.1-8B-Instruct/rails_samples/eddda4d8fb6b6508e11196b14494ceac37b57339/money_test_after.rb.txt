 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `money` type of the PostgreSQL adapter in Active Record. The regular expression is used to validate user input, and carefully crafted input can cause the input validation to spend too much time in the regular expression, resulting in a potential DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a more efficient validation method that does not rely on regular expressions.
- Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input, where only a specific set of allowed characters are accepted.
- Update the PostgreSQL adapter to a version that includes the fix for this vulnerability (Active Record 6.1.2.1, 6.0.3.5, 5.2.4.5).
