 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability due to the use of the `money` type in the PostgreSQL adapter. The `money` type is vulnerable to carefully crafted input that can cause the input validation to spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in a potential DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to Active Record 6.1.2.1 or later, or 6.0.3.5 or later, or 5.2.4.5 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Avoid using the `money` type in the PostgreSQL adapter if possible.
- If using the `money` type, ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent REDoS attacks.  ```ruby
# Fix: Upgrade to Active Record 6.1.2.1 or later
gem 'activerecord', '6.1.2.1'
```  ```ruby
# Fix: Avoid using the `money` type in the PostgreSQL adapter
# Remove the `money` type from the PostgreSQL adapter
```  ```ruby
# Fix: Sanitize
