 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-20907 due to the lack of header validation in the _proc_pax function in Lib/tarfile.py. This allows an attacker to craft a TAR archive that leads to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open. The code attempts to read from a TAR archive using tar.extractfile(t).read() and also attempts to open a TAR archive with a zero-length header using tarfile.open(support.findfile('recursion.tar')). This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Python version to 3.8.4 or later, which includes the fix for CVE-2019-20907.
2. Validate the TAR archive headers before attempting to read or open them.
3. Use a secure method to handle TAR archives, such as using a library that has built-in header validation. 4. Avoid using the tarfile module for untrusted input. 5. Consider using a safer alternative to tarfile, such as the pyparsing library. 6. Regularly update and patch the Python installation to ensure that
