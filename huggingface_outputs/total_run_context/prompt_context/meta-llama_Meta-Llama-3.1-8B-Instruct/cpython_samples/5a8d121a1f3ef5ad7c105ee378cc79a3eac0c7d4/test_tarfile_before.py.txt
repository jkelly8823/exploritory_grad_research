 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-20907 because it attempts to read from a tar archive without validating its contents. This can lead to an infinite loop when the archive is malformed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the tar archive contents before attempting to read from it.
2. Use a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur during the extraction process. 
3. Consider using a safer method to extract the archive, such as using the `tarfile.TarFile` class with the `extractall` method. 
4. Ensure that the `tarfile` module is up-to-date to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.  ```python
try:
    with tarfile.TarFile(t) as tar:
        tar.extractall()
except tarfile.ReadError as e:
    if "unexpected end of data" in str(e):
        raise
    else:
        # Handle other exceptions
        pass
