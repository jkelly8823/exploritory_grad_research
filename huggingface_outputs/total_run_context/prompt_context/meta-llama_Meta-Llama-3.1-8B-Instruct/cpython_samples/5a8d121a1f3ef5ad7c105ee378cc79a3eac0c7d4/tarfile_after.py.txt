 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an infinite loop when opening a TAR archive due to the lack of header validation in _proc_pax. This is a known issue in Python through 3.8.3. The code attempts to read a TAR archive, but it does not properly validate the header, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious archive that will cause the program to enter an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Python to a version greater than 3.8.3 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional header validation in the code to prevent the infinite loop.
3. Use a safe and secure method to read TAR archives, such as using a library that has built-in header validation.

CVE_ID:CVE-2019-20907
CVE Description:
In Lib/tarfile.py in Python through 3.8.3, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because _proc_pax lacks header validation.  VULNERABLE: YES
