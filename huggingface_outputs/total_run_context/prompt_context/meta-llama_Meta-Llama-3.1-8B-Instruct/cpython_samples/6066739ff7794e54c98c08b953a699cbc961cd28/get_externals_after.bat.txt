 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is checking for the existence of external libraries and skipping them if they already exist. The vulnerability described in CVE-2018-25032 is related to the zlib library, but the code is using zlib-1.2.12 which is not vulnerable according to the CVE description. Additionally, the code is not compressing or decompressing any data using zlib, it is simply listing the libraries.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it would be a good practice to ensure that the external libraries are properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential issues.
