 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is checking for the existence of external libraries and skipping them if they already exist. The vulnerability described in CVE-2018-25032 is related to the zlib library, but the code is not using the zlib library in a way that would trigger the vulnerability. The code is simply setting the zlib library to version 1.2.11, which is an older version that is not vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this issue and does not require any changes. However, it may be worth considering updating the zlib library to a more recent version to ensure that any other potential vulnerabilities are addressed.
