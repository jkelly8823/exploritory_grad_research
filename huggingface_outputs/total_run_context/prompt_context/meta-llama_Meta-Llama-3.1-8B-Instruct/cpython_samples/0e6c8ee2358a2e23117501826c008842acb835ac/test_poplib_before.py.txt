 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1060 due to the use of the apop() method in the test_apop() function. The apop() method is known to be vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the apop() method with a secure alternative, such as using the POP3 protocol directly. This can be achieved by using the POP3 class from the email package. For example:
```
from email import poplib

def test_apop(self):
    self.assertOK(self.client.poplib().apop('foo', 'dummypassword'))
``` VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1060 CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1061 CVE Description:python before versions 2.7.15, 3.4.9, 3.5.6rc1, 3.6.5rc1 and 3.7.0 is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking in pop3lib's apop() method. An attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service.
