 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking in the apop() method due to the use of a very long evil welcome message. This is a known vulnerability in python versions before 2.7.15, 3.4.9, 3.5.6rc1, 3.6.5rc1 and 3.7.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a version of python that is not vulnerable to this issue.
- If upgrading is not possible, consider using a different library or implementation that is not affected by this vulnerability. 
- If the code is intended to handle very long welcome messages, consider implementing a mechanism to prevent catastrophic backtracking, such as a timeout or a limit on the length of the welcome message.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
