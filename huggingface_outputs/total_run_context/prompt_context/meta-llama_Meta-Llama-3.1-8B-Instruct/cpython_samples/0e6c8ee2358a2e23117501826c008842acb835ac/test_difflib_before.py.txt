 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that uses the pop3lib's apop() method or the difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK method. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1060 and CVE-2018-1061 vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that uses the vulnerable methods, so no fixes are necessary. However, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest versions of the libraries used to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future.  The code does use difflib, but it does not use the IS_LINE_JUNK method. It does use the HtmlDiff class, but the _default_prefix attribute is set to 0, which is not a vulnerable version.  The code does use the doctest library, but it does not use the apop() method.  The code does use the run_unittest function, but it does not use the difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK method.  The code does use the TestWithAscii, TestAutojunk, TestSFpatches, TestSFbugs, TestOutputFormat, TestBytes, and
