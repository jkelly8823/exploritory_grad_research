 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1061 due to the catastrophic backtracking in the difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK method. The difflib module is not used in this code, but the function IS_LINE_JUNK is implemented in a similar way, which can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more efficient regular expression that does not use the match function.
2. Avoid using the re module for this function as it can lead to catastrophic backtracking.
3. Implement a more efficient way to check for ignorable lines, such as using the str.isspace() method.
