 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any instances of the vulnerabilities CVE-2018-1060 and CVE-2018-1061. The code is using the difflib module, but it is not using the apop() method or the difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK method in a way that would be susceptible to catastrophic backtracking. The code is also not using any versions of python that are known to be vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to these issues. However, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest versions of python and the difflib module to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are addressed. Additionally, it is recommended to use a linter and a code analysis tool to catch any potential issues before they become a problem.  The difflib module is being used in a way that is consistent with its intended use, and the code is not attempting to use any of the methods in a way that would be susceptible to catastrophic backtracking. The code is also not using any deprecated or removed methods that could potentially cause issues.  The code is well-structured and follows good
