 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-27043 due to the incorrect parsing of e-mail addresses that contain special characters. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to bypass protection mechanisms that rely on email verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Python version to the latest version (3.11.4 or higher) which includes the fix for CVE-2023-27043.
2. Use the `email.utils.parseaddr()` function with the `strict=False` parameter to tolerate malformed email addresses.
3. Implement additional validation and sanitization of email addresses to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-27043
CVE Description:
The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mail addresses that contain a special character. The wrong portion of an RFC2822 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This occurs in
