VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential exception handling issue. The code catches a socket.error exception and then raises an SMTPServerDisconnected exception. This can lead to a situation where the exception is caught and then immediately re-raised, potentially masking the original error and making it difficult to diagnose the issue. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where the readline() method returns an empty string, which can occur if the connection is closed before the server has a chance to read the response.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the re-raising of the SMTPServerDisconnected exception. Instead, let the original socket.error exception propagate up the call stack.
2. Add a check to ensure that the readline() method returns a non-empty string before attempting to process it.
3. Consider using a more specific exception type, such as ConnectionResetError, to handle the case where the connection is closed unexpectedly. This can provide more information about the nature of the error and make it easier to diagnose the issue.
