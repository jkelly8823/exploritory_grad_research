 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string formatting to insert user input into the database query. The variable'sim_users' is a dictionary where the keys are email addresses and the values are user names. However, the code does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, you can use the'sqlite3' module's 'paramstyle' feature to parameterize the query. Alternatively, you can use an ORM like 'SQLAlchemy' to abstract away the underlying database and prevent SQL injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. SQL Injection
    - Description: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of string formatting to insert user input into the database query.
    - Severity: High
    - Recommendation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
    - Fix: Replace the string formatting with parameterized queries or prepared statements. 
2. Potential Data Exposure
    - Description: The code stores sensitive information such as email addresses and
