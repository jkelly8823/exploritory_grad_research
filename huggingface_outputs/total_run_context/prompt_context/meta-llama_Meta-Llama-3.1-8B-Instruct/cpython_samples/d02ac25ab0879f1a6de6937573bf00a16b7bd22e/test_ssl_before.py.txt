 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is using the `ssl.MemoryBIO()` class to create memory-based BIO objects, which is a secure way to handle SSL/TLS connections. The `server_hostname` parameter is being set to a valid hostname, which is also secure. The `with` statement is being used to catch any potential exceptions, including the `ValueError` that is being raised when the `ctx.wrap_bio()` method is called with an invalid hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to regularly review your code for potential security issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-8970
CVE Description:
The int_x509_param_set_hosts function in lib/libcrypto/x509/x509_vpm.c in LibreSSL 2.7.0 before 2.7.1 does not support a certain special case of a zero name length, which causes silent omission of hostname verification, and consequently allows man-in
