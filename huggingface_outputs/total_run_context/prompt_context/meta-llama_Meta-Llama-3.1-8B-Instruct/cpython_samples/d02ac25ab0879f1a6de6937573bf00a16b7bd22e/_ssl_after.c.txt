 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-8970 because it does not properly handle the case where the server hostname is an empty string. This allows an attacker to bypass hostname verification and potentially obtain sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the server hostname is an empty string before passing it to X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host.
2. If the server hostname is empty, handle it as a special case and do not pass it to X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host.
3. Consider using a more robust hostname verification mechanism that can handle edge cases like empty hostnames. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-8970
CVE Description:
The int_x509_param_set_hosts function in lib/libcrypto/x509/x509_vpm.c in LibreSSL 2.7.0 before 2.7.1 does not support a certain special case of a zero name length, which causes silent omission of hostname verification, and consequently allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate. NOTE: the LibreSSL documentation indicates that this special case is supported, but
