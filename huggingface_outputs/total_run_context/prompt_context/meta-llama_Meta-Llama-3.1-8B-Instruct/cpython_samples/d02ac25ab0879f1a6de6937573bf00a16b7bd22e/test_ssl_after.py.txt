 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any instances of the suspected vulnerability CVE-2018-8970. The code is using the `server_hostname` parameter correctly, and it is not attempting to set a hostname with a zero name length. The `wrap_bio` method is also correctly handling the `server_hostname` parameter, raising a `ValueError` when an invalid hostname is provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to address the suspected vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the `server_hostname` parameter is always provided with a valid hostname to prevent potential issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-8970
CVE Description:
The int_x509_param_set_hosts function in lib/libcrypto/x509/x509_vpm.c in LibreSSL 2.7.0 before 2.7.1 does not support a certain special case of a zero name length, which causes silent omission of hostname verification, and consequently allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate. NOTE: the LibreSSL documentation indicates that this special case is
