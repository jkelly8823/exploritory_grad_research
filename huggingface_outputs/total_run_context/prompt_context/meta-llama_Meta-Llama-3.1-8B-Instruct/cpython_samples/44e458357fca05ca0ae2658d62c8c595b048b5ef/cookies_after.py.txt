 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code uses a regular expression to unquote special characters in a string, which is a more efficient approach than the quadratic complexity algorithm used in the vulnerable CPython implementation. The code also uses a sub function to replace the matched characters, which is a common approach in regular expression processing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described vulnerability.  However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it meets the requirements and is free from any other potential issues.
