 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 20-22, 25-27
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-7592 vulnerability because it uses the 'http.cookies' standard library module to parse cookies, which has a quadratic complexity algorithm for parsing cookie values containing backslashes for quoted characters. This can lead to excess CPU resources being used while parsing the value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of CPython that has fixed this vulnerability.
2. Use a secure alternative to the 'http.cookies' module, such as a third-party library that uses a more efficient algorithm for parsing cookies.
3. Implement a custom cookie parsing function that uses a more efficient algorithm to avoid the quadratic complexity issue. 
4. Limit the size of cookie values to prevent excessive CPU usage. 
5. Consider using a secure cookie parsing library that is designed to handle large cookie values efficiently. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 7. Consider using a secure coding practice such as input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from causing issues. 8. Use a secure protocol for transmitting cookies, such as
