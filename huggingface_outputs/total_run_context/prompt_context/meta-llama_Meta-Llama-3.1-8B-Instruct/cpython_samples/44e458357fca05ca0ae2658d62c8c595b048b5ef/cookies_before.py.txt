 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-7592 vulnerability because it uses the
http.cookies standard library module, which is affected by this issue. The
code parses cookies that contain backslashes for quoted characters in the
cookie value, which can lead to excess CPU resources being used while parsing
the value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the http.cookies standard library module to the latest version
   that addresses this vulnerability.
2. Use a more efficient algorithm for parsing cookies, such as the one
   implemented in the latest version of the http.cookies module.
3. Consider using a third-party library that provides a more efficient and
   secure way of parsing cookies. 
4. If possible, avoid parsing cookies that contain backslashes for quoted
   characters, as this can lead to performance issues. 
5. Consider implementing a fallback mechanism to handle cookies that
   contain backslashes for quoted characters, such as ignoring them or
   replacing them with a safe character. 
6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and
   efficient.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
