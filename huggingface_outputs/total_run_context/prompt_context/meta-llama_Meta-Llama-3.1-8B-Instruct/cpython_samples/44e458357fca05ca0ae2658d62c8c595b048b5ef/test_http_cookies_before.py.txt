 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-7592 vulnerability because it uses the 'http.cookies' standard library module to parse cookies. The 'load' method of the 'SimpleCookie' class is used to parse the cookie string, which can lead to quadratic complexity when parsing cookie values containing backslashes for quoted characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of CPython that has fixed this vulnerability.
2. Use a secure cookie parsing library that is not affected by this vulnerability.
3. Implement a custom cookie parsing function that avoids the quadratic complexity issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
Apache Log4j is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability due to a
JNDI lookup in the log message. This vulnerability is caused by the use of the
'${' syntax in the log message, which allows an attacker to inject malicious
code.

Code Sample:
import logging
from logging.config import dictConfig

dictConfig({
   'version': 1,
    'formatters': {
        'default': {
            'format':
