 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the parsing of X.400 addresses or the use of the OpenSSL library in a way that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2023-0286 vulnerability. The code appears to be a script that sets environment variables for building software packages, and does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the type confusion vulnerability described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2023-0286 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep software packages up to date and to use secure coding practices when writing code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-0286
CVE Description:
There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an
ASN1
