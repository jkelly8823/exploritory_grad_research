 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the CVE-2023-0286 vulnerability. The code snippet appears to be a configuration for building and installing OpenSSL 1.1.1s, but it does not include any code that processes X.400 addresses or uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could introduce the CVE-2023-0286 vulnerability, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and apply security patches as soon as they become available. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-0286
CVE Description:
There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an
ASN1_STRING.
