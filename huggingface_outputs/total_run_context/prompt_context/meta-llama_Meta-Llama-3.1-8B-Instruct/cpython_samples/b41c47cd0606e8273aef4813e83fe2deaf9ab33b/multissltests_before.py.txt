 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the type confusion vulnerability described in CVE-2023-0286. The code snippet appears to be a list of version numbers for OpenSSL and LibreSSL, which do not contain any code that could be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to CVE-2023-0286. However, it is recommended to ensure that any code that interacts with OpenSSL or LibreSSL is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  ```python
def validate_crl(crl):
    # Validate CRL
    pass

def check_x400_address(x400_address):
    # Check X.400 address
    pass
```VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-0286
CVE Description:
There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
