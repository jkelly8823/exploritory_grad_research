 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2010-2089 because it does not verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths. In the test_issue7673 method, the size argument is not validated before being passed to various audioop functions. This can lead to a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) when the size argument is invalid.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size argument before passing it to audioop functions to ensure it is within the valid range.
2. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle any exceptions raised by audioop functions due to invalid size arguments.
3. Consider using a more robust validation mechanism, such as checking the length of the byte string against the size argument. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2010-2089
CVE Description:
The audioop module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via crafted arguments, as demonstrated by a call to audioop.reverse with a one-byte string,
