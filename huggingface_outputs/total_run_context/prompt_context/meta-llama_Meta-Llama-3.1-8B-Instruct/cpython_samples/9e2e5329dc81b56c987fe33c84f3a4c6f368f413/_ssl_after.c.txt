 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is a known vulnerability in the SSL protocol, and it can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain plaintext HTTP headers. The code is using SSL_CTX_set_options to set the SSL protocol options, but it is not disabling the CBC mode, which is necessary to prevent the BEAST attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the CBC mode by setting the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 and SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 options.
2. Use a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or later, by setting the SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 option.
3. Consider using a more secure cipher suite, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-3389
CVE Description:
The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
