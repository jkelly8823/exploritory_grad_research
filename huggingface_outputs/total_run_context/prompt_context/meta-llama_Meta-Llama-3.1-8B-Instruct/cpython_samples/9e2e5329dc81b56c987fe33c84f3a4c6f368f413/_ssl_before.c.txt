 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the BEAST attack. The SSL protocol is being used with CBC mode, but the code does not use any of the APIs that are susceptible to the BEAST attack (HTML5 WebSocket API, Java URLConnection API, or Silverlight WebClient API). Additionally, the code does not use any chained initialization vectors, which are required for the BEAST attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the BEAST attack. However, it is always a good practice to keep the SSL/TLS protocol up to date and to use the latest security patches. Also, consider using the TLS 1.2 protocol, which is more secure than TLS 1.1. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-3389
CVE Description:
The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on
