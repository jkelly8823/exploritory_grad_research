 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the potential for a large token that requires multiple buffer fills. This is a known issue in libexpat through 2.5.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade libexpat to a version greater than 2.5.0 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Consider using a different XML parsing library that is not affected by this issue. 
3. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of the token being processed to prevent resource consumption. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-52425
CVE Description:
libexpat through 2.5.0 allows a denial of service (resource consumption) because many full reparsings are required in the case of a large token for which multiple buffer fills are needed.  ```python
