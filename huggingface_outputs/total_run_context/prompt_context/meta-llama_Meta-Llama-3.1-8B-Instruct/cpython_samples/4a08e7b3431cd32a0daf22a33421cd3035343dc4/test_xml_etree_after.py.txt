 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) because it uses the libexpat library, which is affected by CVE-2023-52425. This vulnerability can be triggered when a large token is encountered, requiring multiple buffer fills.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the libexpat library to a version greater than 2.5.0.
2. Consider using a different XML parsing library that is not affected by this vulnerability.
3. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of the token being processed to prevent resource consumption.
