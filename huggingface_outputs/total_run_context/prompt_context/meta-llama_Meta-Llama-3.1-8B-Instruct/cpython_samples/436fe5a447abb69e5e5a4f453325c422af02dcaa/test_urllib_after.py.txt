 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash in a CGI script. This is because the CGIHandler class in Python does not protect against this vulnerability. The line `self.env.set('NO_PROXY', 'localhost, anotherdomain.com, newdomain.com')` is the line where this vulnerability is present. This line is attempting to set the 'NO_PROXY' environment variable to exclude certain domains from proxying. However, this is not sufficient to prevent the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `urllib.request.getproxies_environment()` function to get the current proxy settings and then modify them as needed.
2. Avoid setting the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable directly. Instead, use the `urllib.request.getproxies_environment()` function to get the current proxy settings and then modify them as needed.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle proxy settings, such as using a configuration file or a secure storage mechanism. 
4. Update the Python version to 2.7.12 or later to fix this vulnerability. 
5. Use a library like `requests` which handles proxy settings securely. 6
