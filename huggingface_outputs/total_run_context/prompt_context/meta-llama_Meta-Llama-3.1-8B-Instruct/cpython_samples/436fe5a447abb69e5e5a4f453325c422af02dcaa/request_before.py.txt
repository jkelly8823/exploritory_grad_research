VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash in a CGI script. This is because the code does not protect against the variable name clash, allowing a remote attacker to redirect HTTP requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to set the proxy, such as using the `os.environ` dictionary to set the proxy environment variable.
2. Validate the input to prevent the variable name clash.
3. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to handle proxy settings, such as `requests` library.
