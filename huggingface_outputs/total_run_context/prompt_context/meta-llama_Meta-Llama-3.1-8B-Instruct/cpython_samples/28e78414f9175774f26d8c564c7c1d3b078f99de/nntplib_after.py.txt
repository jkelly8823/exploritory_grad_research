 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The line length limit is set to 2048, which is larger than the maximum allowed line length of 512 characters as per RFC 3977. This could potentially allow an attacker to send a maliciously crafted line that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reduce the line length limit to the maximum allowed by RFC 3977, which is 512 characters.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle line length limits, such as using a fixed-size buffer and checking the length of the incoming line before copying it into the buffer. 
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with relevant standards and best practices.  ```
