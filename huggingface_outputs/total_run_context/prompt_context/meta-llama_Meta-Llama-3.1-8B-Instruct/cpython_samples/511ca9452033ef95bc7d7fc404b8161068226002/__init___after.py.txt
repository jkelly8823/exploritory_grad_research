 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that directly uses the int() function with a non-binary base, which is the root cause of the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. The code does use sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to temporarily change the integer string conversion length limit, but this is not related to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. However, it's worth noting that the use of sys.set_int_max_str_digits() may have unintended consequences if not used carefully, as it can affect the behavior of other parts of the system. It's recommended to use this function with caution and only when necessary.  The code does use time.sleep() which could potentially be a performance issue if the delay is too long. Consider using a more efficient way to implement delays, such as using a scheduling library.  Consider adding a check to ensure that max_delay is not set to a value that could cause an overflow when multiplied by 2.  Consider adding a check to ensure that max_delay is not set to a value that could cause an overflow when multiplied by 2.
