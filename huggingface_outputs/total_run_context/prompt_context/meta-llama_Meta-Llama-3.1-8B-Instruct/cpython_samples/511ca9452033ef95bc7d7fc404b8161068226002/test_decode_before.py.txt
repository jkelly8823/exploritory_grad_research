 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability because it is using the int() function to parse a large string of digits. The int() function can take a long time to parse large strings, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The test_decimal method in the TestDecode class is attempting to parse a string of 42 'a' characters, which is a large string that can cause the int() function to take a long time to parse.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use a more efficient method to parse the string, such as using the int.from_bytes() function or a library like gmpy2 that is designed to handle large integers. You can also consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure to store and parse the large string. Additionally, you can add a timeout or rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks.
