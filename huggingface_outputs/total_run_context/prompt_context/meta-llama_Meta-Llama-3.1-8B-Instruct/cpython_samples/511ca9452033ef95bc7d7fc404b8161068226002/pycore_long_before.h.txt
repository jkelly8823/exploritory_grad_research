 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of the Python runtime lifecycle, specifically initializing types for the long integer type. The code does not contain any obvious references to parsing large integer strings, which is the primary concern of the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. The includes suggest that the code is using the Python core, but the specific functions and variables mentioned do not directly relate to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. However, it is essential to note that the code is part of the Python runtime lifecycle, and any modifications or additions should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2,
