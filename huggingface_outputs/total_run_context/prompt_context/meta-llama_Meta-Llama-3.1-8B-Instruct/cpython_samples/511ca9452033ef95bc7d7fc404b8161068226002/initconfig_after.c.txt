 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 123-125
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to denial of service attacks when parsing untrusted data due to the lack of input validation for the "PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS" environment variable. This variable is used to limit the size of int<->str conversions, but it can be set to an arbitrary value, potentially leading to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input for the "PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS" environment variable to ensure it is within a valid range (0 or a positive integer).
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed values or using a secure parsing library.
3. Document the potential security risks associated with this feature and provide guidance on how to use it securely. 4. Consider removing this feature altogether if it is not essential for the functionality of the code. 5. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent denial of service attacks. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard, such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices, to
