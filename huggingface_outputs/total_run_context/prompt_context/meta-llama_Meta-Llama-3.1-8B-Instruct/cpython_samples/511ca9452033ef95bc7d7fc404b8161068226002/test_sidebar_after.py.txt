 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. The issue described in the vulnerability is related to parsing large integers in algorithms with quadratic time complexity, but the code sample does not involve such an operation. It appears to be a test case for a Tkinter application, and the only integer operations involved are simple assignments and comparisons.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-10735. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to follow best practices for coding and testing.
