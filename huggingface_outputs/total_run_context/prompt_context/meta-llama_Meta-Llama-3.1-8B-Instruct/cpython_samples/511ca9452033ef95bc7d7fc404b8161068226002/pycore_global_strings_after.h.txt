 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is using a macro or function called STRUCT_FOR_ID, which is not a standard Python function. The vulnerability described in the CVE is related to the parsing of large integers in Python, which does not seem to be relevant to this code. The code is likely using a custom implementation of the STRUCT_FOR_ID macro or function, which is not affected by the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it would be beneficial to review the implementation of the STRUCT_FOR_ID macro or function to ensure it is secure and does not introduce any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure and well-tested library or framework for parsing and manipulating integers.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
