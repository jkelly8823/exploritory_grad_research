 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be affected by the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to parsing large integers in algorithms with quadratic time complexity, but the code sample does not contain any such algorithms. The code sample appears to be a test suite for a Python API, and it does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and maintained. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected).
