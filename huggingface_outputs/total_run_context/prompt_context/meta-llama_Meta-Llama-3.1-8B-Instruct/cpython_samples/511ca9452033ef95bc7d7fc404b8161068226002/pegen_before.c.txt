 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any Python code, but rather C code that interacts with the Python interpreter. The vulnerability CVE-2020-10735 is specific to Python's int() function and its performance impact on large integer parsing. Since the code sample does not use the int() function or any other affected Python function, it is not vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any Python code that could be affected by the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. However, if the code is intended to parse large integers in Python, it may be beneficial to consider using alternative methods that are not affected by this vulnerability, such as using the decimal module or a third-party library that provides efficient large integer parsing.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Log4j library handled log messages. An attacker could use this flaw to inject malicious data that would be interpreted by the application, leading to arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Code Sample:
#include <
