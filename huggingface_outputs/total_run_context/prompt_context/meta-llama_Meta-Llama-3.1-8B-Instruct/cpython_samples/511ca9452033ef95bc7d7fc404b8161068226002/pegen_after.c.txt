 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the 'c' parameter. An attacker could potentially provide a large input string that would cause the PyLong_FromString function to hit a length limit, leading to a ValueError exception. The code attempts to handle this exception by clearing the current exception and raising a new SyntaxError exception with a custom error message. However, this approach is not foolproof and could still lead to a denial-of-service attack if the input string is extremely large.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation to ensure that the 'c' parameter does not exceed a certain length limit.
2. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as using a try-except block to catch the ValueError exception and handle it in a more controlled manner.
3. Use a more efficient way to handle large numeric literals, such as using hexadecimal notation as suggested in the error message.
