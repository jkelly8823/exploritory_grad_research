 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. The vulnerability is related to parsing large integers in Python, but the code sample only deals with JSON decoding and does not involve parsing large integers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. However, it's worth noting that the code sample does not handle potential errors in JSON decoding, such as decoding invalid JSON. It's recommended to add error handling to make the code more robust. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

A flaw was found in Jackson-databind. When using the `@JsonInclude` annotation with the `value` set to `NON_DEFAULT`, it is possible to bypass the exclusion of default values. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

Code Sample:
from jackson import JsonInclude
from jackson.databind import ObjectMapper

class TestClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.default_value = "default"

    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Value.NON_DEFAULT)
