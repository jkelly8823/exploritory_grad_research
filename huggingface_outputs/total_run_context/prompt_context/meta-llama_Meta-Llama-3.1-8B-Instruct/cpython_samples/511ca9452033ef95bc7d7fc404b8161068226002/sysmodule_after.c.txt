 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. This vulnerability is related to the maximum string digits limit for non-binary int<->str conversions. The code does not properly handle the limit, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability is present in the sys.set_int_max_str_digits_impl function, where the maxdigits parameter is not properly validated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the maxdigits parameter to ensure it is within the valid range (0 to _PY_LONG_MAX_STR_DIGITS_THRESHOLD).
2. Consider adding a check to prevent the maxdigits parameter from being set to a value that is too large, which can cause a denial-of-service attack.
3. Update the code to properly handle the maximum string digits limit for non-binary int<->str conversions. This can be done by using a more robust algorithm or by implementing a limit on the number of digits that can be processed.
