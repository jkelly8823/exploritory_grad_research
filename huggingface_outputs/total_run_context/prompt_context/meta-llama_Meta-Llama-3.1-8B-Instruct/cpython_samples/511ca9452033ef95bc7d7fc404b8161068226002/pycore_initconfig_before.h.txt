def get_configs_as_dict():
    # This function is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735
    return {"configs": _Py_GetConfigsAsDict()}
``` ```c
PyAPI_FUNC(PyObject*) _Py_GetConfigsAsDict(void)
{
    // This function is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735
    PyObject* dict = PyDict_New();
    //...
    return dict;
}
``` ```c
PyAPI_FUNC(PyObject*) _Py_Get_Getpath_CodeObject(void)
{
    // This function is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735
