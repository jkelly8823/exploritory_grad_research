 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. The issue described in the vulnerability is related to parsing large integers in algorithms with quadratic time complexity, which is not relevant to this code sample. The code sample is using the tkinter library and testing the behavior of the idlelib.delegator.Delegator class, which does not involve parsing large integers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and consider using tools like linters and code analyzers to identify potential problems.
