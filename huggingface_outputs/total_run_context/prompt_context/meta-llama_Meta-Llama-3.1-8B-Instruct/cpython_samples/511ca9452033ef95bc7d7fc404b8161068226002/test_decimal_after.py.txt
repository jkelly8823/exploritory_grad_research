 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735 because it is modifying the maximum number of digits that can be parsed by the int() function. This is done in the setUp() method of the PyUsabilityTest and PyCoverage classes, where sys.set_int_max_str_digits(7000) is called. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if an attacker can cause the system to parse a large number of digits, potentially taking a long time to complete.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the lines that modify the maximum number of digits that can be parsed by the int() function.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle large integers, such as using the decimal module's Decimal class.
3. Consider adding input validation to prevent large integers from being passed to the int() function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100
