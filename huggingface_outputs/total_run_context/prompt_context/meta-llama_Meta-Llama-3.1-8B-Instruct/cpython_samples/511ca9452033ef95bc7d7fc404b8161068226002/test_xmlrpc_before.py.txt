 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the int() function to parse a large integer string, which can take a significant amount of time to process. The int() function is not affected by this vulnerability, but the code is using it to parse a string that is not a binary base, which is the cause of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the int() function with a binary base, such as int("text", 2) for a binary base of 2, or use a more efficient method to parse the integer string, such as using the decimal module's Decimal class.
