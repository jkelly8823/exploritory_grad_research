 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code appears to be using a macro or function called STRUCT_FOR_ID, which is not a standard Python function or macro. Without more context or information about the implementation of STRUCT_FOR_ID, it is impossible to determine if it is vulnerable to the described issue. However, based on the provided code sample alone, there is no indication of a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. However, it would be beneficial to investigate the implementation of STRUCT_FOR_ID to determine if it is vulnerable to the described issue. This could involve reviewing the source code or documentation for STRUCT_FOR_ID to determine its behavior and potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure alternative to STRUCT_FOR_ID if it is not designed to handle large inputs efficiently.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
