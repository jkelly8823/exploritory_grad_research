 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735 because it uses the eval() function to evaluate string expressions, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when processing large input strings. The eval() function is not designed to handle large inputs efficiently, and it can take a significant amount of time to parse large integers, potentially leading to a system availability issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the eval() function for security-sensitive operations.
2. Use a safer alternative, such as the built-in int() function, to parse integers from strings.
3. Consider using a library like numexpr or numba to evaluate mathematical expressions in a more efficient and secure way. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-1000338
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Python interpreter handled certain types of exceptions. When an exception occurred, the interpreter would attempt to print the exception message, but it would not properly handle the case where the exception message was a large string. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by causing the interpreter to consume excessive
