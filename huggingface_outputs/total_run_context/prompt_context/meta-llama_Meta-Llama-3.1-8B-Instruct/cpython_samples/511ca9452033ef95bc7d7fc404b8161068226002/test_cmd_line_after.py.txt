 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-10735. The code is a test suite for Python's int_max_str_digits feature, which is designed to prevent integer overflow attacks. The code is checking the behavior of the int_max_str_digits feature under various conditions, including setting it to different values and checking the results. The code does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a quadratic time complexity issue, which is the root cause of the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-10735. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date and follow best practices for secure coding. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (
