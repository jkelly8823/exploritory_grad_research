 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. This vulnerability is related to the parsing of large integers in the xmlrpc.client module. The check_loads function is used to parse the input, and it does not handle large integers correctly. The test_limit_int function tests the parsing of large integers, and it raises a ValueError when the input is too large. However, the test_get_host_info function does not check for large integers, which makes it vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the xmlrpc.client module to use a more efficient algorithm for parsing large integers.
2. Add a check in the check_loads function to handle large integers correctly.
3. Test the parsing of large integers in the test_get_host_info function to ensure that it is handled correctly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1
