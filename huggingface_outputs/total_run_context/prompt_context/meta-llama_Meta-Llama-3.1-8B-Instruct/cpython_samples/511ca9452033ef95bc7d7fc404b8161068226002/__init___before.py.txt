 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be affected by the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to parsing large integers in Python, which is not present in this code snippet. The code snippet is using a simple sleep function and updating a variable, which does not involve parsing integers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are not affected). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

Code Sample:

def calculate_total_cost(items):
    total_cost = 0
    for item in items:
        total_cost += item['price'] * item['quantity']
