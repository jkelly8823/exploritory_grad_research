 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735 because it uses the int() function with a non-binary base (32) on a string that contains underscores. The int() function is not designed to handle strings with underscores, and this can lead to a quadratic time complexity vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a library like numexpr or numpy to evaluate the expression instead of relying on the int() function. Alternatively, you can use a library like pyparsing to parse the string and then convert it to an integer. If you must use the int() function, consider using a binary base (2, 4, 8, 16, or 32) that is not affected by this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary
