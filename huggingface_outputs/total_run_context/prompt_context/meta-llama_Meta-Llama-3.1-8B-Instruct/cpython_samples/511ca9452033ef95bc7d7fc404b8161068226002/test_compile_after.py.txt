 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of eval() function which can execute arbitrary Python code. This can lead to a system crash or a significant slowdown. The eval() function is used in the test cases to evaluate the expressions "0o777" and "-0o0000010". This can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the eval() function whenever possible. Instead, use the built-in int() function to convert octal numbers.
2. Use a safer alternative to eval() such as ast.literal_eval() which only evaluates literals and does not execute arbitrary code.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from being executed. 
4. Consider using a more secure way to test the code, such as using a mock object or a test framework that supports mocking.
