 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. The vulnerability is present in the sys_set_int_max_str_digits function where it calls sys_set_int_max_str_digits_impl with an integer value. The sys_set_int_max_str_digits_impl function is not shown in the provided code, but based on the description of the vulnerability, it is likely that this function is the one that is vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the sys_set_int_max_str_digits_impl function is not designed to handle large integer values, and it can take a long time to parse an int string with a large number of digits. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the sys_set_int_max_str_digits_impl function should be modified to handle large integer values efficiently. This can be done by using a more efficient algorithm for parsing int strings, or by limiting the maximum number of digits that can be parsed. Additionally, the sys_set_int_max_str_digits function should be modified to check the value of maxdigits before passing it to sys_set_int_max_str_digits_impl to prevent denial of service attacks.
