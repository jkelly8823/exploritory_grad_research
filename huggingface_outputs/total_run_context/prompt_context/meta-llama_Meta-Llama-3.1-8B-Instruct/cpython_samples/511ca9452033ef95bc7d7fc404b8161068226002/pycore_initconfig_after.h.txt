 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any code that would be affected by the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to parsing large integers in Python, which is not present in this code sample. The code appears to be related to Python's internal implementation and does not involve parsing large integers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to integer parsing, especially if it involves large integers.  The TODO comment suggests that the code may be modified in the future, so it is essential to review the changes for any potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8,
