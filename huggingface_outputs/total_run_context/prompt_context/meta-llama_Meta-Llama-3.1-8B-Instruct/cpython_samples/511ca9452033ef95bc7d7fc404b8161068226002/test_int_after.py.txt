 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. This vulnerability is related to the parsing of large integers in Python. The code snippet provided is attempting to parse a large integer with 7 digits in base 32, which is within the allowed limit. However, the test suite is designed to test the limits of the integer parsing, and it includes tests for parsing large integers in various bases, including base 32. The vulnerability is related to the parsing of integers with quadratic time complexity, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit the size of the input integers to prevent DoS attacks.
2. Use a more efficient algorithm for parsing large integers.
3. Consider using a library that provides a more robust and secure way of parsing integers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,
