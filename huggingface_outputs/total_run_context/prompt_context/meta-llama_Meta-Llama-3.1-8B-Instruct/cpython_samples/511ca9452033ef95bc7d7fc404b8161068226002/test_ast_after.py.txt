 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. The vulnerability is present in the test_literal_eval_str_int_limit function where the ast.literal_eval function is called with a string that exceeds the maximum allowed digits. This is evident in the line where ast.literal_eval is called with '3'*4001. The error message indicates that the input exceeds the limit and suggests considering hexadecimal representation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit the input string to the maximum allowed digits.
2. Consider using a more robust parsing library that can handle large input strings.
3. If possible, use a hexadecimal representation for large integers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are
