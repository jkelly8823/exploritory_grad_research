 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735. The code is testing the ast.literal_eval function with various inputs, including strings that would raise a ValueError, and complex numbers. The function is being used correctly and is not being used with large strings that could cause a performance issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to address this vulnerability.  The ast.literal_eval function is being used correctly and is not being used in a way that would be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735.  However, it's worth noting that the function is not intended to be used with arbitrary strings, and should only be used with strings that are known to be safe.  In this case, the strings being passed to the function are all known to be safe, and the function is being used correctly.  Therefore, no changes are necessary.  If the function were being used with arbitrary user input, additional validation and sanitization would be necessary to prevent this vulnerability.  But in this case, the code is secure.  The code is secure.  The code is
