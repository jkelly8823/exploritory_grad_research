 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a series of assertions to verify the properties of various system attributes and constants. It checks the types and values of attributes such as sys.executable, sys.float_info, sys.int_info, sys.hash_info, and sys.flags. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2020-10735, which is related to a flaw in the int() function for non-binary bases. The code is simply testing the properties of system attributes and does not involve any parsing of large integers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date and follow best practices for coding and testing. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal,
