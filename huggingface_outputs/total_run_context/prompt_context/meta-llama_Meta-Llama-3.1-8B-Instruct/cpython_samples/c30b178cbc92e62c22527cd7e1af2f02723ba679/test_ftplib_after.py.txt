EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. In the `collect_incoming_data` method, the `offset` variable is calculated by parsing the `rest` attribute, which is an integer. However, if the `rest` attribute is not an integer, the `offset` variable will be set to 0, which can lead to a buffer overflow when pushing data to `self.dtp`. Additionally, in the `cmd_setlongretr` method, the `next_retr_data` attribute is set to a string of 'x' characters repeated `int(arg)` times, which can also lead to a buffer overflow when pushing data to `self.dtp`. Furthermore, in the `cmd_list` method, the `MLSD_DATA` attribute is pushed to `self.dtp` without any checks, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that `self.rest` is an integer before calculating the `offset` variable in the `collect_incoming_data` method.
2. Add a check to ensure that `int(arg)` is within a safe range before setting `self
