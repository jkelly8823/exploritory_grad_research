EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The getline() method reads a line from the server, but it does not check if the line is too long before passing it to the readline() method. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the server sends a line that is longer than the maxline parameter. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where the server sends a line that ends with a CRLF but has more bytes after the CRLF. This could also lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the line before passing it to the readline() method to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Properly handle the case where the server sends a line that ends with a CRLF but has more bytes after the CRLF.
3. Consider using a more secure method to read lines from the server, such as using a library that handles buffer overflows for you. 
4. Consider adding error handling to
