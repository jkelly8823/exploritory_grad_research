 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. In the `collect_incoming_data` method, the `offset` variable is calculated as `int(self.rest)`, which can lead to an integer overflow if `self.rest` is a large number. This can cause the `offset` variable to be set to a value greater than the length of the `self.next_retr_data` string, resulting in a buffer overflow when slicing the string.
Additionally, in the `cmd_setlongretr` method, the `self.next_retr_data` attribute is set to a string of 'x' characters repeated `int(arg)` times. If `arg` is a large number, this can cause a memory leak or even a crash.
The `DummyFTPServer` class is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack in the `test_line_too_long` method, where a command string of length `self.client.maxline * 2` is sent to the server. This can cause a buffer overflow when parsing the command.
The `test_retrlines_too_long` and `test_storlines_too_long` methods
