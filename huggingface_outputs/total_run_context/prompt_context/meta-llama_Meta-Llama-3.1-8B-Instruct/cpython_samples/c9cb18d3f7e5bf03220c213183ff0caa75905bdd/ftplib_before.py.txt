EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation and error handling. The `getline` method does not properly handle cases where the server returns an empty line, which can cause the program to enter an infinite loop. Additionally, the code does not check for invalid responses from the server, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation to ensure that the server's responses are properly formatted and do not contain any malicious data.
2. Add error handling to properly handle cases where the server returns an empty line or an invalid response.
3. Consider using a more robust library or framework for handling FTP connections, as the current implementation appears to be custom and may be prone to errors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Lack of input validation
2. Inadequate error handling
3. Potential DoS attack due to infinite loop
4. Unhandled exceptions
