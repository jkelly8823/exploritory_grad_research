VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The `getline` method reads a line from the server, but it does not properly handle the case where the server sends a line that is longer than the specified maximum length (`MAXLINE`). This can cause the `line` variable to overflow and potentially lead to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to read lines from the server, such as using a library that provides a secure way to read lines.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the length of the line read from the server does not exceed the maximum length.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle the `debugging` variable, such as using a logging library instead of printing to the console. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
1. Buffer Overflow Attack
2. Insecure Debugging
3. Potential Data Exposure due to Insecure File Handling.
