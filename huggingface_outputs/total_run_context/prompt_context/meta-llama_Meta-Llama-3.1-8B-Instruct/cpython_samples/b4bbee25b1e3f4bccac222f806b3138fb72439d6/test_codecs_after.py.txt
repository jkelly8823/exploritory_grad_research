 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 28-30
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-2135 due to the use of the `codecs.utf_16_le_decode` and `codecs.utf_16_be_decode` functions in the `test_errors` and `test_nonbmp` methods. These functions are affected by the vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Python version to 3.4 or later, which fixes the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure alternative to the `codecs.utf_16_le_decode` and `codecs.utf_16_be_decode` functions, such as the `unicodedata` module.
3. Implement additional error handling and validation to prevent potential attacks.
