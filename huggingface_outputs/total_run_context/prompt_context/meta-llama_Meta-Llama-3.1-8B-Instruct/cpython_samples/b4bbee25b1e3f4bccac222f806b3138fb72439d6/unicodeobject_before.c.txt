 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-2135 because it does not update the aligned_end variable after calling the unicode_decode_call_errorhandler function. This allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the aligned_end variable after calling unicode_decode_call_errorhandler.
2. Use a secure method to handle the remaining input chars when the callback chooses to skip the input.
