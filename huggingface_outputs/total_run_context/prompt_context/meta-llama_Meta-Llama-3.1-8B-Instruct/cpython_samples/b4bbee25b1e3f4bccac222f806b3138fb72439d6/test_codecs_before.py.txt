 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11, 20-21
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2135 vulnerability because it uses the utf-16 decoder in Python 3.1 through 3.3. The decoder does not update the aligned_end variable after calling the unicode_decode_call_errorhandler function, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (process memory) or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) via unspecified vectors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to Python 3.4 or later, which fixes this vulnerability.
2. Use a secure decoder, such as the one provided by the `chardet` library.
3. Implement a custom decoder that updates the aligned_end variable correctly. 
4. Use a secure encoding, such as UTF-8, which is less vulnerable to decoder errors. 
5. Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being passed to the decoder. 
6. Use a secure library, such as `cryptography`, to handle sensitive data. 
7. Regularly update and patch your Python installation to ensure you have the latest security fixes. 
8. Use a secure coding practice, such as input
