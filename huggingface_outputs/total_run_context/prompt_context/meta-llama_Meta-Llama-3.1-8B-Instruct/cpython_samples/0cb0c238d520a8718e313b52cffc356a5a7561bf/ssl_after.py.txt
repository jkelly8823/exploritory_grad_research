EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-40217 issue. This vulnerability occurs when a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly. In this case, the code attempts to handle the situation where the socket is not connected by performing a non-blocking recv operation. However, this can lead to a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the socket is not closed before the TLS handshake is completed.
2. Consider using a more robust way to handle the situation where the socket is not connected, such as using a try-except block to catch the ENOTCONN error.
3. Ensure that the socket timeout is set correctly to prevent the socket from being closed prematurely. 
4. Consider adding a log statement to track the situation where the socket is closed before the TLS handshake is completed. This can help with
