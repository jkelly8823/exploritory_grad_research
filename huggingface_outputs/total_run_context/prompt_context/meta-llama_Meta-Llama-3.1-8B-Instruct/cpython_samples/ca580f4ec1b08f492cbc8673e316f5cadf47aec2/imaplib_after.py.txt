 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The readline() function reads a line from the remote server, but it does not check if the line is null-terminated. This allows an attacker to send a line that is longer than _MAXLINE, causing the function to read beyond the end of the buffer and potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Modify the readline() function to check if the line is null-terminated before reading it. This can be done by checking if the last character of the line is a null character (\x00).
2. Consider using a safer method of reading lines from the remote server, such as using a library that provides a secure way to read lines.
3. Increase the value of _MAXLINE to a larger value, such as 65536, to reduce the likelihood of a buffer overflow attack. However, this should be done with caution, as it may increase the risk of other types of attacks.
