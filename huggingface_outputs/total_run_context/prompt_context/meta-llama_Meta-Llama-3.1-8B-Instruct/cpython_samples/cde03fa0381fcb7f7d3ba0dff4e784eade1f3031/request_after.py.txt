 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-1000110 vulnerability. The issue arises when the code attempts to remove the 'http' proxy from the environment variables. However, it does not account for the case where the 'http_proxy' variable is set by the web server via a "Proxy:" header from the client. This can lead to the removal of the intended proxy setting, causing HTTP requests to be redirected to an unintended location.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the case of the 'http_proxy' variable before removing it from the environment variables.
2. Use the 'get' method to retrieve the 'http_proxy' variable from the environment variables, which will return None if the variable is not set, preventing the removal of the intended proxy setting. 
3. Consider using a more robust method to handle environment variables, such as using a library like 'python-dotenv' to load environment variables from a file. This can help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```python
if 'http_proxy' in os.environ and os.environ['http_proxy'].lower() == 'http_proxy':
    proxies.pop('http', None
