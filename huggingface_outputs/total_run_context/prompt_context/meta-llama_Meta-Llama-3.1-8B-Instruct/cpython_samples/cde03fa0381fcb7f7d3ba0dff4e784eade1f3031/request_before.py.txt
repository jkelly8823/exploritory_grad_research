 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash. The code checks for the presence of the '_proxy' suffix in the environment variable name and then attempts to remove it. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the variable name clash. An attacker could still exploit this vulnerability by using a variable name that is a substring of the '_proxy' suffix, such as 'HTTP_PROXY_123'. The code should be modified to check for the exact match of the '_proxy' suffix instead of a substring match.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Modify the code to check for the exact match of the '_proxy' suffix using the 'endswith' method instead of the '==' operator. For example: if name.lower().endswith('_proxy'):
2. Remove the line that removes the '_proxy' suffix from the variable name, as it is not necessary and could potentially introduce new vulnerabilities. For example: name = name.lower()
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle environment variables, such as using a whitelist of allowed variables or using a library that provides secure environment variable handling. For example: from secure_env import get_environment_variables; proxies
