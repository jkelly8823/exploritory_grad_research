 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-24329 because it removes unsafe bytes from the URL and scheme using the replace() method. This can be exploited by an attacker to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters. The issue is present in lines 7-8 where the replace() method is used to remove the unsafe bytes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the lstrip() method instead of replace() to remove leading whitespace characters from the URL and scheme.
2. Use the str.translate() method to remove the unsafe bytes from the URL and scheme. This method is more efficient and safer than using the replace() method. 
3. Consider using a more robust URL parsing library that can handle edge cases and security vulnerabilities. 
4. Update the Python version to 3.11.4 or later to fix the CVE-2023-24329 vulnerability.  ```python
def clear_cache():
    """

    url, scheme, _coerce_result = _coerce_args(url, scheme)

    url = url.lstrip(_UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE)
    scheme = scheme.lstrip(_UNSAFE
