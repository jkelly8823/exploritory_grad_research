 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-24329 due to the use of urllib.parse.urlsplit() with a URL that starts with blank characters. This allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Python to version 3.11.4 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Avoid using urllib.parse.urlsplit() with URLs that start with blank characters.
3. Use a more secure URL parsing library that does not have this vulnerability. 
4. Validate user input to prevent malicious URLs from being used. 
5. Consider using a library that provides more robust URL parsing and validation, such as `urllib.parse.urlparse()` with a custom scheme.
