 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-24329 because it does not properly handle URLs that start with blank characters. In the test_attributes_bad_port function, the url variable is constructed by concatenating the scheme and the netloc. However, the netloc is not validated for blank characters at the start. This allows an attacker to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the netloc for blank characters at the start before constructing the URL.
2. Use the urllib.parse.urlparse function to properly parse the URL and handle any potential vulnerabilities. 
3. Consider using a more robust URL validation library to handle complex URL cases.  ```python
