 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-24329 because it does not properly handle URLs that start with blank characters. The line `url = url.lstrip(_WHATWG_C0_CONTROL_OR_SPACE)` only removes leading C0 control and space characters, but does not remove blank characters. This allows an attacker to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle URLs that start with blank characters by removing them using the `replace()` method.
2. Consider using a more robust URL parsing library that handles edge cases like this one. 
3. Test the updated code to ensure it handles URLs with blank characters correctly.
