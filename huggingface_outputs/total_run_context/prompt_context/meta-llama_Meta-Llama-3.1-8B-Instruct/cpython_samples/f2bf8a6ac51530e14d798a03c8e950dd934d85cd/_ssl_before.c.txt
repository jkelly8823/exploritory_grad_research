 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of SSL_OP_ALL, which enables SSLv3. The BEAST attack exploits the CBC mode used in SSLv3, allowing an attacker to obtain plaintext HTTP headers. This vulnerability is present in the line where SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL) is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the SSL library to a version that is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack, such as OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later.
2. Disable SSLv3 by removing SSL_OP_ALL and only enabling the necessary options.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0160
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL library before 1.0.1g does not properly protect against timing side-channel attacks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a given number is a valid RSA key or not via a timing side-channel attack, aka the "heartbleed bug."

Code Sample:
