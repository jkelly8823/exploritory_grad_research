 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks. This is because the code does not properly validate the host component of a URL. In the test_putrequest_override_host_validation method, the host is set to a string that includes a CRLF character. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious headers into the request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the host component of the URL to prevent CRLF injection attacks.
2. Use a secure method to set the host component of the URL, such as using a library that properly escapes special characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle HTTP requests, such as using a library that is designed to handle HTTP requests securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18348
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed
