 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection due to the use of urllib.request.urlopen with a URL that contains a \r\n sequence in the host component. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-18348) that can be exploited by an attacker who controls a URL parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure URL parsing library that can handle CRLF sequences correctly.
- Validate user input to prevent CRLF injection attacks.
- Upgrade to a version of Python that has the CVE-2019-18348 fix applied. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18348
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string issue
