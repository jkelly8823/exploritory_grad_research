 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks. This is because the code does not properly sanitize the input URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious headers. The issue is present in the putheader method where it does not check for CRLF characters in the header.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a library that properly sanitizes the input URL, such as the `urllib.parse` module.
2. Implement a custom function to sanitize the input URL and remove any CRLF characters.
3. Use a secure method to send the request, such as using the `requests` library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18348
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the
