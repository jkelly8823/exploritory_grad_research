 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks. This is because the code does not properly sanitize user input when constructing URLs. In the test_url_with_newline_header_injection_rejected method, the host variable is constructed by concatenating a user-controlled string with a newline character, which can be used to inject malicious HTTP headers. This is a classic example of a CRLF injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a library like urllib.parse to properly sanitize user input when constructing URLs.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and only allow specific characters.
3. Consider using a more secure way to construct URLs, such as using a URL template engine. 
4. Update the code to use the latest version of the ssl module, which includes fixes for this vulnerability. 
5. Consider using a more secure way to handle HTTP requests, such as using a library like requests. 6. Use a linter to catch potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 7. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 8. Use a secure coding practice to handle user input. 9. Consider
