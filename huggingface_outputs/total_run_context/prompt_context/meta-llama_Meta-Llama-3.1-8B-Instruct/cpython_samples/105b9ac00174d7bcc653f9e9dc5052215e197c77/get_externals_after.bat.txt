 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that uses the bzip2 library, which is the library associated with the two vulnerabilities listed. The code sample is a batch script that sets environment variables for external libraries, but it does not include any code that would be vulnerable to the use-after-free or out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the external libraries being used are up-to-date and patched against any known vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities that may be introduced by the use of these external libraries.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
