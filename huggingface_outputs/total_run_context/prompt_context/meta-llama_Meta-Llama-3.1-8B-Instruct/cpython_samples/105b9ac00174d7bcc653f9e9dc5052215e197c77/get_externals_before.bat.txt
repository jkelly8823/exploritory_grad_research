 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any direct references to the bzip2 library, which is the primary target of the two vulnerabilities listed. The code does, however, reference other libraries that may be vulnerable to other types of attacks. However, based on the provided information, there is no indication that the bzip2 library is being used in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider using a more secure library or version of the bzip2 library if it is being used in this code. Additionally, ensure that all external libraries are properly vetted and updated to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  Consider using a dependency manager to automate the process of updating and managing dependencies.  Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  Consider using a code review process to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  Consider using a secure coding practices guide to ensure that the code is written securely.  Consider using a secure coding training program to educate developers on secure coding practices.  Consider using a secure coding policy to ensure that all code is written securely.  Consider using a secure coding checklist to ensure that all code is written securely.  Consider using a secure coding framework
