 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-0845 because it does not properly handle partial POST requests. The test_partial_post method sends a POST request with a Content-Length header that specifies a larger amount of data than is actually sent in the request body. This can cause the server to enter an infinite loop and consume excessive CPU resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the Content-Length header against the actual request body length to prevent partial POST requests from causing an infinite loop.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the amount of data that can be sent in a POST request to prevent excessive CPU consumption. 
3. Consider using a more robust and secure way to handle POST requests, such as using a library that properly handles chunked encoding.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
