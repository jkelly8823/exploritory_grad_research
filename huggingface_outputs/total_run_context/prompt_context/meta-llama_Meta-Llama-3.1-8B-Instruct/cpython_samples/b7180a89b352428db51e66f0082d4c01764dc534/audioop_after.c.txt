 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) due to the lack of verification of the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1634.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths to prevent memory corruption and application crashes.
2. Implement checks to ensure that the size arguments are within the valid range (1, 2, or 4) to prevent memory corruption and application crashes.
3. Use a secure method to handle memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory corruption and application crashes.
4. Implement a mechanism to detect and handle invalid input to prevent memory corruption and application crashes. 
5. Consider using a secure coding practice such as bounds checking to prevent memory corruption and application crashes. 
6. Consider using a secure coding practice such as input validation to prevent memory corruption and application crashes. 
7. Consider using a secure coding practice such as error handling to prevent memory corruption and application crashes. 
8. Consider using a secure coding practice such as secure coding guidelines to prevent memory corruption and application crashes. 
9. Consider using
