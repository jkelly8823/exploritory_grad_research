 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to the lack of proper entity expansion handling. The XML parser does not use the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function to properly handle entities expansion.
2. Validate user-supplied XML input to prevent XXE attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure XML parser library that handles XXE attacks by default. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0340
CVE Description:
expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable
