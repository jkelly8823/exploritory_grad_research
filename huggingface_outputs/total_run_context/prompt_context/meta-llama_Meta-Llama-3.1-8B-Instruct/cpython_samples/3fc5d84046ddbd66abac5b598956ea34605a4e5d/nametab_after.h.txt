 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-0340 XML External Entity (XXE) issue. This is because the XML parser is not configured to disable external entity expansion, which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code that can lead to a denial of service, send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the XML parser to a version that is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-0340 issue.
2. Configure the XML parser to disable external entity expansion using the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function.
3. Validate user-input XML data to prevent malicious code from being injected. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0340
CVE Description:
expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be
