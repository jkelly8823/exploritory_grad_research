 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XXE (XML External Entity) attacks due to the inclusion of the expat library, which is known to have this vulnerability. Although the code does not explicitly use the XML parsing functionality, the inclusion of the library itself is enough to make the code vulnerable. This is because an attacker could potentially craft a malicious XML document that exploits the vulnerability, even if the code does not directly use the XML parsing functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the inclusion of the expat library if it is not necessary for the code's functionality.
2. If the expat library is necessary, ensure that it is properly configured to prevent XXE attacks, such as by using the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the expat library, such as a library that is specifically designed to prevent XXE attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0340
CVE Description:
expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
