 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14/None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue due to the lack of proper handling of entities expansion. The XML parser does not use the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function to properly handle entities expansion.
2. Disable external entity expansion by setting the XML_DTD flag to 0.
3. Validate user-input XML documents to prevent XXE attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-0340
CVE Description:
expat 2.1.0 and earlier does not properly handle entities expansion unless an application developer uses the XML_SetEntityDeclHandler function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption), send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability
