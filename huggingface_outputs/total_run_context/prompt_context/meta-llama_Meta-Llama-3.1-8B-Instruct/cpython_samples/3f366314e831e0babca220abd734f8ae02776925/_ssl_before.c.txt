 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of SSLv3. The SSL_CTX_set_options function is used to set the SSL protocol options, and the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 option is not set, which means that SSLv3 is still enabled. This allows an attacker to exploit the BEAST attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 option to disable SSLv3.
2. Set the SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 option to disable TLSv1.
3. Use a more secure protocol such as TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3. 
4. Consider using a library that supports modern TLS protocols, such as OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. 
5. Consider using a secure protocol like DTLS. 
6. Consider using a secure library like mbed TLS. 
7. Consider using a secure library like wolfSSL. 
8. Consider using a secure library like BoringSSL. 
9. Consider using a secure library like LibreSSL. 
10. Consider using a secure library like OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later.
