 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is a known vulnerability in the SSL protocol, and it can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain plaintext HTTP headers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or later, which uses the AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphersuites that are resistant to the BEAST attack.
2. Use the SSL_OP_NO_BEAST option to disable the BEAST attack, but this may have compatibility issues with some clients.
3. Consider using a library that provides a secure SSL/TLS implementation, such as OpenSSL or wolfSSL. 
4. Disable SSLv2 and SSLv3, as they are outdated and insecure. 
5. Use a secure cipher suite, such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. 
6. Consider using a secure protocol, such as TLS 1.3, which is designed to be more secure than TLS 1.2. 7. Use a secure random number generator to generate session IDs
