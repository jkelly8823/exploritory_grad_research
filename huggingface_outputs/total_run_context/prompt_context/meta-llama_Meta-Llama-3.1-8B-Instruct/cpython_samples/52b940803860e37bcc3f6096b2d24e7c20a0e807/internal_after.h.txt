 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-15903 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to a buffer over-read in the XML parsing functionality of libexpat, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-15903 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that any external libraries or dependencies used in the project are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.  This vulnerability is not present in the code sample provided.  The code sample does not contain any XML parsing functionality.  The vulnerability is related to the libexpat library, which is not used in this code sample.  Therefore, the
