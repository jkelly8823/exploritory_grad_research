 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer over-read due to the use of XML_GetCurrentLineNumber and XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber after a crafted XML input has changed the parser from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. This is a known vulnerability in libexpat before 2.2.8.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update libexpat to version 2.2.8 or later.
2. Avoid using XML_GetCurrentLineNumber and XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber after parsing a crafted XML input.
3. Consider using a more secure XML parser library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE-2019-15903: In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.  This vulnerability is present in the code sample.  The fix is to update libexpat to version 2.2.8 or later.  The recommended fix is to update libexpat to version 2.2.8
