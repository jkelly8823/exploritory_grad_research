 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the vulnerability CVE-2019-15903. The vulnerability is related to a buffer over-read in the XML parser, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a header file that defines structures and macros for XML parsing, but it does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure XML parsing library to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities like this one.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

Code Sample:
int main() {
  XML_Parser parser = XML
