VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

Code Sample:
```c
enum {
  BT_NONXML,   /* e.g. noncharacter-FFFF */
  BT_MALFORM,  /* illegal, with regard to encoding */
  BT_LT,       /* less than = "<" */
  BT_AMP,      /* ampersand = "&" */
  BT_RSQB,     /* right square bracket = "[" */
  BT_LEAD2,    /* lead byte of a 2-byte UTF-8 character */
  BT_LEAD3,    /* lead byte of a 3-byte UTF-8 character */
  BT_LEAD4,    /* lead byte of a 4
