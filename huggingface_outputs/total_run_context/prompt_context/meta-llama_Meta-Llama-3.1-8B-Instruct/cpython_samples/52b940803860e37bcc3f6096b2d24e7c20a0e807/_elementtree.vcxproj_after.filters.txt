 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a snippet from a Visual Studio project file (.vcxproj). It includes XML elements to reference header files, but it does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-15903. The vulnerability is related to the libexpat library, which is used for parsing XML, and is not directly related to the project file syntax.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could introduce the vulnerability. However, if you are using the libexpat library in your project, ensure that you are using a version that is not vulnerable to this issue. Consider upgrading to a version that is at least 2.2.8 or later. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
