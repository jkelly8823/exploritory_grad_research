 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-15903 vulnerability. The code is a table of character codes and their corresponding bit values, which does not involve parsing XML or using the XML_GetCurrentLineNumber function. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions necessary for this vulnerability to occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this issue, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with external libraries or parsing user-input data.  ``` VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

Code Sample:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    char buffer[MAX_SIZE];
    char*
