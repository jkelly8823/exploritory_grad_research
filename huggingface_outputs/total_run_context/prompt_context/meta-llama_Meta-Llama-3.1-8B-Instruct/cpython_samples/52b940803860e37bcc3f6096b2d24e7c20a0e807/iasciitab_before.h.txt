 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a table of ASCII character codes and their corresponding names. It does not contain any XML parsing or processing, which makes it unlikely to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-15903 vulnerability. The code is a simple array of constants, and there is no indication of any dynamic XML parsing or manipulation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified vulnerability, and no changes are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with external libraries or parsing user-input data.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.  Code Sample: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <expat.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAXLEN 1024
