CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.  Code Sample:
    <ClCompile Include="..\Modules\pyexpat.c">
      <Filter>Source Files</Filter>
    </
