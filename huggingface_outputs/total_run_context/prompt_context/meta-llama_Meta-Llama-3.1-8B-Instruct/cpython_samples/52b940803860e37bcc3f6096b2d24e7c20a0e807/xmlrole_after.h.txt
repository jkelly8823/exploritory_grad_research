 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the vulnerable function XML_GetCurrentLineNumber or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber. However, the code does contain a function pointer handler which could potentially be used to access these functions indirectly. Without more context or information about the handler function, it is difficult to determine if this vulnerability is present.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the handler function to ensure it does not access XML_GetCurrentLineNumber or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber.
2. Consider adding input validation and sanitization to prevent potential buffer over-reads.
3. If the handler function is not necessary, consider removing it to simplify the code and reduce potential attack surfaces.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.  Code Sample:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SIZE
