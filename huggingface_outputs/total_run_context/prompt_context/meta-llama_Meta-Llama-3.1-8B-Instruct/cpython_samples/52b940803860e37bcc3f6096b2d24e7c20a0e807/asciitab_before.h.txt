 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a sequence of byte codes representing a character encoding. It does not contain any XML parsing code, and therefore is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-15903 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any XML parsing code, so no fixes are necessary. However, if this code is intended to parse XML, it should be reviewed and updated to use a secure XML parsing library.  The code should also be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15903
CVE Description:
In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.  This vulnerability is specific to XML parsing and does not apply to the provided code sample.  The code sample appears to be a sequence of byte codes representing a character encoding and does not contain any XML parsing code.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this CVE.
