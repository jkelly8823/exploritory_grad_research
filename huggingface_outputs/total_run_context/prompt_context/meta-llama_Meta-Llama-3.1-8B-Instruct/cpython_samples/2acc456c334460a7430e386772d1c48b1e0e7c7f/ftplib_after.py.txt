VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The `getline` method reads a line from the server, but it does not check if the line is null-terminated. This allows an attacker to send a line that is longer than the buffer size, causing a buffer overflow. Additionally, the `transfercmd` method is called without checking if the connection is established, which can lead to a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the line is null-terminated before reading it into the buffer.
2. Check if the connection is established before calling `transfercmd`.
3. Use a safer method to read lines from the server, such as using a library that handles buffer management for you. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

1. Buffer Overflow
	* Description: A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it is designed to hold. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly
