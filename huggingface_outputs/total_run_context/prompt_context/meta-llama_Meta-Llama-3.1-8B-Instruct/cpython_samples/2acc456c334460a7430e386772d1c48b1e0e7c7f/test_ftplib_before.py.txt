 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. In the collect_incoming_data method, the offset variable is calculated by parsing the rest variable as an integer. However, if the rest variable is not a valid integer, it will be set to 0, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow attack if the data being pushed to the dtp object is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the rest variable to ensure it is a valid integer before parsing it.
2. Sanitize the data being pushed to the dtp object to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
3. Consider using a safer method to calculate the offset, such as using the len function to get the length of the data being pushed.
