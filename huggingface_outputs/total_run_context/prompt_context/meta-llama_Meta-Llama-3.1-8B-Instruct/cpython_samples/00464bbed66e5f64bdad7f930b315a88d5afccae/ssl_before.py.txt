```python
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-295 because it does not validate the certificate correctly. The `cert_reqs` parameter is set to `CERT_NONE` by default, which means that the certificate is not verified at all. This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker can intercept the communication and present a fake certificate to the client.

Additionally, the `verify_mode` attribute of the `SSLContext` object is set to `cert_reqs`, which is not a valid value. The `verify_mode` attribute should be set to one of the following values: `SSLVerifyMode.CERT_REQUIRED`, `SSLVerifyMode.CERT_OPTIONAL`, or `SSLVerifyMode.CERT_NONE`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the `cert_reqs` parameter to `CERT_REQUIRED` to ensure that the certificate is verified.
2. Set the `verify_mode` attribute of the `SSLContext`
