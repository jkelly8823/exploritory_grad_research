VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that handles SSL certificates or certificate validation. The provided code snippet only sets the SSL object class and defines a utility function to convert certificate time to seconds. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for CWE-295.
