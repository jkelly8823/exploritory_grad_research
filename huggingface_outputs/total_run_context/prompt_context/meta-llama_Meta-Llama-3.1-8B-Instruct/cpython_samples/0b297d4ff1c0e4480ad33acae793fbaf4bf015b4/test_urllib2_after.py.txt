 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of the `urllib.request.HTTPBasicAuthHandler` class. This class is known to be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause the system to consume excessive resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Python that is not vulnerable to this issue, such as Python 3.9 or later.
2. Use a third-party library that is not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, such as `requests`.
3. Implement a custom authentication handler that is not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. 
4. Use a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT. 
5. Consider using a WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect against ReDoS attacks. 
6. Regularly update and patch your system to ensure that you have the latest security fixes. 
7. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a linter or a code analyzer, to detect potential security vulnerabilities in your code. 
8. Consider using a secure coding framework, such as OWASP
