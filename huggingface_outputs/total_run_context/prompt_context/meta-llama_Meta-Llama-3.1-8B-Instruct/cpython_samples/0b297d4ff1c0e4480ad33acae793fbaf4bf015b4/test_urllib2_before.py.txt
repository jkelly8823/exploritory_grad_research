 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to the use of the `urllib.request.HTTPBasicAuthHandler` class. This class is known to be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is present in the `test_basic_auth` method, where the `HTTPBasicAuthHandler` class is used to handle basic authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a newer version of Python that is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. Use a different library or implementation that is not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
3. Implement a custom authentication handler that is not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
4. Use a library that provides protection against ReDoS attacks, such as the `regex` library.
