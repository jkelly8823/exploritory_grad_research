 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack. The variable 'foo' is being used directly in the'retr' method without any sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code if 'foo' is a user-controlled input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input 'foo' before passing it to the'retr' method.
2. Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input 'foo' to ensure it only contains expected characters.
