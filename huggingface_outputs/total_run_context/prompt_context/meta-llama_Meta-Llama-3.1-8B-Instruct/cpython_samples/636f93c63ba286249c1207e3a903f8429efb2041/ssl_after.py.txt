 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain the suspected vulnerability. The code is designed to handle DNS names and prevent denial of service by refusing more than one wildcard per fragment. It raises a CertificateError when it encounters a DNS name with too many wildcards. This is a proactive measure to prevent the algorithmic complexity vulnerability mentioned in the CVE description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain the suspected vulnerability. However, it's worth noting that the code is designed to handle a specific case and may not cover all possible scenarios. It's always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements and security standards.  ```python
