 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2099 vulnerability because it uses the ssl.match_hostname function with a dictionary and None as the first argument, which can lead to a denial of service (CPU consumption) via multiple wildcard characters in the common name in a certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the ssl.match_hostname function with a dictionary or None as the first argument.
2. Use a more secure method to handle hostname matching, such as using a regular expression or a dedicated hostname matching library.
3. Consider upgrading to a version of Python that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as Python 3.4 or later. 
4. If upgrading is not possible, consider using a workaround such as using a custom hostname matching function that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```python
def custom_match_hostname(hostname, server_hostname):
    # implement custom hostname matching logic here
    pass
```  ```python
```python
