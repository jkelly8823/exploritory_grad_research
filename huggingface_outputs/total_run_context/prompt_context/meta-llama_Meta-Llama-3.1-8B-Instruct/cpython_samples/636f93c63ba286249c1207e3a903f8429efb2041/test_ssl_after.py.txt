 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2099 vulnerability. This is because the code is testing the ssl.match_hostname function with a certificate that has multiple wildcards in the common name. The function is designed to prevent this type of attack by raising a CertificateError when it encounters more than one wildcard. However, the code is testing this behavior and is therefore vulnerable to the same type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the lines of code that are testing the ssl.match_hostname function with a certificate that has multiple wildcards in the common name.
2. Use a different approach to test the ssl.match_hostname function that does not involve creating a certificate with multiple wildcards.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling SSL certificates, such as using a library that is designed to handle SSL certificates securely. 4. Consider using a more secure approach to testing the ssl.match_hostname function, such as using a mock certificate or a test certificate that is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2099 vulnerability. 5. Consider using a more secure approach to handling SSL certificates, such as using a library that is designed to handle
