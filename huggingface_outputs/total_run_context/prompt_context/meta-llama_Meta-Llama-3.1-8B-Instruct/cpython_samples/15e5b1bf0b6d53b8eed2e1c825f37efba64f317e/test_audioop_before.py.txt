 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2010-2089 because it does not verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths. The test_max function in the TestAudioop class calls audioop.findmax with a string of 256 characters and an invalid size argument (-2392392), which can cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths before passing them to audioop functions.
2. Use a safe and valid size argument when calling audioop functions.
3. Consider using a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur when calling audioop functions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2010-2089
CVE Description:
The audioop module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via crafted arguments, as demonstrated by a call to audioop.reverse with a one-byte string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1634
