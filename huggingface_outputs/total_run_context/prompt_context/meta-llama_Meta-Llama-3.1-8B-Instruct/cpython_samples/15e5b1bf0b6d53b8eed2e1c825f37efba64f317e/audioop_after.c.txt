 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) due to the lack of verification of the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths. This is a direct match for the CVE-2010-2089 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the size argument against the length of the byte string to prevent memory corruption.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the size argument is within the valid range (1, 2, or 4).
3. Consider using a more robust data type, such as a struct or a class, to represent the audio data and its associated metadata. This would help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 
4. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and address them accordingly. 
5. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 
6. Implement a testing framework to thoroughly test the code and identify any potential issues. 
7. Consider using a code review process to ensure that the code is reviewed and validated by multiple developers before it is deployed. 
8. Consider using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing
