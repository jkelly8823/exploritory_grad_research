 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-1000110 vulnerability. The issue arises when the code checks for the 'REQUEST_METHOD' environment variable and removes the 'http_proxy' key from the proxies dictionary. However, it does not account for the case where the 'http_proxy' key is set with a non-all-lowercase name, such as 'HTTP_PROXY'. This allows an attacker to redirect HTTP requests by setting the 'HTTP_PROXY' variable in the web server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle the case where the 'http_proxy' key is set with a non-all-lowercase name. This can be achieved by converting the key to lowercase before checking if it matches 'http_proxy'. The modified code should look like this:
```
if 'REQUEST_METHOD' in os.environ:
    proxies.pop('http', None)
for name, value in os.environ.items():
    if name.lower()[-6:] == '_proxy':
        if value:
            proxies[name.lower()[:-6]] = value
