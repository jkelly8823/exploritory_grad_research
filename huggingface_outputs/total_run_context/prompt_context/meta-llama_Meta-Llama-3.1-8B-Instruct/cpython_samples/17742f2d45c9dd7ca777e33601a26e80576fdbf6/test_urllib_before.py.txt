 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash in a CGI script. The test cases are testing the proxy_bypass_environment function with specific domain names, but the function is not properly configured to protect against the variable name clash. This is a known vulnerability in Python before 2.7.12.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Python to version 2.7.12 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure proxy configuration that does not rely on the HTTP_PROXY variable.
3. Consider using a more secure library for handling HTTP requests, such as requests.  ```python
import requests

# Use the requests library to make HTTP requests
response = requests.get('http://example.com')
```  ```python
```python
