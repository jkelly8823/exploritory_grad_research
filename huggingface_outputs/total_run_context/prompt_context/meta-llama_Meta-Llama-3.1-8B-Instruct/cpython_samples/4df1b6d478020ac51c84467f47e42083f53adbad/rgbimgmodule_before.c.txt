 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow due to the calculation of `rlebuflen`. The value of `xsize` is cast to an integer and then multiplied by 1.05, which can result in an integer overflow if `xsize` is large enough. This can cause the `rlebuflen` variable to be set to an incorrect value, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the calculation of `rlebuflen` should be changed to use a larger data type, such as `long long`, to prevent integer overflow. Additionally, the value of `xsize` should be checked to ensure it is not too large before performing the multiplication. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
rlebuflen = (long long) (1.05 * xsize + 10);
if (rlebuflen < 0) {
    // handle error
}
