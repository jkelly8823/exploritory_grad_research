 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code snippet is a test case for the pydoc module, and it does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to access sensitive information. The test case is designed to test the pydoc module's behavior, and it does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be fixed. However, it is worth noting that the code is a test case, and it is intended to test the pydoc module's behavior. As such, it may not be representative of real-world code that could be vulnerable to this CVE. If you are writing code that uses the pydoc module, you should ensure that you are using a version of Python that is not vulnerable to this CVE (i.e., Python 3.8.9 or later, Python 3.9.3 or later, or Python 3.10.0a7 or later).
