 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a pydoc server vulnerability. This is because the code is using Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7. The pydoc server is a feature in Python that allows users to access documentation for modules and objects. However, if an attacker can convince another user to start a pydoc server, they may be able to access sensitive information belonging to the other user.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to Python 3.8.9 or later.
2. Upgrade to Python 3.9.3 or later.
3. Upgrade to Python 3.10.0a7 or later.
4. Disable the pydoc server feature if it is not needed.
5. Implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
