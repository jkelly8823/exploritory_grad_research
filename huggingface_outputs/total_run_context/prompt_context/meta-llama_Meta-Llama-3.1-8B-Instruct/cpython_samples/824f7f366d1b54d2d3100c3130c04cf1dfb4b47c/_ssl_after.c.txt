 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly handle NULL bytes in ASN1_string. This is evident in the lines 34-35 where it is mentioned that GENERAL_NAME_print() doesn't handle NULL bytes in ASN1_string correctly, CVE-2013-4238. This is a known vulnerability in the OpenSSL library.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of OpenSSL that has this vulnerability fixed.
2. Use a secure alternative to GENERAL_NAME_print() that can handle NULL bytes in ASN1_string.
3. Implement a custom function to handle NULL bytes in ASN1_string. 
4. Use a library that is not vulnerable to this issue, such as a library that uses a different approach to handle NULL bytes in ASN1_string. 5. If none of the above options are feasible, consider using a different library or framework that does not use OpenSSL. 6. If the above options are not feasible, consider using a different programming language that is not vulnerable to this issue. 7. If the above options are not feasible, consider using a different approach to handle NULL bytes in ASN1
