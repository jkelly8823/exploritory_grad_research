 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the ssl.match_hostname function or the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. The code appears to be handling general names in a certificate, but it does not seem to be vulnerable to the specific issue described in CVE-2013-4238.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure. Consider adding additional checks or validation for certificate names to further mitigate potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4238
CVE Description:
The ssl.match_hostname function in the SSL module in Python 2.6 through 3.4 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.  Code Sample:
import ssl
import socket
