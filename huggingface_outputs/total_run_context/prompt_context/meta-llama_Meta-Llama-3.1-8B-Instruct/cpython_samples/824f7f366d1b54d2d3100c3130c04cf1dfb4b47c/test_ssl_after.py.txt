 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is evident in the test_parse_cert_CVE_2013_4238 method where a certificate with a null byte in the commonName field is created and parsed without any issues. The code also fails to handle null bytes in the subjectAltName field, which is another indicator of this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the ssl.match_hostname function to properly handle null bytes in domain names.
2. Add input validation to ensure that null bytes are not present in the subjectAltName field.
3. Consider using a more robust library for parsing X.509 certificates, such as OpenSSL. 
4. Test the updated code with a variety of certificates, including those with null bytes in the subjectAltName field. 5. Consider adding a warning or error message when a null byte is encountered in the subjectAltName field. 6. Review the code to ensure that it is handling null bytes correctly in all cases. 7. Consider adding
