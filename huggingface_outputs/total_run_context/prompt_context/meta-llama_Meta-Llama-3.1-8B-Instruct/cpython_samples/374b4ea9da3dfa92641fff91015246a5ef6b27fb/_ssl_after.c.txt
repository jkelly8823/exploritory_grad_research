 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS being disabled. This option is used to prevent the BEAST attack, which is a type of man-in-the-middle attack that can be used to obtain plaintext HTTP headers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Enable SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS by changing the line to SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL | SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS);. This will prevent the BEAST attack. Additionally, consider using TLS 1.2 or higher, which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack.

CVE_ID:CVE-2011-3389
CVE Description: The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5
