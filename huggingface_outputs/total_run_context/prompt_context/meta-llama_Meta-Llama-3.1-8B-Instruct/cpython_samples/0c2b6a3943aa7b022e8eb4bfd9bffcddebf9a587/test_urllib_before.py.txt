 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9948 vulnerability. This is because the code uses urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve(url) which supports the local_file: scheme. This allows an attacker to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to Python 3.x which does not support the local_file: scheme.
2. If upgrading is not possible, use a different library that does not support the local_file: scheme, such as requests.
3. If using urllib, use urllib.parse.urlparse(url) to check if the URL is a local file before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking if the URL starts with 'file://'. If it does, do not attempt to retrieve it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9948
CVE Description:
urllib in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.
