 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9948 because it uses urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve(url) which supports the local_file: scheme. This allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Python to version 2.7.17 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure alternative to urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve(url), such as requests library.
3. Remove the commented out code as it may still be vulnerable to the issue.
