 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not directly use urllib, but it does create a variable name based on the urltype. However, the variable name is then checked against a list of existing attributes, and if it does not exist, it falls back to a different method. This prevents the creation of a variable that could potentially be used to bypass protection mechanisms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure in this regard. However, it would be beneficial to add a check to ensure that the urltype is not a string that could be used to create a malicious variable name. This could be done by whitelisting the allowed urltypes.  The code could also be improved by using a more secure method of handling unknown urltypes, such as raising an exception instead of falling back to a different method.  This would prevent potential vulnerabilities in the fallback method.  Additionally, the code could be improved by adding a check to ensure that the fullurl is not a local file path.  This would prevent the potential vulnerability of bypassing protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs.  However, this would require additional logic to handle the case where the fullurl is a local file path
