 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any direct references to the urllib module or its usage. However, it does contain a function call to open_unknown_proxy or open_unknown which might be using urllib internally. Without the implementation of these functions, it's difficult to determine if the urllib module is being used in a way that would trigger the vulnerability. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the implementation of open_unknown_proxy and open_unknown functions to ensure they are not using urllib in a way that would trigger the vulnerability.
2. Consider using a more secure alternative to urllib, such as the requests library, for making HTTP requests. 
3. If the functions open_unknown_proxy and open_unknown are not using urllib, consider adding a comment to clarify their purpose and functionality.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9948 CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9948  CVE Description: urllib in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd
