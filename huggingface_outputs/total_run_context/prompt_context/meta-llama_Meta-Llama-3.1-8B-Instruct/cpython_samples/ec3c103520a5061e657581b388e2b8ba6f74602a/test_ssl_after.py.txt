 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is evident in the test_parse_cert_CVE_2013_4073 function where the 'commonName' field contains a '\0' character. The code also fails to handle the '\0' character in the'subjectAltName' field.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the ssl.match_hostname function to properly handle '\0' characters in domain names.
2. Use a secure method to handle X.509 certificates, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.
3. Test the code with a variety of X.509 certificates to ensure that it can handle different scenarios.
