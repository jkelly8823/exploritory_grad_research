 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it uses the ssl.match_hostname function which does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is evident in the line where the'subjectAltName' is being checked for 'linuxfr.org' which is a potential match for the '\0' character.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the ssl module to a version that properly handles the '\0' character in the domain name.
2. Use a custom function to handle the hostname matching instead of relying on the ssl.match_hostname function.
3. Validate the input data to ensure it does not contain any '\0' characters before passing it to the ssl.match_hostname function. 4. Consider using a more secure method of hostname matching, such as using a library that properly handles the '\0' character. 5. If possible, use a secure certificate that does not contain the '\0' character in the Subject Alternative Name field. 6. Consider using a secure method of certificate validation, such as using a library that properly handles the '\0' character.
