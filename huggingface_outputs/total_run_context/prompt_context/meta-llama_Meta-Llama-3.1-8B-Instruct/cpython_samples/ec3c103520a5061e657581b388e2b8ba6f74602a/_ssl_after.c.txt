 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is evident in lines 34-36 where the code attempts to handle GENERAL_NAME_print() not handling NUL bytes in ASN1_string correctly. The code attempts to handle this by creating a new tuple with the correct type and value, but this is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to handle NUL bytes in ASN1_string, such as using a library that is designed to handle this type of data.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle the Subject Alternative Name field, such as using a library that is designed to handle X.509 certificates.
3. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling all possible types of general names, including those that may contain NUL bytes.  ``` VULNERABLE: YES VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36 EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly
