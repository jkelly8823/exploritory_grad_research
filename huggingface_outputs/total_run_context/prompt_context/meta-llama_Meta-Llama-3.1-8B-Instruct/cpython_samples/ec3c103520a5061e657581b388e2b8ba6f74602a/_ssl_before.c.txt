 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability is present in lines 24-26 where the code attempts to handle the GENERAL_NAME_print function which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the domain name contains a '\0' character.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function to handle the GENERAL_NAME_print function, such as using a fixed-size buffer and checking for the presence of a '\0' character before printing.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle the Subject Alternative Name field, such as using a library that properly handles '\0' characters in domain names. 
3. Ensure that the code properly checks for and handles any potential buffer overflows when printing the domain name. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to handle the GENERAL_NAME_print function, such as using a function that does not use a buffer at all. 
5. Use a secure method to handle the BIO_reset function, such as checking the return value to ensure that the reset was successful
