VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash in a CGI script. This is because the code does not check if the 'name' variable is equal to 'http_proxy' before adding it to the proxies dictionary. This allows a remote attacker to redirect HTTP requests by setting the 'http_proxy' environment variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the 'name' variable is equal to 'http_proxy' before adding it to the proxies dictionary.
2. Use the 'os.environ.get' method to safely access environment variables.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle environment variables, such as using a whitelist of allowed variables.

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-1000110
CVE Description:
