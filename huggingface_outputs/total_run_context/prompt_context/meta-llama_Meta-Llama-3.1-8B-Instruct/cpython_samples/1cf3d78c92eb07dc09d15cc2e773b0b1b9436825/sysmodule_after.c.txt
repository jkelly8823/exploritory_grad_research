 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is a C implementation of the sys.get_int_max_str_digits function, which returns the maximum string digits limit for non-binary int<->str conversions. However, the code does not contain any code that would be affected by the CVE-2020-10735 vulnerability, which is related to the performance of int() function in Python. The code is a C implementation and does not use the int() function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities specific to C or the Python C API. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-10735
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in python. In algorithms with quadratic time complexity using non-binary bases, when using int("text"), a system could take 50ms to parse an int string with 100,000 digits and 5s for 1,000,000 digits (float, decimal, int.from_bytes(), and int() for binary bases 2, 4, 8
