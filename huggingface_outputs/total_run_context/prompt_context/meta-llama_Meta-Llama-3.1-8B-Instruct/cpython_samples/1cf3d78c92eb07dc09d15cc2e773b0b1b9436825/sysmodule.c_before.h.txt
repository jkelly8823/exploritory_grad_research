 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be Python code, but rather C code. The vulnerability CVE-2020-10735 is specific to Python and its implementation of int() function for non-binary bases. The code sample does not contain any Python code that would be affected by this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any Python code that would be affected by this vulnerability. However, if the code is intended to be used in a Python environment, it should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any Python code that could be vulnerable to this issue. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code sample appears to be a C code snippet, possibly generated by a code generator, and does not contain any Python code that could be vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735.  The code snippet defines a macro for a method definition, which is not related to the Python int() function.  Therefore, the code sample is not vulnerable to CVE-2020-10735.  However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code snippet does not contain
