VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4238 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is evident in the line where the'subjectAltName' is set to (('DNS', 'linuxfr.org'),), which contains a domain name with a '\0' character.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the domain names in the'subjectAltName' field do not contain any '\0' characters.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle X.509 certificates, such as using a library that properly handles '\0' characters in domain names. 
3. Update the code to use the latest version of the ssl module, which includes a fix for this vulnerability. 4.
