 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-0845 due to the use of SimpleXMLRPCServer in the tearDown method. The server is not properly configured to handle partial POST requests, which can cause an infinite loop and CPU consumption. Additionally, the test_partial_post method is testing for this vulnerability by sending a partial POST request to the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the SimpleXMLRPCServer library to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2012-0845 (e.g. Python 2.6.8 or later, Python 2.7.3 or later, Python 3.1.5 or later, or Python 3.2.3 or later).
2. Implement proper error handling and validation for POST requests to prevent infinite loops and CPU consumption.
3. Consider using a more secure and modern XML-RPC library, such as xmlrpc.server, which is designed to be more secure and efficient. 
4. Remove the test_partial_post method, as it is testing for a known vulnerability and may not be relevant in a production environment. 5. Update the tearDown method to properly close the
