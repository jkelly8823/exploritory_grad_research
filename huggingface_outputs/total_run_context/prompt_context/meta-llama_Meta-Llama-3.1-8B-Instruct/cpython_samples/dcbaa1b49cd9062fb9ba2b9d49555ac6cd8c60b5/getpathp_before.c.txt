 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Trojan horse python3.dll attack. This occurs because the code uses an invalid search path for python3.dll loading after Py_SetPath has been used. This is a known issue in Python 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.8, 3.8 through 3.8.4rc1, and 3.9 through 3.9.0b4 on Windows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Python that is not affected by this vulnerability.
2. Use a secure method to load the python3.dll, such as using a secure search path or loading the DLL from a trusted location.
3. Consider using a different method to load the python3.dll, such as using a manifest file to specify the DLL's location. 
4. Ensure that the code is running in a standard (non-embedded) Python installation on Windows to prevent this issue. 5. Consider using a sandboxed environment to run the code to prevent any potential attacks. 6. Regularly update and patch the Python installation to prevent any known
