 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be written in Python, but rather in C. The vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15523 is specific to Python 3.6 through 3.9 on Windows, and involves the use of a Trojan horse python3.dll in cases where CPython is embedded in a native application. This code sample does not involve the use of Python or the loading of python3.dll, so it is not vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any Python code and is therefore not vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is worth noting that the code does contain a call to _Py_CheckPython3(), which may be a Python-specific function. Further analysis of this function and its usage would be necessary to determine if it poses any other security risks.  ```python
