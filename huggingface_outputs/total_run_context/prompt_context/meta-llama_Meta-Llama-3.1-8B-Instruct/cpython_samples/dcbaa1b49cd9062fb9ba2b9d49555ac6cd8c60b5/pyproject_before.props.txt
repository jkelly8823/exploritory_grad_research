 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be Python code, but rather a snippet from a Visual Studio project file (.vcxproj). The vulnerability described in CVE-2020-15523 is specific to Python 3.6 through 3.9 on Windows, and involves the use of a Trojan horse python3.dll in cases where CPython is embedded in a native application. This code sample does not contain any Python code, so it is not vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not Python code, so no recommendations can be made. However, if the intention is to use this code in a Python project, it would be recommended to ensure that the Python installation is standard (non-embedded) and that the python.exe is used instead of python3.dll. This can be achieved by setting the PATH environment variable to include the Python installation directory. Additionally, it would be recommended to use a secure method to load the python3.dll, such as using the Py_SetPath function.
