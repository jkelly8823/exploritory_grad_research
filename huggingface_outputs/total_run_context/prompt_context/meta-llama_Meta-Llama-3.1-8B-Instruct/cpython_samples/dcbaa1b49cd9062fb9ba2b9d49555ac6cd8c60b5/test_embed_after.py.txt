 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Trojan horse attack due to the use of an invalid search path for loading python3.dll. This is a known issue in Python 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.8, 3.8 through 3.8.4rc1, and 3.9 through 3.9.0b4 on Windows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Python that is not affected by this issue.
2. Use a secure method to load python3.dll, such as using the `Py_SetPath` function to set the search path.
3. Consider using a virtual environment to isolate the Python installation and prevent the use of a Trojan horse python3.dll.
