 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code is checking for the presence of the python3.dll module and attempting to load it using the GetModuleHandleW function. This is a valid and safe way to load a DLL on Windows. The code also checks for the presence of the module before attempting to use it, which further reduces the risk of a Trojan horse attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described vulnerability.
