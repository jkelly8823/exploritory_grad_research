 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the use of the yield statement in the else block. This can lead to an infinite loop if the event is not properly handled, causing the parser to consume excessive resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the event is properly handled before yielding it.
2. Consider using a more robust parsing mechanism to prevent resource consumption.
3. Implement a timeout or limit on the number of iterations to prevent denial of service attacks. 
VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-52425
CVE Description:
libexpat through 2.5.0 allows a denial of service (resource consumption) because many full reparsings are required in the case of a large token for which multiple buffer fills are needed.
