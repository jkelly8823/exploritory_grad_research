 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the presence of a large token. The code is a simple unit test assertion and does not involve any parsing or processing of large tokens.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications to address the potential vulnerability.  The vulnerability is related to libexpat, which is not used in this code sample.  The code is a simple unit test and does not involve any parsing or processing of large tokens.  The assertion is a simple equality check and does not involve any resource-intensive operations.
