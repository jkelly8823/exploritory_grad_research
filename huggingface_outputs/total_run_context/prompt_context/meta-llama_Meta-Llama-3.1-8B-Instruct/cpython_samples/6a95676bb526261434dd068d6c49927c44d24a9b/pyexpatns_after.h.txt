 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a set of macro definitions for an XML parsing library. It does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the described vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVE descriptions are related to resource consumption and denial of service attacks, which are typically caused by specific code paths or edge cases. The provided code sample does not seem to implement any of the vulnerable functions or mechanisms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is essential to ensure that the underlying library (libexpat) is up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, proper error handling and resource management should be implemented in any code that uses this library.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
