 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code appears to be a JSON object containing checksum information for a file, and does not involve the use of the libexpat library or any other code that would be susceptible to the described vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to keep dependencies up to date and to use secure coding practices when working with libraries like libexpat.
