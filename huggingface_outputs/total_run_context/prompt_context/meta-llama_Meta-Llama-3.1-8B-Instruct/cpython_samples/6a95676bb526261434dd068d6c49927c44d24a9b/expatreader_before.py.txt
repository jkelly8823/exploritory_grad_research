 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the potential for an infinite loop in the _err_handler.fatalError(exc) method. This is because the method is called with an exception object (exc) without any error handling or validation, which could lead to an infinite recursion if the exception is not properly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error handling to the _err_handler.fatalError(exc) method to prevent infinite recursion.
2. Validate the exception object (exc) before passing it to the _err_handler.fatalError(exc) method to prevent potential resource consumption issues.
3. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as a try-except block, to handle exceptions in a more controlled manner.
