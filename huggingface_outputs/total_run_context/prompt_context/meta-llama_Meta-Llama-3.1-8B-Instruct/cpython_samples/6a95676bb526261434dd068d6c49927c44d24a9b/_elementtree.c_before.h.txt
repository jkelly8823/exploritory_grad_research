 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the potential for many full reparsings in the case of a large token for which multiple buffer fills are needed. This is a known issue in libexpat through 2.5.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade libexpat to a version greater than 2.5.0 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of the token or buffer to prevent excessive reparsings.
3. Consider using a more robust XML parsing library that is not affected by this vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
