 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the use of the `pyexpat` library, which is affected by the CVE-2023-52425 vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the library to consume excessive resources by feeding it a large token that requires multiple buffer fills.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the `pyexpat` library to a version that is not affected by the CVE-2023-52425 vulnerability, such as version 2.5.1 or later.
2. Consider using a different XML parsing library that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `lxml`. 
3. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent an attacker from feeding the library a large token that could cause resource consumption. 
4. Consider using a library that provides a way to limit the amount of memory used by the parser, such as `xml.sax` or `xml.dom`. 
5. If possible, use a streaming parser that can process XML data in chunks, rather than loading the entire document into memory at once.  VULNERABILITY LIST
