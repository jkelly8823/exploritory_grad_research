 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (resource consumption) due to the repeated reparsing of large tokens. This is a known issue in libexpat through version 2.5.0, as described in CVE-2023-52425.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider upgrading libexpat to a version greater than 2.5.0. Alternatively, you can implement a custom parser that avoids the repeated reparsing of large tokens. Additionally, consider adding input validation and sanitization to prevent large tokens from being processed in the first place. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-52425
CVE Description:
libexpat through 2.5.0 allows a denial of service (resource consumption) because many full reparsings are required in the case of a large token for which multiple buffer fills are needed.
