 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a set of macro definitions for XML parsing functions. It does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The CVEs are related to libexpat, a C library for parsing XML and HTML documents, and are not directly related to the provided code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, if the code is intended to be used with libexpat, it is recommended to ensure that the version of libexpat being used is up-to-date and patched against the CVEs. Additionally, consider using a more modern and secure XML parsing library if possible.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
