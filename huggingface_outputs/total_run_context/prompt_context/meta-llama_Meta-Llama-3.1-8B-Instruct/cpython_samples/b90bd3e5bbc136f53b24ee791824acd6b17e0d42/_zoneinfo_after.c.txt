 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-457 because the variables 'utcoff' and 'dstoff' are not initialized before being used. This can lead to unpredictable or unintended results, as the values of these variables are not defined.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the variables 'utcoff' and 'dstoff' before using them. This can be done by assigning them a default value or by checking if they are NULL before using them. For example:
```c
long *utcoff = malloc(sizeof(long));
long *dstoff = malloc(sizeof(long));
```
Alternatively, you can also use a safer approach by using a struct to store the values and then accessing them through the struct. This way, you can ensure that the variables are properly initialized and accessed.
```c
typedef struct {
    long utcoff;
    long dstoff;
} zoneinfo_data;

zoneinfo_data data;
data.utcoff = 0;
data.dstoff = 0;
```VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID:476
