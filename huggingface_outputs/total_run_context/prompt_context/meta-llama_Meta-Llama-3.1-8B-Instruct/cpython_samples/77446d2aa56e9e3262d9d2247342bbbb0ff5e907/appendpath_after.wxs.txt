 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-26488 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the InstallScope attribute set to "perUser", which allows a local attacker to add user-writable directories to the system search path. This can be exploited by a non-administrative user to gain privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the InstallScope attribute should be set to "perMachine" instead of "perUser". This will prevent user-writable directories from being added to the system search path. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the PATH entries are correctly configured and not allowing search-path hijacking of other users and system services. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-26488
CVE Description:
In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges because the search path is inadequately secured. The installer may allow a local attacker to add user-writable directories to the system search path. To exploit, an administrator must have installed Python for all users and enabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can trigger a repair that incorrectly adds
