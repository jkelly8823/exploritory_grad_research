 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be written in Python, but rather in a Windows Installer XML (WiX) format. The vulnerability described in CVE-2022-26488 is specific to Python installations on Windows, and does not apply to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any Python code, and therefore is not vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to ensure that any Python installations on the system are up-to-date and properly configured to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-26488
CVE Description:
In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges because the search path is inadequately secured. The installer may allow a local attacker to add user-writable directories to the system search path. To exploit, an administrator must have installed Python for all users and enabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can trigger a repair that incorrectly adds user-writable paths into PATH, enabling search-path hijacking of other users and system services. This affects Python (CPython) through 3.7
