 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the readline method. The readline method returns a string that includes a newline character, but it does not properly handle the case where the input list is empty. When the input list is empty, the readline method will return an empty string, but it will not remove the newline character from the string. This can cause the readline method to return a string with a trailing newline character, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method. Additionally, the readline method does not check if the input list is empty before attempting to pop an element from it, which can cause an IndexError if the list is empty.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to the readline method to ensure that the input list is not empty before attempting to pop an element from it.
2. Modify the readline method to properly handle the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty string without the newline character.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a queue, to handle the input list to avoid potential memory leaks.
