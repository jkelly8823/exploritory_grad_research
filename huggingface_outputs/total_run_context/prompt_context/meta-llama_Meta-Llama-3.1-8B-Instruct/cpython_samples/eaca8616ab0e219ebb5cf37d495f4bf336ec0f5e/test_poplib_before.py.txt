 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string formatting with user input in the `cmd_list` method. The `arg` variable is not sanitized, and it is directly used in the string formatting, which can lead to an injection attack if the input is malicious. Additionally, the `self.assertEqual` method is used with user input, which can also lead to an injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Sanitize user input before using it in string formatting or comparisons.
3. Consider using a library like `sqlalchemy` to handle database interactions and prevent SQL injection attacks.
