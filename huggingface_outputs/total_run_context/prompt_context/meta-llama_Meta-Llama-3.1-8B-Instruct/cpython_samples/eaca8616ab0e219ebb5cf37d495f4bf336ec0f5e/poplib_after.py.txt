 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The _getline() method reads a line from the file and checks if its length is greater than _MAXLINE. However, it does not check if the line contains any null bytes. If a malicious server sends a line with a null byte, it can cause the program to read beyond the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for null bytes in the line before checking its length.
2. Use a safer method to read lines from the file, such as using a library that handles buffer overflows for you.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as TLS, to encrypt the communication between the client and server.
