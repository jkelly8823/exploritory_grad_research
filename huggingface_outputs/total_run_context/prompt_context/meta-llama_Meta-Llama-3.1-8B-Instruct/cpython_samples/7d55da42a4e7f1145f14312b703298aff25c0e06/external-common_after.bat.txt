 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL CCS Injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224). The code is a batch script that checks for the existence of certain directories and downloads or removes them as needed. It does not appear to involve any direct use of OpenSSL or TLS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified vulnerability. However, it is worth noting that the code is using an older version of OpenSSL (1.0.1h) which may have other security vulnerabilities. It may be worth considering updating to a more recent version of OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0224
CVE Description:
OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive
