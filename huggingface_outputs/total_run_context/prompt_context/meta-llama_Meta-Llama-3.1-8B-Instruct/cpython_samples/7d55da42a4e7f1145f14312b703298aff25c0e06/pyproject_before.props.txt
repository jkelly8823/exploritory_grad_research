 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any direct references to OpenSSL, which is the library affected by the CVE-2014-0224 vulnerability. The code is simply defining directory paths for various external libraries, including OpenSSL, but it does not include any code that would utilize the vulnerable OpenSSL functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations for fixes are necessary. However, it is recommended to ensure that the OpenSSL library being used is up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL if possible.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0224
CVE Description:
OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake
