 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL CCS Injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224). The code is a batch script that checks for the existence of certain directories and downloads or removes them as needed. It does not appear to involve any direct use of OpenSSL or TLS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified vulnerability. However, it is worth noting that the code is using an older version of OpenSSL (1.0.1g) which may have other vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use a more recent version of OpenSSL. Additionally, the code is using a SVN export to download the OpenSSL source code, which may not be the most reliable method for obtaining the latest version of the library. Consider using a more modern method for downloading and installing dependencies.  ```bash
