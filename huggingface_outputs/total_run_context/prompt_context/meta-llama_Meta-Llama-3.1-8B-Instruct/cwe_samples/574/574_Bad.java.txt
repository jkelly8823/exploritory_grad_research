VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to thread safety issues due to the use of the synchronized keyword on setter methods. This can lead to performance issues and deadlocks in a multi-threaded environment. The Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification does not require the use of thread synchronization primitives, and in fact, recommends avoiding them. The use of synchronized methods can also lead to performance issues and deadlocks in a multi-threaded environment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the synchronized keyword from the setter methods.
2. Consider using a thread-safe alternative, such as using a lock or a thread-safe collection.
3. Review the code to ensure that it is thread-safe and does not contain any other thread-related issues.
