 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-15
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement. The switch statement is intended to print the name of the month based on the input, but the code does not follow the correct sequence of cases. The correct sequence should be a single case statement for each month, without any fall-through to the next case. The current implementation will print the name of the month for the first case (January) and then print the name of the month for the next 11 cases, resulting in incorrect behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the fall-through behavior by adding a break statement at the end of each case.
2. Use a single case statement for each month, without any fall-through to the next case.
3. Consider using an array or a struct to store the month names and their corresponding numbers, making the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

CWE_ID: 670
CWE Description:
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement, leading to incorrect behavior any time this path is navigated
