 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check if the email address is empty before asserting that it is not null. This can lead to a NullPointerException if the email address is empty. The assert statement is not a substitute for proper null checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the assert statement with a proper null check. For example, you can use the isEmpty() method of the String class to check if the email address is empty. Here is an example of how you can do it: 
if (email.isEmpty()) { 
    // handle the case when the email address is empty
} else {
    // proceed with the rest of the code
} 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code does not properly validate user input, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

Code Sample:

String email = request.getParameter("email_address");if (email.contains("@")) {
    // proceed with the validation
} else {
    // handle the case when the email address does not contain the "@" symbol
}
