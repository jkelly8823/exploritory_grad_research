EXPLANATION:
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement. The condition is checked, but regardless of the result, both Do_X() and Do_Y() are executed. This is an example of a non-sequitur, where the code does not follow the expected control flow. This can lead to incorrect behavior when this path is navigated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reorder the statements to reflect the correct control flow. The correct code should be: if (condition==true) { Do_X(); Do_Y(); } else { /* handle the else condition */ }
2. Consider adding a comment to explain the purpose of the non-sequitur and why it is necessary. This will help future developers understand the code and make informed decisions. 
3. Review the code to ensure that the non-sequitur is not causing any unintended side effects. 4. Consider refactoring the code to make it more readable and maintainable. 5. Test the code thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected. 6. Consider using a code review tool to identify any other potential issues. 7. Document the
