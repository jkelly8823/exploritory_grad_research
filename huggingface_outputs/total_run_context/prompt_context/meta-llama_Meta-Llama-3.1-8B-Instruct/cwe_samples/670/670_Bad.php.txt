 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement. The algorithm is intended to check if the requesting IP is in the allowed list, and if not, redirect to the error page. However, the code does not check if the requesting IP is in the allowed list before redirecting to the error page. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the requesting IP is not in the allowed list.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the check for the requesting IP in the allowed list before the redirect to the error page.
2. Use a more secure method to handle the redirect, such as using a header redirect instead of a function call.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve the allowed IP list, such as using a database or a secure configuration file. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The code contains a function call that is not properly validated, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

               $status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
              ...
