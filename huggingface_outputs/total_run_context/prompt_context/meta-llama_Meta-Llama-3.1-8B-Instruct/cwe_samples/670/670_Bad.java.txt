 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-15
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement. The switch statement is intended to print the name of the month based on the input, but the code does not follow the correct control flow. The cases are not properly separated, and the code will print the name of the month for the first case (January) regardless of the input. This is because the switch statement is not properly formatted, and the code will always execute the first case.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly format the switch statement by adding a break statement at the end of each case.
2. Remove the unnecessary cases and use a more efficient way to print the month name, such as using an array or a map.
3. Use a more robust way to handle invalid input, such as throwing an exception or returning an error message.

CWE_ID: 670
CWE Description:
The code contains a control flow path that does not reflect the algorithm that the path is intended to implement, leading to incorrect behavior any time this path is navigated.  The code will always print "January
