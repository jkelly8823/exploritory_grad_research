 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of session invalidation after a new user session is established. The form is submitting to the j_security_check URL, which is a common URL for authentication in Java-based applications. However, the existing session identifier is not invalidated, allowing an attacker to steal an authenticated session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the application should invalidate the existing session identifier after a new user session is established. This can be achieved by adding a session invalidation mechanism, such as setting the session ID to null or using a secure random number generator to generate a new session ID. Additionally, the application should ensure that the session fixation protection mechanism is enabled. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89

                  $name = $_GET['name'];
                  echo "<h1>Hello, $name!</h1>";
                 ?>
                  </div>
