EXPLANATION:
The code does not lock the resource (accountBalance) when it is being accessed and modified by multiple threads. This can lead to data inconsistency and unexpected behavior. The deposit and withdraw methods are not thread-safe.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, you can use synchronization techniques such as the synchronized keyword in Java or the Lock object from the java.util.concurrent.locks package. For example, you can synchronize the deposit and withdraw methods to ensure that only one thread can access and modify the accountBalance at a time. Here is an example of how you can modify the deposit method to be thread-safe:
```java
public synchronized void deposit(double depositAmount) {
    double newBalance = accountBalance + depositAmount;
    accountBalance = newBalance;
}
```
Similarly, you can modify the withdraw method to be thread-safe:
```java
public synchronized void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {
    double newBalance = accountBalance - withdrawAmount;
    accountBalance = newBalance;
}
```
Alternatively, you can use a ReentrantLock to achieve thread-safety:
```java
private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
