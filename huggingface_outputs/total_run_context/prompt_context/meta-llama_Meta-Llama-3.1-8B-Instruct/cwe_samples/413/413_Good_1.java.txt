 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-24, 35-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a deadlock situation. This is because the withdraw method is waiting for the deposit method to signal that sufficient funds are available, but the deposit method is waiting for the withdraw method to release the lock. This creates a deadlock situation where both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a more robust locking mechanism, such as a ReadWriteLock, or to use a different synchronization strategy, such as using a single lock for all operations. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the locking mechanism is properly implemented and that the condition object is used correctly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not check for an error or exception condition that it should check for.

Code Sample:

                  public class BankAccount {
                       ...
                           // method to deposit amount into BankAccount
                           public void deposit(double amount) {
                              
                                 
                                 // set lock to block access to BankAccount from other threads
                                 balanceChangeLock.lock();try {
                                    double newBalance
