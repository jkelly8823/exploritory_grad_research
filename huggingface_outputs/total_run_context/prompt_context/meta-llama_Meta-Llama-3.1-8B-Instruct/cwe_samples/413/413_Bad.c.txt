 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to CWE-413: Inconsistent Locks. Although the mutex is locked before accessing the shared resource, it is not locked consistently throughout the function. The mutex is unlocked immediately after accessing the shared resource, which means that other threads may access the shared resource before the current thread has finished using it. This can lead to data corruption or other concurrency issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the mutex should be locked consistently throughout the function. This can be achieved by moving the `pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);` line to the end of the function, after all shared resources have been accessed. Additionally, consider using a lock guard or a RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom to ensure that the mutex is always unlocked when it goes out of scope. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 122
CWE Description:
The product uses a hard-coded string as a password, credential, or other sensitive data.

Code Sample:

                  #define SECRET "mysecretpassword"
                  int main() {
                        char password[10];
                        strcpy(password, SECRET);
                        //...
                  }
