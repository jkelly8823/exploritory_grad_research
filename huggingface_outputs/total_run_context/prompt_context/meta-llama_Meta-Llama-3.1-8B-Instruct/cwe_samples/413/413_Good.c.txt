 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-413 because it does not correctly lock the mutex before accessing the shared resource. Although the mutex is locked, the unlock operation is performed immediately after the lock operation, which means the mutex is unlocked before the shared resource is accessed. This can lead to a race condition where another thread can access the shared resource before the current thread has finished with it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the unlock operation to after the shared resource has been accessed.
2. Consider using a lock guard or a RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom to ensure the mutex is unlocked even if an exception is thrown.
