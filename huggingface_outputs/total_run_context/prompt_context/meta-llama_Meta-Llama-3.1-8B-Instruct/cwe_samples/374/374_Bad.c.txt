 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-374 because it passes mutable objects (foo, bar, and baz) as arguments to the doOtherStuff method of the externalClass. This can lead to unintended modifications of the original objects, potentially causing security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider cloning the mutable objects before passing them to the doOtherStuff method. This can be achieved by creating new instances of the objects and copying their values. For example: 
```java
public:void doStuff() {
    int fooCopy = foo;
    complexType barCopy = bar.clone();
    String bazCopy = baz;
    externalClass.doOtherStuff(fooCopy, barCopy, bazCopy);
}
```
Alternatively, you can also consider using immutable objects or defensive copying to prevent modifications of the original objects.```java
public:void doStuff() {
    externalClass.doOtherStuff(foo, bar, baz);
    // defensive copying
    foo = foo;
    bar = bar.clone();
    baz = baz;
}
```````
