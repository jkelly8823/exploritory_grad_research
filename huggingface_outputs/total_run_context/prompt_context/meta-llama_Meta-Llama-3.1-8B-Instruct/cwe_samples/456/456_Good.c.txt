 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The variable test_string is not initialized before it is used in the printf function. The variable is initialized with a string literal "Done at the beginning" but then reassigned to "Hello World!" when the condition i!= err_val is met. However, if the condition is not met, the variable remains uninitialized and the printf function will print garbage values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the variable test_string before using it. This can be done by assigning it a default value or by checking if it is null before using it. For example:
char *test_string = NULL;
if (i!= err_val)
{
test_string = "Hello World!";
}
printf("%s", test_string); 
Note: The variable test_string should be checked for null before using it to prevent a segmentation fault.
