 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code does not initialize the $isAdmin variable before using it. This can cause unexpected behavior if the authenticate and setAdmin functions return false. The variable is used in the second if statement to determine whether to delete a user. If the authenticate and setAdmin functions return false, the $isAdmin variable will be false, but the code will still attempt to delete the user.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the $isAdmin variable before using it. This can be done by setting it to false before the if statement. For example: $isAdmin = false; if (authenticate($username,$password) && setAdmin($username)){$isAdmin = true;} This will ensure that the variable is initialized before it is used.

                     if ($isAdmin){deleteUser($userToDelete);}
