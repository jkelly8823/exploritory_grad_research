 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check if the sscanf function was successful in parsing the input into the variables m and n. If the input is not in the correct format, the variables m and n will not be initialized correctly, leading to undefined behavior. This is a classic example of a CWE-456 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of sscanf to ensure it was successful in parsing the input.
2. Use a safer function to parse the input, such as strtok or a regular expression library.
3. Consider using a more robust input validation mechanism, such as a whitelist of allowed input formats. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
                        int x;
                        int y = 5;
                        x = y + 1;
                        return 0;
                     }

EXPLANATION:
The variable x is indeed used before it is initialized, but the code does
