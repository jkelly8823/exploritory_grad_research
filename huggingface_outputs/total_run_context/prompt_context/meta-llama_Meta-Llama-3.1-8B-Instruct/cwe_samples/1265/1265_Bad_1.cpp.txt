 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1265 due to the non-reentrant nature of the setup method. The setup method is called from the send method, which in turn calls the setup method again, leading to a nested invocation of the non-reentrant code. This can cause unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the setup method should be made reentrant by removing the non-reentrant operations or by using a lock to synchronize access to shared resources. Additionally, the send method should be modified to avoid calling the setup method unnecessarily. For example, the setup method could be called only once, when the Request object is created, and the uri attribute could be cached to avoid repeated calls to the setup method.
