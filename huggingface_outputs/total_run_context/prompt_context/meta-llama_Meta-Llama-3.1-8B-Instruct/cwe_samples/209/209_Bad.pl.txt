 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-209 because it includes sensitive information about the user's username in the error message. This could potentially reveal information about the user's account or other sensitive data. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to CWE-78 because it includes a hardcoded path to the configuration directory, which could be used by an attacker to manipulate the code's behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to handle error messages, such as logging the error instead of displaying it to the user.
2. Use a more secure method to store the configuration directory path, such as using a configuration file or environment variable.
3. Validate the username input more thoroughly to prevent CWE-22. For example, you could use a regular expression to ensure the username only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to handle file existence checks, such as using a try-except block instead of relying on the -e operator.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 22 CWE Description: Path Traversal CWE_ID: 78 CWE Description: OS Command Injection CWE_ID: 209 CWE Description: Error Message
