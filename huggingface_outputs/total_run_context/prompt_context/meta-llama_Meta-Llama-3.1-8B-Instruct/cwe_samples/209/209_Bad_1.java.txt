 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-209 because it includes sensitive information about the database query in the error message. This information could potentially be used by an attacker to exploit the system. The query string is concatenated directly into the error message, which could reveal the structure of the database and potentially allow an attacker to craft a malicious query.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Remove sensitive information from the error message, such as the database query string.
3. Consider using a logging framework that can handle sensitive information securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
