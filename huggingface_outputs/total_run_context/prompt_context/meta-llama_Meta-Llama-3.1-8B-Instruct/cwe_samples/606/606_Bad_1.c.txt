 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-606 because the loop condition in the for loop is not properly checked. The loop will run indefinitely if the message length is greater than MESSAGE_SIZE. This can lead to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the message length is less than or equal to MESSAGE_SIZE before copying the message body into the string.
2. Consider using a safer method to copy the message body, such as using a loop that checks for the null terminator.
3. Consider using a more robust method to process the message, such as using a buffer that can handle variable-length messages. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product does not properly check for integer overflows when performing arithmetic operations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

                  int processMessageFromSocket(int socket) {
                        int success;
                           char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];char message[MESSAGE_SIZE];
                           
                           // get message from socket and store into buffer
                           
                           
                           //Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER_SIZE
