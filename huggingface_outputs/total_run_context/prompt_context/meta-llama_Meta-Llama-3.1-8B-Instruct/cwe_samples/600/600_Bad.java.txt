 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code does not catch any exceptions that may occur when calling InetAddress.getByName(ip) or addr.getHostName(). If an exception occurs, it will be propagated up the call stack and may reveal sensitive debugging information. This is a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Catch the IOException that may be thrown by InetAddress.getByName(ip) and handle it appropriately.
2. Catch the UnknownHostException that may be thrown by InetAddress.getByName(ip) and handle it appropriately.
3. Catch the NullPointerException that may be thrown by addr.getHostName() and handle it appropriately. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code does not validate the input from the HttpServletRequest object, which may lead to a potential security vulnerability.

Code Sample:

                  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {String username = req.getParameter("username");String password = req.getParameter("password");...out.println("hello " + username);}
