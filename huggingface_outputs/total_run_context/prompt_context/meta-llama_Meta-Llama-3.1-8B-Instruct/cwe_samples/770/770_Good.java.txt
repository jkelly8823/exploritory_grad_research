EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-770 because it allows an attacker to create an arbitrary number of threads, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is because the ExecutorService is created with a fixed thread pool size of MAX_CONNECTIONS, but the code does not enforce any limits on the number of threads that can be executed. An attacker can create a large number of threads by sending multiple connections to the server, causing the thread pool to grow indefinitely.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Enforce a limit on the number of threads that can be executed by the ExecutorService. This can be done by using a ThreadPoolExecutor with a core pool size and a maximum pool size.
2. Consider using a connection pool instead of creating a new thread for each connection.
3. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent DoS attacks, such as rate limiting or IP blocking. 4. Regularly monitor the system for signs of a DoS attack and take corrective action if necessary. 5. Consider using a load balancer to distribute incoming connections across multiple servers. 6. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent thread exhaustion, such as
