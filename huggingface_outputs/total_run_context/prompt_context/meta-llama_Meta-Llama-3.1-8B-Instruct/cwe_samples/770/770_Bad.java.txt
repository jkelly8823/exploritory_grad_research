 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-770 because it allows an unlimited number of threads to be created, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The while loop continues to accept connections and create new threads until the hasConnections flag is set to false. However, there is no mechanism to limit the number of threads that can be created, allowing an attacker to consume all available system resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of threads that can be created, such as a maximum thread count or a queue to hold incoming connections.
2. Consider using a thread pool to manage the creation and execution of threads.
3. Add a check to ensure that the hasConnections flag is set to false before entering the while loop, to prevent an infinite loop in case of an error.
