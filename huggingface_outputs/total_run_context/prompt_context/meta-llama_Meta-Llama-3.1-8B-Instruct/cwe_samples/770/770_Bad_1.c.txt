 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-770 because it does not impose any restrictions on the size or number of files that can be written to disk. The `openFileToWrite` function is called without any checks on the filename, which could potentially lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker can provide a large number of files to be written.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the filename is valid and does not exceed a certain size limit.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of files that can be written to disk.
3. Consider using a more secure method to open files, such as using a file descriptor instead of a filename. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The application uses a variable-length string input from an untrusted source without checking the length of the input.

Code Sample:

                  int writeDataFromSocketToFile(char *host, int port){
                        
                           char filename[FILENAME_SIZE];char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];int socket = openSocketConnection(host, port);
                           if (socket < 0) {printf("Unable to open socket
