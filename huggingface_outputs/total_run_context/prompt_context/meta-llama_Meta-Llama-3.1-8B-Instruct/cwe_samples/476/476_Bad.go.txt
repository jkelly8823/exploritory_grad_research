 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential dereference of a NULL pointer. This is because the client.Do() function returns a response and an error, but if the error is not nil, the function will return immediately without checking if the response is nil. This means that if the client.Do() function returns a nil response, the code will attempt to close the response.Body, which will result in a panic.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the response is nil before attempting to close its body.
2. Use a try-catch block to handle the error and prevent the function from returning immediately. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input without proper validation as input to an internal implementation.

Code Sample:

                  func GetUsernameFromCookie(cookie string) string {
                        // Extract the username from the cookie
                        username := strings.Split(cookie, ";")[0]
                        return username
                  }
