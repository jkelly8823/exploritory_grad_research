 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-390 because it does not handle the exception thrown when the file cannot be opened. The exception is caught and re-thrown, but the file is not properly closed before re-throwing the exception. This can lead to a resource leak. Additionally, the code does not check if the file was successfully opened before attempting to read from it, which can lead to another resource leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Close the file before re-throwing the exception in the catch block.
2. Check if the file was successfully opened before attempting to read from it.
3. Use a smart pointer to manage the memory allocated for the buffer to avoid memory leaks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
                        int n = 10;
                        int arr[n]; // VLA
                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                              arr[i] = i;
                        }
                        return 0;
