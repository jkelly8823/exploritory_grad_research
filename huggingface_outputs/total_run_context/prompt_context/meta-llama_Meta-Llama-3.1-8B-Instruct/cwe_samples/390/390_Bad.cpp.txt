 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the exception that is thrown when the file cannot be opened or read. The exception is caught by the catch block, but it does not provide any meaningful error message or handle the situation. This is a potential security vulnerability as it may allow an attacker to exploit the application by providing a malicious file name.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Handle the exception by providing a meaningful error message and logging the error.
2. Consider using a more secure way to handle file operations, such as using a try-catch block for each file operation.
3. Use a secure way to allocate memory, such as using smart pointers or containers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The application uses a fixed-size buffer to store data from an untrusted source, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Code Sample:

                  char* readfile (char *filename) {
                        try {
                              // open input fileifstream infile;infile.open(filename);
                                 if (!infile.is_open()) {throw "Unable to open file " + filename;}
                                 // get length of fileinfile.seekg (0, ios
