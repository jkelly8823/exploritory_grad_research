 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the error when malloc fails. It checks if malloc failed, but does nothing when it does. This is a vulnerability because it can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior if the program continues to execute with a NULL pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of malloc and handle the error properly. This can be done by freeing the memory and returning an error code or by re-allocating the memory.
2. Use a more modern and safe way of handling memory allocation, such as using smart pointers or containers that handle memory management for you. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

}

EXPLANATION:
The variable x is declared but not initialized before it is used in the if statement. This can lead to undefined behavior, as the value
