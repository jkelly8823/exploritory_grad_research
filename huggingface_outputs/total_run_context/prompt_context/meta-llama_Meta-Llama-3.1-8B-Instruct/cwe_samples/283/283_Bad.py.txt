 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not properly verify that the process ID is owned by the proper entity before attempting to kill it. This can lead to a situation where the process ID is not valid or is owned by a different entity, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. The lack of input validation and ownership verification makes the code vulnerable to CWE-283.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation to ensure that the process ID is a valid integer.
2. Verify the ownership of the process ID before attempting to kill it.
3. Consider using a more robust method to kill processes, such as using the `psutil` library, which provides a safer and more reliable way to interact with processes.

def main():
    userInput = input("Enter a string: ")

        print("Input is valid")
    else:
        print("Input is invalid
