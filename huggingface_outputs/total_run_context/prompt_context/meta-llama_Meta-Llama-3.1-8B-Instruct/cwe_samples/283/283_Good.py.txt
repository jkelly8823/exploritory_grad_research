EXPLANATION:
The code does not properly verify that the process owner is the same as the requesting user. The function `getCurrentUser()` is used to get the current user, but it is not clear if this function is reliable or if it can be spoofed. Additionally, the `getProcessOwner(processID)` function is used to get the owner of the process, but it is not clear if this function is reliable or if it can be spoofed. The code assumes that the `os.kill()` function will only be called if the process owner is the same as the requesting user, but this is not guaranteed. A malicious user could potentially spoof the `getCurrentUser()` function to return a different user, allowing them to kill a process they do not own.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to verify the process owner, such as using the `psutil` library to get the process owner and comparing it to the current user.
2. Use a secure method to get the current user, such as using the `getpass` library to get the current user.
3. Add additional checks to ensure that the process owner is the same as the
