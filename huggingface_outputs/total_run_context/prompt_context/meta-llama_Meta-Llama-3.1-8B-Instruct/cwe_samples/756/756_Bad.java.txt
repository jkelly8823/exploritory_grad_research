 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the ApplicationSpecificException properly. It logs the exception but does not return a custom error page to the user. This could potentially expose sensitive information to the user. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Return a custom error page to the user when an ApplicationSpecificException is caught.
2. Consider logging sensitive information in a way that does not expose it to the user, such as logging the exception to a file or database without including sensitive information.
