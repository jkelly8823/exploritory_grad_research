 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is using the customErrors tag to configure custom error pages. However, the mode is set to "On", which means that the custom error pages will be displayed only if the error is not already being handled by the application. If the error is not handled, the defaultRedirect will be used. However, if the error is not being handled and the defaultRedirect is not a valid page, the error will be displayed to the user, possibly exposing sensitive information. This is a potential vulnerability as it may allow an attacker to access sensitive information about the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the mode should be set to "RemoteOnly" to prevent custom error pages from being displayed to users. Additionally, the defaultRedirect should be set to a valid page that handles the error in a secure manner. It is also recommended to handle errors in a centralized manner using a try-catch block to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.
