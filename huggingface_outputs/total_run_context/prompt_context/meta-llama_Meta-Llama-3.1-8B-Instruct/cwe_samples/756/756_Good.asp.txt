 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is using the customErrors tag to configure the error handling for the application. However, the mode is set to "RemoteOnly", which means that custom error pages will only be displayed to remote clients, not to local clients. This could potentially expose sensitive information to local clients, as they will see the default ASP.NET error page instead of a custom error page. This is a vulnerability because it may allow an attacker to gather information about the application's internal workings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the mode should be set to "On" instead of "RemoteOnly". This will ensure that custom error pages are displayed to all clients, including local ones. Additionally, it's recommended to configure the custom error pages to display a generic error message that does not reveal any sensitive information about the application. This can be done by setting the defaultRedirect attribute to a custom error page. For example: <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="~/ErrorPage.aspx">.
