 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1280 because the hardware-based access control check occurs after the asset has been accessed. In this case, the grant_access signal is assigned after the data_out is updated. This means that if the user ID is not 4, the data_out will be updated with the previous value of data_in, which may be sensitive information. This is a security risk because an attacker could potentially access sensitive information by manipulating the user ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the grant_access signal should be assigned before the data_out is updated. This can be done by moving the assign statement to before the if-else statement. Additionally, it would be a good practice to add a comment to explain the purpose of the grant_access signal and the access control logic. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 129
CWE Description:
The code of a control structure (e.g., if, while, for) is reachable from a point where a resource is released (e.g., return, break, continue).
Code Sample:

module foo_bar(data_out, usr_id, data_in, clk, rst_n);
