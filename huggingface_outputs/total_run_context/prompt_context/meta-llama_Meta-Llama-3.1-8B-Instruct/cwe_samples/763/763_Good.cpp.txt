 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to return a memory resource to the system by calling delete on the BarObj pointer. However, the new operator was used to allocate memory for the BarObj object, which means the correct release function should be delete. The code is vulnerable to a memory leak because the delete statement is not sufficient to release the memory allocated by the new operator. The correct way to release the memory would be to call delete on the pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the correct release function, which is delete, to release the memory allocated by the new operator. The corrected code should be: void foo(){ BarObj *ptr = new BarObj(); /* do some work with ptr here */... delete ptr; }
