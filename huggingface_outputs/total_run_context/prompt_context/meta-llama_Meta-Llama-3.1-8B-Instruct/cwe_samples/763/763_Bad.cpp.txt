 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free a dynamically allocated memory resource using the free() function, which is incorrect. The correct function to free memory allocated with new is delete. This is a classic example of a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the free() function with delete to correctly free the memory resource. The corrected code should look like this: void foo(){ BarObj *ptr = new BarObj(); /* do some work with ptr here */... delete ptr; }
