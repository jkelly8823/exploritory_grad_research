 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-763 because it calls the wrong release function for the memory allocated by malloc. The free function is used to release the memory, but it is called on the token (tok) which is a pointer to a character in the input string, not the memory allocated by malloc. This will lead to a memory leak because the memory allocated by malloc is not released.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line where free is called to free the memory allocated by malloc, which is the input variable.
2. Consider using a safer memory management function like strdup to allocate memory for the token. This will ensure that the memory is properly released when it is no longer needed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product uses a fixed-size buffer to store data that may be larger than the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

                  
                     //hardcode input length for simplicity
                     char* input = (char*) malloc(40*sizeof(char));char *tok;char* sep = " \t";
                     get_user_input( input );
                     
                     /*
