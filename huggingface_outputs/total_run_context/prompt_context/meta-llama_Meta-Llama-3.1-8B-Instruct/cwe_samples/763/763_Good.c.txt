 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 12, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-763 because it attempts to free the memory allocated for the string "Search Me!" twice. The first free is called when a matching character is found, and the second free is called when the loop completes without finding a match. This can lead to a double-free error, which can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the free(str) call to a single location, such as after the loop completes, to ensure that the memory is only freed once.
2. Consider using a smart pointer or a container class to manage the memory, which can help prevent memory leaks and double-free errors. 
3. Use a more modern and safe way of handling strings, such as using std::string in C++ or a similar class in other languages. 
4. Always check the return value of malloc to ensure that the memory allocation was successful before attempting to use the allocated memory. 5. Consider using a memory debugging tool to help identify and fix memory-related issues. 6. Review the code to ensure that all memory is properly freed when it is no longer
