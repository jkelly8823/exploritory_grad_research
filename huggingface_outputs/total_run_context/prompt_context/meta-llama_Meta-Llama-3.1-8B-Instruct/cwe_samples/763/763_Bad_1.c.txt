 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free the memory allocated for the string "Search Me!" twice. The first free is called when a match is found, and the second free is called when the loop ends. This is incorrect because the memory has already been freed once, and attempting to free it again will result in undefined behavior. The correct approach would be to free the memory only once, after the loop ends.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the free(str) statement to after the while loop ends, so that the memory is freed only once.
2. Consider using a more modern and safe way of handling memory, such as using smart pointers or containers that manage memory automatically.
