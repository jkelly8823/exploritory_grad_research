 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-941 because it does not correctly specify the intended destination for the actor when sending the response. The `sendResponse` function is called with the `requestIP` as an argument, but it does not verify if this IP address is the intended destination. This could lead to a communication channel being created to an unintended actor.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the intended destination IP address before sending the response. This can be done by checking if the `requestIP` matches the IP address of the server or a trusted IP address.
2. Use a secure method to specify the intended destination, such as using a secure protocol or a trusted third-party service. 
3. Consider using a more secure communication channel, such as TCP instead of UDP, which provides better security features. 
4. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent any potential attacks. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure.  ```python
def sendResponse(requestIP, record):
    # Verify the intended destination IP address
    if requestIP!= UDP_IP:
        print("Invalid IP address")
        return
