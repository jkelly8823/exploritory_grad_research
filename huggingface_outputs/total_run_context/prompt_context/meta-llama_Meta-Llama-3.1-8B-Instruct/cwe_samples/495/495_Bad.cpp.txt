 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-495 because the `fa()` and `fv()` methods return references to private data structures, allowing external modification of these structures. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the return types of `fa()` and `fv()` to return by value instead of reference, to prevent external modification of the private data structures.
2. Consider using const correctness to ensure that the returned values are not modified unintentionally.
3. Review the code to ensure that there are no other methods that return references to private data structures, and modify them accordingly.
