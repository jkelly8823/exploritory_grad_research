 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code declares a public static final field `USER_ROLES` which references a mutable object array. This allows the object to be changed by malicious code or accidentally from another package, violating the principle of immutability. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, declare the `USER_ROLES` field as a final array of immutable objects, such as `String` or `Enum`, or use a different data structure that is inherently immutable, like a `Set` or a `Map`. For example, `public static final String[] USER_ROLES = new String[] {"role1", "role2"};` or `public static final Set<String> USER_ROLES = Collections.unmodifiableSet(EnumSet.of("role1", "role2"));`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) does not perform a security check for improper input to methods that use reflection, resulting in a potential security vulnerability.

Code Sample:

                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                  try {
                  Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("com.example.MyClass");
