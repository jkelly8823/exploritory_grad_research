 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in this code has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of possessive quantifiers and backtracking. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker can manipulate the input to cause the regular expression engine to take an excessive amount of time to process. The regular expression engine will continue to try to match the pattern even if it is not found, which can lead to a significant performance degradation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more efficient regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the `regex` module in Node.js.
2. Avoid using possessive quantifiers and backtracking in regular expressions.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm, such as the `String.prototype.includes()` method, to check for the presence of a substring. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
An application uses a variable that has been declared by an external source, such as a user or another application, without proper validation, leading to a potential security vulnerability.
