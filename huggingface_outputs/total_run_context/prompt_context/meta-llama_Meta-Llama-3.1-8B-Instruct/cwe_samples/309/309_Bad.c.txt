 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-309 because it uses a password system as the primary means of authentication. The use of SHA1 hashing is also a concern as it is not considered secure for password storage. The code also does not handle cases where the password is empty or null, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the code does not check for buffer overflows when calling the simple_digest function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure hashing algorithm such as Argon2 or PBKDF2.
2. Store the hashed password securely, such as in a database with proper access controls.
3. Check for empty or null passwords before attempting to hash them.
4. Use a secure function to hash the password, such as OpenSSL's EVP_Digest function.
5. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect.
