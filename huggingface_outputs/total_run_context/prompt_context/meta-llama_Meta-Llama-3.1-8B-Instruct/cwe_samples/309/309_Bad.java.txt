 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-309 because it uses SHA hashing for password authentication. SHA hashing is not suitable for password storage due to its lack of salt and the use of a fixed-size output. This makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks and brute-force attacks. Additionally, the code does not use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. Use a salt value to prevent rainbow table attacks.
3. Use a sufficient work factor to slow down the hashing process and make it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
4. Consider using a library like Java's PasswordHasher or a third-party library like BCrypt to handle password hashing securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code of an application does not properly validate user input for security.
