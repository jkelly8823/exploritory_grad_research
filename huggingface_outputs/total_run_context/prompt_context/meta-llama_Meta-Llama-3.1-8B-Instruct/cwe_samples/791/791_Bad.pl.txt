 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The GetUntrustedInput function is used to retrieve user input, which is then used to construct a file path. The regular expression used to clean the input does not remove all special characters, allowing an attacker to manipulate the file path and potentially access sensitive files. This is a classic example of a CWE-791 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input, only allowing specific characters in the input.
2. Use a library like Path::Class to safely construct file paths.
3. Consider using a more robust input validation library like HTML::FormHandler. 
4. Always validate user input before using it to construct file paths or perform other sensitive operations. 
5. Consider using a sandboxed environment to execute user-supplied code. 
6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 
7. Consider using a security-focused framework like Catalyst or Mojolicious to help prevent common web application vulnerabilities. 
8. Always follow secure coding practices and guidelines, such as those provided by OWASP. 
9. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential
