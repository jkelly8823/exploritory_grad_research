 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow because it does not check if the dst_index is within the bounds of the allocated buffer before writing to it. This can lead to a write past the end of the buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to copy the string, such as using `strncpy` or `memcpy` to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Always check the bounds of the buffer before writing to it to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a more secure method to allocate memory, such as using `malloc` with a size that is a multiple of the size of the largest object that will be stored in the buffer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is declared by another module and might be used by that module before it is initialized, leading to undefined behavior.

Code Sample:

                  int x = 0;void foo() {int x;printf("%d", x);}void bar() {printf("%d", x);}
