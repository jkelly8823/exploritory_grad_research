 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of `memcpy` with a size parameter that is calculated by `returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1`. This can lead to writing data beyond the end of the destination buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow. The `returnChunkSize` function is not shown, but based on its name, it likely returns the size of the usable memory in the buffer. Subtracting 1 from this value may result in an index that is out of bounds for the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the `returnChunkSize` function to ensure it correctly calculates the size of the usable memory in the buffer.
2. Use a safer function like `memcpy_s` or `strncpy` to copy data into the destination buffer, and ensure the size parameter is correctly calculated to avoid buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a memory debugging tool to detect and prevent buffer overflows in the code.
