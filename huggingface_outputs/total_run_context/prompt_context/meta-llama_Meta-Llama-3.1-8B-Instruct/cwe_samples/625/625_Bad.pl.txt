 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression /\d+-\d+/ does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values. This is because it only checks for the presence of hyphens and digits, but does not account for other possible characters that could be present in a phone number. For example, a phone number could contain a plus sign (+) or a space, which would not be matched by this regular expression. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious input and bypass the intended validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust regular expression that accounts for all possible characters in a phone number, such as /\d+-\s*/.
2. Consider using a dedicated phone number validation library to handle this task, as it would be more reliable and efficient. 
3. Always validate user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. 
4. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate phone numbers, where only known valid formats are accepted. 5. Regularly review and update the regular expression to ensure it remains effective against new types of malicious input. 6. Consider using a more secure way to handle the system call, such as using a secure function or a library that handles
