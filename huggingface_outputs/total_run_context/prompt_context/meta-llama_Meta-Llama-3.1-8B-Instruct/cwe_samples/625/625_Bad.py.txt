 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the validate_ip_regex function does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values. The regular expression allows for IP addresses with leading zeros, which is not a valid IP address. For example, "012.34.56.78" is a valid match according to the current regular expression, but it is not a valid IP address.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The regular expression should be updated to not allow IP addresses with leading zeros. This can be achieved by adding a negative lookahead assertion to the regular expression to check that the first character of each octet is not a zero. The updated regular expression would be: r"((?!0)(25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}". This will ensure that only valid IP addresses are matched. Additionally, it's recommended to add input validation to ensure that the IP address is not too long or too short.
