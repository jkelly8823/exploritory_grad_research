 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user-controlled input into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input. The use of Hibernate's createQuery method does not provide any protection against SQL injection in this case.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can be achieved by using Hibernate's createQuery method with named or positional parameters.
2. Use the @Param annotation to specify the parameter names and types in the query.
3. Use the setParameter method to set the parameter values before executing the query. For example:
```java
String street = getStreetFromUser();
Query query = session.createQuery("from Address a where a.street = :street");
query.setParameter("street", street);
``` 
4. Consider using Hibernate's Criteria API or QueryDSL to build queries in a more type-safe and secure way. 
5. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential security issues. 
6. Regularly review and update your code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security best practices. 
7. Consider using
