 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1335 because the function choose_bit() performs a left shift operation on the variable reg_bit with a negative value. This can cause an unexpected or indeterminate result.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the choose_bit() function to ensure that the bit_number_from_elsewhere is not negative.
2. Use a safe left shift operation by using the bitwise AND operator (&) to ensure that the shift amount is within the valid range.
3. Consider using a safer method to perform the left shift operation, such as using the std::shift_left() function in C++ or a similar function in other languages. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The code does not properly handle the case where the input to the choose_bit() function is a negative number, leading to undefined behavior.

Code Sample:

					  int choose_bit(int reg_bit, int bit_number_from_elsewhere) 
					  {
					  
					    if (NEED_TO_SHIFT)
					    {
					    
					      reg_bit -= bit_number_from_elsewhere;
					    
					    }
					    return reg_bit;
