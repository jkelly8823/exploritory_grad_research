 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to shift the value 1 to the left by -5 bits. This is a negative shift amount, which is undefined behavior in C. The result of this operation is indeterminate and may cause unexpected results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, ensure that the shift amount is non-negative. If the shift amount is intended to be negative, consider using a different approach, such as using a different data type or a conditional statement to handle the negative case. For example, you could use a conditional statement to check if the shift amount is negative and handle it accordingly.
