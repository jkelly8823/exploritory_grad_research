 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-20 because it does not validate the input for the list size. Although it checks if the list size is negative, it does not check if the list size is too large. This could potentially lead to an OutOfMemoryError if the list size is too large. Additionally, the code does not check if the list size is a valid integer, which could lead to a ClassCastException if the list size is not an integer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the list size to ensure it is a positive integer and not too large to prevent an OutOfMemoryError.
2. Check if the list size is a valid integer to prevent a ClassCastException.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a LinkedList, to prevent memory issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

Code Sample:

                  private void buildList ( int untrustedListSize ){if (
