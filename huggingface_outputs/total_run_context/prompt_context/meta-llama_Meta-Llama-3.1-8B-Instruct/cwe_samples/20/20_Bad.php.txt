 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability. The code does not validate the input from the 'birthday' and 'homepage' GET parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input, potentially leading to security issues such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input from the 'birthday' and 'homepage' GET parameters using a whitelist approach or a library like PHP's filter_var function.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Use HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks. For example, use the htmlspecialchars function to escape the 'homepage' input before displaying it in the HTML output. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
