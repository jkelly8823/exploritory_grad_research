 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-20 because it does not validate the length of the URL before processing it. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow attack if a malicious user were to send a URL with a large length.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a library like Apache Commons Lang to validate the length of the URL.
2. Use a regular expression to validate the format of the URL.
3. Use a URL validation library like URLValidator to validate the URL. 
4. Implement a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions that may occur when processing the URL. 
5. Consider using a more secure way to handle URLs, such as using a URL parsing library like Uri.
