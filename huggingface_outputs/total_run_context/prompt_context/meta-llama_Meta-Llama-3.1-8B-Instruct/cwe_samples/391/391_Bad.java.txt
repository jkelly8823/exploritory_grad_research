 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-391 because it catches a specific exception (RareException) and ignores it. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the exception is thrown, as the code does not handle it properly. The comment "this can never happen" suggests that the developer believes this exception will never be thrown, but this is not a reliable way to handle exceptions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the catch block and let the exception propagate up the call stack, allowing it to be handled by a higher-level exception handler.
2. If the exception is expected to be rare, consider logging the exception and continuing with the program, rather than ignoring it.
3. Consider using a more general exception handler to catch and handle unexpected exceptions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 120
CWE Description:
[PLANNED FOR DEPRECATION. SEE MAINTENANCE NOTES AND CONSIDER CWE-252, CWE-248, OR CWE-1069.] Ignoring exceptions and other error conditions may allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior unnoticed.

Code Sample:

                  try {doExchange();}catch (Exception e) {
