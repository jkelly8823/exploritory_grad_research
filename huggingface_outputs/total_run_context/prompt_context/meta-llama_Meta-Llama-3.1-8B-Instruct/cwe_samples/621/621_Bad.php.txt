 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-621 because it uses external input to determine the names of variables into which information is extracted. The extract() function is used to extract variables from the $_POST array, which can lead to overwriting unintended variables. This is a serious vulnerability because it can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the extract() function, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities. Instead, use the $_POST array directly to access the variables.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the variables that are extracted from the $_POST array. This can be done by checking the variable names against a predefined list of allowed variables.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle user input, such as using prepared statements or parameterized queries. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks and other types of vulnerabilities.
