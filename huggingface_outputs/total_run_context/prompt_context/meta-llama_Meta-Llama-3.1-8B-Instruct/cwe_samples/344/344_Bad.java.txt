 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-344 because it uses a hardcoded password "Mew!" which is not suitable for production environments. This hardcoded password can be easily discovered by an attacker, allowing them to bypass the authentication mechanism. In a real-world scenario, passwords should be stored securely, such as hashed and salted, and compared against a stored hash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store the password securely, such as hashing and salting it.
2. Compare the input password against the stored hash instead of the hardcoded value.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

                int VerifyAdmin(String password) {int adminLevel = 0;if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {adminLevel = 1;}//Diagnostic Modereturn(adminLevel);}
