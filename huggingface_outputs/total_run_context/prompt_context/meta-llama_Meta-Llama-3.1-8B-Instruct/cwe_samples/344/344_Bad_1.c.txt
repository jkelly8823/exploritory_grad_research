 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The function pointer pt2Function is assigned a memory address, and then the function is called with three arguments. However, the function pointer is not checked for null before being called, which can lead to a segmentation fault. Moreover, the function pointer is assigned a hardcoded memory address, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the function pointer for null before calling it to prevent segmentation faults.
2. Use a safer way to assign the function pointer, such as using a function pointer array or a function pointer map.
3. Use a secure way to call the function, such as using a function pointer with a secure calling convention, such as __fastcall or __stdcall. 
4. Consider using a safer way to pass arguments to the function, such as using a struct or a class to encapsulate the arguments. 
5. Consider using a secure coding library or framework to help prevent format string vulnerabilities. 6. Consider using a code analysis tool to detect and prevent format string vulnerabilities. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard to ensure that all code is written
