 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-344 because the hardcoded password "Mew!" is used in the VerifyAdmin function. This hardcoded password can be easily discovered by an attacker, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the system. The password should be varied across different environments to prevent this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the password, such as a database or environment variable.
2. Use a secure method to compare the input password with the stored password, such as using a secure hash function.
3. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords directly in the code. Instead, consider using a configuration file or a secrets management system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program does not free a resource that it allocated.

Code Sample:

                int main() {
                        char *str = malloc(10);
                        strcpy(str, "Hello, World!");
                        printf("%s\n", str);
                        return 0;
                }
