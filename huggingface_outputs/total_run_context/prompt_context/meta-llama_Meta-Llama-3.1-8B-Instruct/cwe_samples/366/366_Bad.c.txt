 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-366 because it uses a static variable 'counter' in the function'storenum' which is not thread-safe. The 'counter' variable is incremented in each call to'storenum', and its value is used to update the 'foo' variable. If multiple threads call'storenum' simultaneously, the 'counter' variable may be incremented multiple times before its value is used to update 'foo', leading to incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use a thread-safe approach such as using a lock or an atomic variable to protect access to the 'counter' variable. Alternatively, you can use a thread-local variable to ensure that each thread has its own 'counter' variable. For example, you can use the 'thread_local' keyword in C++ to declare the 'counter' variable as thread-local. Here is an example of how you can modify the code to use a thread-local variable: 
```c
thread_local int counter = 0;
``` 
This will ensure that each thread has its own 'counter' variable, and the code will be thread-safe.
