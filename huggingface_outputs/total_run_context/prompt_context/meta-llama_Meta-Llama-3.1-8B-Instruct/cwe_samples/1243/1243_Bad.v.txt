 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to access to security-sensitive information stored in fuses not being limited during debug. This is because the key values are being assigned directly to the key_big variables when debug_mode_i is true. This allows an attacker to access the key values during debug mode, potentially compromising the security of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to limit access to security-sensitive information during debug mode, such as using a secure key storage mechanism or encrypting the key values.
2. Remove the direct assignment of key values to the key_big variables when debug_mode_i is true, and instead use a secure method to retrieve the key values.
3. Consider using a secure debug mode that does not allow access to sensitive information, or use a secure key storage mechanism that is not accessible during debug mode.
