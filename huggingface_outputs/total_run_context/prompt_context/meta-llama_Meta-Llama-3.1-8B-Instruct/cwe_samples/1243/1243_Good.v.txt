 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to access to security-sensitive information stored in fuses not being limited during debug. This is because the key values are being assigned to key_big0, key_big1, and key_big2 based on the debug_mode_i condition. When debug_mode_i is true, the key values are set to 192'b0, which is not a secure default value. This allows an attacker to access the key values during debug mode, potentially compromising the security of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure default value for the key values when debug_mode_i is true. For example, you can use a random value or a value that is not easily guessable.
2. Consider using a secure method to store and retrieve the key values, such as using a secure storage mechanism or encrypting the key values.
3. Ensure that the key values are not accessible during debug mode. You can do this by removing the assignments to key_big0, key_big1, and key_big2 when debug_mode_i is true, or by using a secure method to mask the key values during debug mode.
