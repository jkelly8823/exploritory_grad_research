 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the lack of proper synchronization when checking the file ownership and accessing the file. The `is_link()` function is used to resolve the symbolic link, but it does not prevent the file from being replaced with a link before the access is performed. This can lead to the product accessing the wrong file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock file mechanism to synchronize access to the file, ensuring that the file is not replaced with a link before the access is performed.
2. Use a more robust method to check the file ownership, such as using the `fileperms()` function to check the file permissions.
3. Consider using a more secure method to access the file, such as using a file descriptor or a secure file access library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate the format of input before using it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

                  function getCurrentUser(){
                        $user = $_SESSION['user'];
                        return $user;
                     }
