 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-820 because it uses a shared resource (stdout) in a concurrent manner without synchronizing access to it. In this case, the shared resource is the stdout stream, which is being accessed by both the parent and child processes. The use of fflush(stdout) and sleep(1) does not provide sufficient synchronization, as it only ensures that the parent process will not overwrite the child's output, but it does not prevent the child process from overwriting the parent's output. This can lead to data corruption and other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use synchronization primitives such as mutexes or locks to ensure that only one process can access the stdout stream at a time. For example, you can use the pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock functions to lock the stdout stream before accessing it. Alternatively, you can use a thread-safe function such as printf to print the output. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int main(void) {
                        int x;
