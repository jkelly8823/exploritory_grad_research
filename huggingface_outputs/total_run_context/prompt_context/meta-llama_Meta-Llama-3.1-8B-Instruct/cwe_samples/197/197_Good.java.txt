 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to truncation errors due to the casting of integers to shorts. The productCount and amountSold variables are being cast to shorts without checking if they are within the range of shorts. If the values are greater than the maximum value for shorts, they will be truncated, resulting in incorrect data being written to the sales database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the productCount and amountSold variables are within the range of shorts before casting them. This can be done by checking if they are less than Short.MAX_VALUE.
2. Consider using a larger data type, such as int or long, to store the productCount and amountSold variables to avoid truncation errors.
3. Use a try-catch block to catch any ArithmeticException that may be thrown when casting the variables to shorts. This will prevent the program from crashing and provide a more robust solution.
