 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to truncation errors due to the casting of the intPrimitive to shortPrimitive. The intPrimitive is assigned the maximum value of an int, which is then cast to a short. This can result in data loss and truncation errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to avoid casting the intPrimitive to shortPrimitive. Instead, the code can use a different approach to determine the maximum value of a short. For example, the code can use the expression (short)~0 to get the maximum value of a short. This approach avoids the truncation error and ensures that the correct maximum value is obtained. The corrected code would be:

int intPrimitive;short shortPrimitive;intPrimitive = (int)(~((int)0) ^ (1 << (sizeof(int)*8-1)));shortPrimitive = (short)~0;printf("Int MAXINT: %d\nShort MAXINT: %d\n", intPrimitive, shortPrimitive);
