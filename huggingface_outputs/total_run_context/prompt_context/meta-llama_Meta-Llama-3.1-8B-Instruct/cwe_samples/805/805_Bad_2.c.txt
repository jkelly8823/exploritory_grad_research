 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it uses the sizeof operator to determine the length of the source buffer, which includes the null terminator. However, the strncpy function does not include the null terminator in its count, resulting in a potential buffer overflow when writing to the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the strlen function to get the length of the source buffer, excluding the null terminator, and pass that value to the strncpy function. Alternatively, use the strlcpy function, which is designed to prevent buffer overflows. For example: char dest[12];strlcpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest)); or char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, strlen(source));. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable-length array (VLA) that is not properly initialized, leading to undefined behavior.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {   int n = 10;   int arr[n];   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {       arr[i] = i;   }   return 0;}
