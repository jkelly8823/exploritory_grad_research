 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the strncpy function is used with an incorrect length value. The sizeof(dest)-1 is used as the length, but this does not account for the null terminator that will be added to the destination buffer. This can cause the function to write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer function like strcpy_s or strncpy_s that takes the maximum number of characters to copy as an argument, and use that value instead of sizeof(dest)-1. Alternatively, use a safer function like strcpy or strncpy that does not have a length argument, but be aware that these functions do not prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for the existence of a file before attempting to open it.

Code Sample:

                 ...FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");...
