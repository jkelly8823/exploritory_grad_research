 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the incorrect length value used in the memcpy function. The returnChunkSize function returns the size of usable memory, but the memcpy function is called with the size minus one, which can cause it to access memory outside of the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the return statement in the returnChunkSize function to return the correct size of the buffer.
2. Use a safer function like strncpy or strcpy to copy the data, and ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data.
3. Consider using a memory-safe function like memcpy_s to copy the data, which can help prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable-length array (VLA) that is not properly initialized, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    int arr[n]; // VLA
    for (int i = 0; i
