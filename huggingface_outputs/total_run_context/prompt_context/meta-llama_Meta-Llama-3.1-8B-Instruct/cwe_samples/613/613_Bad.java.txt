 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The session-timeout element is set to -1, which means that the session will never expire. This allows an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization, making it vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Set the session-timeout element to a reasonable value, such as 30 minutes or 1 hour, to ensure that sessions expire after a certain period of inactivity. This will prevent attackers from reusing old session credentials or session IDs. For example:
<session-config><session-timeout>30</session-timeout></session-config>
