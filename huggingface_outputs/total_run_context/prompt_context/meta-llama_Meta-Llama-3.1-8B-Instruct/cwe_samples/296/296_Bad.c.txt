 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-296, as it incorrectly follows the chain of trust for a certificate. The line `if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))` checks if the certificate is self-signed or if the verification result is OK, but it does not properly check the entire chain of trust. This can lead to incorrect trust of resources associated with the certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `X509_verify_cert` function to properly verify the certificate chain.
2. Check the entire chain of trust, not just the immediate certificate.
3. Consider using a more robust certificate verification library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not properly handle an error condition, leading to a potential resource leak or other unexpected behavior.

Code Sample:

                  if (SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) == NULL)
                  {
                     // handle error
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     // handle success
                  }
