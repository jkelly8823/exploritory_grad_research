 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of strcpy() function. The function does not perform any bounds checking and can write data beyond the end of the destination buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. The line where the vulnerability is present is where the strcpy() function is called, specifically on line 5. The variable &destBuf[idx] is a pointer to a memory location within the buffer, but the strcpy() function does not know the size of the buffer, and it can write data beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strncpy() or strcpy_s() that takes the size of the destination buffer as an argument, to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Always check the return value of the strstr() function to ensure that it found a match before attempting to access the memory location.
3. Use a memory debugger or a tool like AddressSanitizer to detect and prevent buffer overflows at runtime.
