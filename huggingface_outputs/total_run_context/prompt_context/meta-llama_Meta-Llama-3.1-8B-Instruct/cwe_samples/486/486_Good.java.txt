 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-486 because it compares classes by name using the `getClass()` method, which can lead to incorrect class usage when multiple classes have the same name. In this case, the code assumes that `inputClass` is an instance of `TrustedClass` solely based on the class name, which is not a reliable way to determine class identity.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `instanceof` operator to check if `inputClass` is an instance of `TrustedClass`, like this: `if (inputClass instanceof TrustedClass)`.
2. Consider using a more robust way to identify classes, such as using a class loader or a dependency injection framework. 
3. If the code is designed to work with multiple classes having the same name, consider using a more specific identifier, such as a unique identifier or a class hierarchy.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The product uses a fixed-length buffer to store data, but does not check for buffer overflows.

Code Sample:

                  byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
                  int bytesRead = reader.read
