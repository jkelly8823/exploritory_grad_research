 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-486 because it compares classes by name, which can cause it to use the wrong class when multiple classes can have the same name. This is because the equals method is comparing the class names of the objects, not their actual class types. This can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with classes that have the same name but are not the same class.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `instanceof` operator to check if the object is an instance of the same class before comparing the class names.
2. Use the `getClass()` method to get the class of the object and compare it with the class of the current object using the `equals()` method of the `Class` class.
3. Consider using the `Objects.equals()` method to compare the class names, which is a more robust way to compare objects.
