 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-486 because it uses the "==" operator to compare the classes of two objects. This can lead to incorrect results if multiple classes have the same name but are not the same class. A more robust way to compare classes is to use the "equals" method, which is designed for this purpose.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the "==" operator with the "equals" method to compare classes: `if (obj.getClass().equals(this.getClass())) {...}`
2. Consider using the "instanceof" operator to check if the object is an instance of the same class before comparing classes: `if (obj instanceof this.getClass()) {...}`. This can provide additional safety and prevent potential issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

                        // set the default configuration
                        this.config = new Config("default");
                       ...
                     }
