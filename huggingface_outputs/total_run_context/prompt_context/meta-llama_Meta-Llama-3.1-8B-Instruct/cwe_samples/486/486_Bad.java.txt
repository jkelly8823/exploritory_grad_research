 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-486 because it compares classes by name. This can lead to the use of the wrong class when multiple classes have the same name. In this case, the code assumes that the class name is "TrustedClassName", but it does not verify if the class is actually trusted. This can lead to a security vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the class name.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the instanceof operator to check if the class is an instance of the trusted class.
2. Use the getClass().getCanonicalName() method to get the fully qualified name of the class, which is more unique than the simple class name.
3. Use a whitelist of trusted classes to verify if the class is trusted before using it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20

                  String output = input.toUpperCase();
                  //...
