VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The `cPickle.loads()` function is used to deserialize the incoming data without sufficient verification. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the deserialized data contains malicious code. Additionally, the `base64.b64decode()` function is used to decode the base64-encoded token without checking if the input is valid, which can also lead to deserialization of untrusted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer deserialization method, such as `json.loads()` or `yaml.safe_load()`, which can help prevent arbitrary code execution.
2. Implement additional validation and verification of the incoming data, such as checking the format and structure of the data, to ensure it is valid and trustworthy.
3. Consider using a library like `hmac` to verify the authenticity of the token, rather than relying on a custom implementation. 
4. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the secret key, such as using a secure key store or environment variables. 
5. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, which can provide better security and
