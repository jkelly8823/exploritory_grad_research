EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data. Although the code explicitly throws an exception when attempting to deserialize the object, this does not prevent an attacker from attempting to deserialize the object. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input stream to bypass this check and deserialize the object, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. This is a classic example of a "defensive programming" approach, which is not sufficient to prevent deserialization attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure deserialization mechanism, such as Jackson's `ObjectMapper` with a `DeserializationConfig` that disables default typing and uses a `ObjectReader` to deserialize the object.
2. Validate the input stream before deserialization to ensure it is trustworthy.
3. Consider using a library like Apache Commons Lang's `SerializationUtils` to safely deserialize objects. 
4. If possible, avoid deserialization altogether by using other serialization mechanisms, such as JSON or XML. 
5. Regularly review and update the deserialization mechanism to ensure it remains secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 502 CWE Description: The product deserializes untrusted data
