 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weak password hashing mechanism. The MD5 hash function is considered insecure for password storage due to its fast computation time and the ability to be precomputed. Additionally, the code does not use a salt, which is a random value added to the password before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks. This makes it possible for an attacker to use precomputed tables of hashes to quickly determine the original password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. Use a salt value when hashing passwords. This can be done by generating a random salt and storing it along with the hashed password.
3. Consider using a library that handles password hashing for you, such as the `passlib` library in Python. This can simplify the process and ensure that the password hashing is done securely.
