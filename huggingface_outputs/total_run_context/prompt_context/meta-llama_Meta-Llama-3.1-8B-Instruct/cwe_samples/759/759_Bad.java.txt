VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weak password hashing mechanism. The use of SHA-1 hashing without a salt makes it susceptible to rainbow table attacks. An attacker can precompute a list of hashes for common passwords and then use these precomputed hashes to quickly identify the password. This is a significant security risk, especially for password storage.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a password hashing algorithm that is designed to be slow and computationally expensive, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt.
2. Use a salt value to make the hash unique for each user. This can be done by generating a random salt value for each user and storing it along with the hashed password.
3. Consider using a password hashing library that handles these details for you, such as the Java PasswordHasher library. 
4. Consider using a more secure password hashing algorithm like Argon2id, which is designed to be more secure than SHA-1. 
5. Consider using a password hashing library that can handle password stretching, such as the Java PasswordHasher library. 
6. Consider using a password hashing library that can handle password stretching and
