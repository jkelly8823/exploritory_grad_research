 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weak password hashing mechanism. The use of MD5 hashing without a salt makes it susceptible to rainbow table attacks. Additionally, the hardcoded salt value 'SaltGoesHere' is not suitable for production use as it can be easily guessed or obtained by an attacker. A more secure approach would be to use a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace MD5 hashing with a more secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. Use a randomly generated salt value for each password, and store it alongside the hashed password.
3. Consider using a library like passlib or cryptography to handle password hashing and verification. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product uses a hard-coded value for a password or other sensitive information.

Code Sample:

                  def getAdminPassword():return 'admin123'
