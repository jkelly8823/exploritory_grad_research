 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weak password hashing mechanism. The use of SHA-1 hashing without a salt makes it susceptible to rainbow table attacks. An attacker can precompute a list of hashes for common passwords and then use these precomputed hashes to quickly identify the password. This is a significant security risk, especially for password-based authentication systems.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a password hashing algorithm that is designed to be slow and computationally expensive, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt.
2. Use a salt value to make the hash unique for each user. This can be done by generating a random salt for each user and storing it along with the hashed password.
3. Consider using a password hashing library that provides a secure and efficient way to hash passwords, such as OpenSSL or a dedicated password hashing library. 
4. Regularly update the password hashing algorithm to stay ahead of potential attacks. 
5. Consider implementing a password policy that requires strong and unique passwords for all users.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 20 CWE Description: The product uses a static string as a password. Code Sample: char
