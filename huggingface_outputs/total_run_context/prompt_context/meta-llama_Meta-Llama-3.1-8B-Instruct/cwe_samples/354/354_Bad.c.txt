 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code does not validate the integrity of the received message. The integrity check is performed by comparing the IP address of the client with a hardcoded value. This is not a reliable method for validating the integrity of the message. The code should use a secure method such as digital signatures or message authentication codes to validate the integrity of the message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method such as digital signatures or message authentication codes to validate the integrity of the message.
2. Remove the hardcoded IP address and use a more secure method to identify the client.
3. Consider using a secure protocol such as TLS to encrypt the message and provide integrity protection.
