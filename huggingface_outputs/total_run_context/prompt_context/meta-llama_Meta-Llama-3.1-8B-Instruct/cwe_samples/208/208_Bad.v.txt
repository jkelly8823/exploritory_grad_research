 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a for loop that iterates over the entered password and compares it to the golden password. The comparison is done using the eq operator, which is a blocking assignment. This means that the comparison will take some time to complete, and the result will be available only after the comparison is done. An attacker can exploit this by measuring the time it takes for the system to respond to different password inputs, and use this information to deduce the correct password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a non-blocking assignment (e.g. <=) instead of a blocking assignment (e.g. =) for the comparison.
2. Use a constant time comparison function that takes the same amount of time to complete regardless of the input.
3. Consider using a hardware-based solution, such as a secure coprocessor, to perform the password comparison.
