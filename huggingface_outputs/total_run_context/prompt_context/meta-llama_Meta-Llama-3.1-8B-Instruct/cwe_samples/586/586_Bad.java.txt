 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code explicitly calls the finalize() method on the widget object, which is a direct call from outside the finalizer. This is a potential vulnerability as it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes. The finalize() method is typically called by the garbage collector to free up resources, and calling it manually can interfere with the garbage collection process.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the explicit call to finalize() and let the garbage collector handle it. If necessary, override the finalize() method to perform any necessary cleanup, but do not call it manually.
