VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `getMessage` is called with a buffer size of `BUFFER_SIZE` but the buffer is not checked for its actual size before being used. This allows an attacker to send a message larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` which can cause the buffer to overflow and potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the actual size of the buffer before using it.
2. Use a safer function to read from the socket, such as `recv` which allows you to specify the maximum amount of data to read.
3. Consider using a safer function to process the message, such as `strncpy` which can prevent buffer overflows. 
4. Consider using a safer function to recast the buffer, such as `memcpy` which can prevent buffer overflows. 
5. Consider using a safer function to process the message, such as `strncpy` which can prevent buffer overflows. 
6. Consider using a safer function to process the message, such as `strncpy` which can prevent buffer overflows. 
7. Consider using a safer function to process the message, such
