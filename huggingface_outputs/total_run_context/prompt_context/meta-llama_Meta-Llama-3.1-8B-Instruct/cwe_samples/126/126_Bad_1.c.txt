 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to off-by-one buffer overflow attacks. The strncpy function does not null-terminate the string if the source string is longer than the destination buffer. This can cause the program to write beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. The code does not check the length of the source string before copying it to the destination buffer, making it vulnerable to off-by-one overflow attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the safer version of the strncpy function, strncpy_s, which checks for buffer overflow and null-terminates the string.
2. Use the strlcpy function, which is designed to prevent buffer overflows by checking the length of the source string before copying it to the destination buffer.
3. Use the fgets function to read the filename and pattern from the user, which will prevent buffer overflows by limiting the amount of input data. 
4. Use the sscanf function to parse the input string, which will prevent buffer overflows by limiting the amount of input data. 
5. Use the getline function to read the filename and pattern from the user, which will prevent buffer overflows by limiting the amount
