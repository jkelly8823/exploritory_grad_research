 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-790 vulnerability because it directly incorporates user input into a file path without proper sanitization. The line `$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;` attempts to remove consecutive dots from the input, but this is insufficient to prevent directory traversal attacks. An attacker could manipulate the input to access files outside the intended directory. The `ReadAndSendFile($filename);` line then reads and sends the file, potentially exposing sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to construct the file path, such as using a library that properly sanitizes user input.
2. Validate and sanitize the user input before incorporating it into the file path.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed characters in the file path. 
4. Avoid using regular expressions to sanitize user input, as they can be complex and error-prone. Instead, use a library or function specifically designed for input validation and sanitization. 
5. Consider using a secure file access library that can handle user input securely. 
6. Implement proper error handling to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur during file access. 7. Regularly
