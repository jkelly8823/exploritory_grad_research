 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-754 because it does not check for the existence of the file before attempting to read it. The `readFromFile()` method creates a `FileReader` object from the `readFile` object without checking if the file exists. This can lead to a `FileNotFoundException` being thrown, which is caught and handled, but it does not prevent the potential issue. A more robust approach would be to check if the file exists before attempting to read it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure the file exists before attempting to read it. This can be done by using the `File.exists()` method.
2. Consider using a try-with-resources statement to ensure the `FileReader` object is properly closed, even if an exception is thrown. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not check for or incorrectly checks for the existence of a resource before using it.

Code Sample:

public void readFromFile() {
    try {
        reader = new FileReader(readFile);
        // read input file
    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}
}
