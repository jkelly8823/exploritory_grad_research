 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-754 because it does not check for the case where the file does not exist, but instead catches the FileNotFoundException. However, it does check for the case where the inputFile has not been set, which is a good practice. However, it does not check for the case where the file is not a valid file, which could lead to a NullPointerException when trying to create a FileReader object. This is a potential vulnerability because it could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to see if the file exists before trying to create a FileReader object.
2. Consider using a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the FileReader object is properly closed.
3. Consider using a more robust way to handle the case where the inputFile has not been set, such as throwing a custom exception. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not check for or incorrectly checks for the existence of a resource before using it.

Code Sample:

                  public void readFromFile() {
                        try {
                              reader = new FileReader(readFile);
                              // read input file
                              //...
