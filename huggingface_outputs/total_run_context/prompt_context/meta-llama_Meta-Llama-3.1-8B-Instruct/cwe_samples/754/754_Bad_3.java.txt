 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-754 because it does not handle the case where the operating system is not Windows 95. The code checks for "Windows 95" but does not account for other possible values of "os.name" that may be returned by the System.getProperty() method. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the code is run on a different operating system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to determine the operating system, such as using the os.name property to check for a more general Windows operating system.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any unexpected values of "os.name" that may be returned. 
3. If the code is intended to only run on Windows 95, consider using a more explicit check, such as checking the os.version property, to ensure that the code is only run on the intended operating system.
