 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-754 because it does not check for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product. In this case, the code does not check if the file exists before attempting to read it, and it does not handle the case where the file is larger than 1k bytes. This can lead to a FileNotFoundException or an IOException if the file does not exist or is larger than expected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the file exists before attempting to read it.
2. Handle the case where the file is larger than 1k bytes by increasing the buffer size or using a more efficient method to read the file.
3. Consider using a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the FileInputStream. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
