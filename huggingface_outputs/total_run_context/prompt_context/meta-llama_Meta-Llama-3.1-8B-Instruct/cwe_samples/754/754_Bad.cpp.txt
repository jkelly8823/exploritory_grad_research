EXPLANATION:
The function outputStringToFile does not check if the file was successfully opened before attempting to write to it. This could lead to a situation where the function attempts to write to a file that does not exist, resulting in an error. This is an example of CWE-754, where the function does not check for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of openFileToWrite to ensure the file was successfully opened before attempting to write to it.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any potential errors that may occur when writing to the file.
