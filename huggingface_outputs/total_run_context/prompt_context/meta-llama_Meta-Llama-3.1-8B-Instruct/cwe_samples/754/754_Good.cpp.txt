 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check for the return value of the openFileToWrite function. If the function fails to open the file, the code will continue to execute and attempt to write to the file, which may result in data loss or corruption. The code also does not check for the return value of the closeFile function. If the function fails to close the file, the file may remain open, leading to resource leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of the openFileToWrite function and handle the error accordingly.
2. Check the return value of the closeFile function and handle the error accordingly.
3. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during file operations.
