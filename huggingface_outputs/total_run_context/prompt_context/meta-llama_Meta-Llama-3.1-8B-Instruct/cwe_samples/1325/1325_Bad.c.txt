 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1325 because it dynamically allocates memory on the stack using alloca() for each object in the database. This can lead to a large amount of memory being consumed by the combined objects, potentially causing a stack overflow. The alloca() function allocates memory on the stack, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a fixed-size buffer or array to store the objects, instead of dynamically allocating memory on the stack.
2. Consider using a heap-based allocation function, such as malloc(), to allocate memory for the objects.
3. Implement a mechanism to limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by the combined objects, such as a memory pool or a limit on the number of objects that can be stored.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 1325 CWE Description: The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.
