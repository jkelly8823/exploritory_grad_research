 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-761 because it calls free() on a pointer to a memory resource that was allocated on the heap, but the pointer is not at the start of the buffer. In this case, the pointer is being incremented inside the while loop, which means that the free() function is being called on a pointer that is not the original pointer returned by malloc(). This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a pointer to the start of the buffer instead of incrementing the pointer inside the loop. This can be achieved by using a separate pointer to keep track of the current position in the string.
2. Use a loop that does not modify the pointer, such as a for loop, to iterate over the string.
3. Consider using a safer memory management function, such as realloc() or strdup(), to allocate and manage memory in the code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE-761: Free Result of Memory Allocation, CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.  CWE-119 is a secondary vulnerability that can occur if the buffer overflow
