EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-761 because it calls free() on a pointer to a memory resource that was allocated on the heap, but the pointer is not at the start of the buffer. In this case, the pointer is at the end of the buffer, which is the address of the last character in the string. This is because the input string is not null-terminated, and the strtok() function will continue to parse the string until it reaches the end of the buffer. When the loop finishes, the pointer to the last character in the string is passed to free(), which will attempt to free memory that is not allocated, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the input string is null-terminated before passing it to strtok().
2. Use a safer function like fgets() to read input from the user, which will automatically null-terminate the string.
3. Use a memory debugging tool like Valgrind to detect memory leaks and invalid memory access. 
4. Consider using a safer memory management function like realloc() to allocate memory for the command string. 
5. Always check the return value of malloc() to ensure that the
