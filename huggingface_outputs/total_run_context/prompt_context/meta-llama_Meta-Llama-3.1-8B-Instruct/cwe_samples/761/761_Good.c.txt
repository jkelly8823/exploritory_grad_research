EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-761 because it calls free() on a pointer to a memory resource that was allocated on the heap, but the pointer is not at the start of the buffer. In this case, the pointer is at the end of the buffer after the strcpy() function is called. This is because strcpy() copies the string "Search Me!" into the allocated memory, but it does not null-terminate the string. As a result, the pointer is pointing to the memory location after the string, which is not the start of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the strncpy() function instead of strcpy() to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use the fgets() function to read input from the user and prevent buffer overflow.
3. Check the return value of malloc() to ensure that the memory allocation was successful.
4. Use a loop to iterate over the string and check for the character, instead of using the strlen() function. This will prevent the code from accessing memory outside the allocated buffer. 
5. Use a more secure way to free the memory, such as using a smart pointer or a container class that manages the
