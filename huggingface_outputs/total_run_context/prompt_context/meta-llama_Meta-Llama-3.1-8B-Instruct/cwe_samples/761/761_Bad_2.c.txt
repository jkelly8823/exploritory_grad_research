 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-761 because it calls free() on a pointer to a memory resource that was allocated on the heap, but the pointer is not at the start of the buffer. In this case, the pointer is returned by the strtok() function, which can return a pointer to a substring within the original string. This can lead to a double-free vulnerability if the same memory location is freed again.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strtok_r() that allows you to keep track of the start of the buffer and avoid freeing the same memory location twice.
2. Alternatively, use a safer string parsing function like strtok_s() that is designed to handle this type of scenario. 
3. If possible, consider using a safer string parsing library like ICU or a similar library that is designed to handle complex string parsing scenarios. 
4. Always check the return value of malloc() and free() to ensure that the memory allocation was successful and that the memory was freed correctly. 
5. Consider using a memory debugging tool like Valgrind to detect memory-related issues like double-free vulnerabilities.  ```c
