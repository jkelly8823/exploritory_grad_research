 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-77 because it constructs a command using externally-influenced input from the user (arg1 and arg2) without properly sanitizing it. The format method is used to insert the user input into the prompt string, which can lead to a command injection vulnerability if the user input is not properly validated or sanitized. In this case, the code uses the invokeChatbot function to execute the command, which can lead to unintended behavior if the user input is malicious.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the user input (arg1 and arg2) before inserting it into the prompt string.
2. Use a safe method to construct the command, such as using a template engine or a parameterized query.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against command injection vulnerabilities.
