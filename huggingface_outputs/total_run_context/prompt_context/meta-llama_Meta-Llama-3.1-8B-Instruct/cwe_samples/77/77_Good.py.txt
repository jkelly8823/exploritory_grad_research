 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-77 because it uses the regular expression to search for the pattern in the input strings `arg1` and `arg2`. However, the regular expression is not properly sanitized, and an attacker could potentially inject malicious input that would modify the intended command. This could lead to unintended behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the input strings `arg1` and `arg2` before passing them to the regular expression.
2. Use a more robust regular expression that is less susceptible to injection attacks.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input strings instead of relying on a regular expression. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a SQL command without sufficient validation to handle SQL syntax correctly.

Code Sample:

				 
				   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}'".format(username)
				   cursor.execute(query)
