 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the line 1 is vulnerable to CWE-77. The regular expression is used to validate the input name. However, the regular expression does not properly sanitize the input, allowing for potential command injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious input that would be interpreted as a command, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more secure regular expression that properly sanitizes the input. For example, you can use the following regular expression: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\s]+$ to allow only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and spaces. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input, where you only allow specific characters or patterns that are known to be safe. This will help prevent potential command injection attacks.
