 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-77 because it constructs a command using externally-influenced input from the "backuptype" parameter without properly sanitizing it. The input is directly concatenated into the command string, which can lead to command injection attacks. The use of "cmd.exe /K" and the execution of the command using Runtime.getRuntime().exec() further exacerbates the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input from the "backuptype" parameter to ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a library like Apache Commons Lang to properly escape the input before concatenating it into the command string.
3. Consider using a more secure way to execute the command, such as using ProcessBuilder or a library like Java Exec. 
4. Remove the use of "cmd.exe /K" and instead use a more secure way to execute the command. 
5. Consider using a configuration file or a database to store the allowed commands and their parameters, rather than hardcoding them in the code. 6. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities. 7. Use a secure way to
