VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The variable $fname is not properly sanitized before being used in the system call. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the value of $fname. For example, if an attacker passes a value like "; rm -rf /" for $fname, the system call would execute the command "/bin/ls -l ; rm -rf /", which would delete the root directory. This is a classic example of a command injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input. In this case, you can check if the filename is within a specific directory or has a specific extension.
2. Use a library like Path::Class to handle file paths and avoid using system calls directly.
3. Use a safer way to execute commands, such as using a library like IPC::System::Simple.
4. Avoid using system calls with user input directly. Instead, use a safer way to execute commands, such as using a library like IPC::System::Simple.
