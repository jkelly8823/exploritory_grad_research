EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1285 because it does not validate the index provided by the user. The function GetUntrustedOffset() returns an untrusted offset which is then used to access the items array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access if the user provides an index that is less than 1 or greater than the size of the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the index provided by the user to ensure it is within the bounds of the array.
2. Use a safer function to get the index, such as using a loop to iterate over the array and get the index from the user.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a linked list or a dynamic array, that can handle out-of-bounds access more securely. 4. Use a secure function to access the array, such as using a bounds-checked function. 5. Consider using a safer language feature, such as a try-catch block, to handle the out-of-bounds access. 6. Use a secure library function to access the array, such as using a bounds-checked function. 7. Consider using a safer data
