 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1285 because it does not validate the index 'num' before using it to access the'sizes' array. The code checks if 'num' is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 'count', but it does not check if 'num' is within the bounds of the'sizes' array. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access if 'num' is greater than or equal to the size of the'sizes' array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that 'num' is within the bounds of the'sizes' array before accessing it. This can be done by checking if 'num' is less than the size of the'sizes' array.
2. Consider using a safer way to access the'sizes' array, such as using a pointer to the last element of the array and decrementing it to access the elements in reverse order. This can help prevent out-of-bounds access.
