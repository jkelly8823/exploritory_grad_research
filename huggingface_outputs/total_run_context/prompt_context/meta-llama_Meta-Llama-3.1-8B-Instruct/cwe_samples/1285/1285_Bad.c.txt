 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1285 because it does not validate the index 'num' before using it to access the'sizes' array. The 'num' variable is obtained from user input via the 'gen_recv' function, which can potentially return malicious data. If the 'num' value is out of bounds or negative, it can lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the 'num' value before using it to access the'sizes' array. This can be done by checking if 'num' is within the valid range of indices for the'sizes' array.
2. Consider using a safer function to read data from the socket, such as'recv' instead of 'gen_recv', which may not provide the same level of security guarantees.
3. Use a more secure method to parse the input data, such as using a dedicated parsing library or function, to reduce the risk of buffer overflows or other security issues.
