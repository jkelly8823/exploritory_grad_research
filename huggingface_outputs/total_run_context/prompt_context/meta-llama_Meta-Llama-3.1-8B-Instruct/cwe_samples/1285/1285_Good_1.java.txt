 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1285 because it does not validate the index before accessing the productArray. The index is directly passed from the user input without any validation. This can lead to an IndexOutOfBoundsException when the index is out of range.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the index before accessing the productArray. This can be done by checking if the index is within the bounds of the productArray.
2. Use a try-catch block to handle the IndexOutOfBoundsException and provide a meaningful error message to the user.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure such as a List with bounds checking to prevent IndexOutOfBoundsException. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

Code Sample:

                  int index = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("index"));...try {productSummary = (String) productArray.get(index);} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {...}
