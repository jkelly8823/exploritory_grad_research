 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-489 because it is deployed to an unauthorized actor (the user) with debugging code still enabled or active. The form is directly accessible to the user, and the action attribute of the form points to a CGI script that may contain debugging code or sensitive information. This could potentially create unintended entry points or expose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove or disable debugging code from the CGI script.
2. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the CGI script.
3. Use a secure protocol (e.g., HTTPS) to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server. 
4. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential attacks. 
5. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks. 6. Regularly review and update the CGI script to ensure it does not contain any sensitive information. 7. Consider using a secure coding practice such as secure coding guidelines to ensure the code is secure. 8. Implement a secure password policy to prevent weak passwords. 9. Consider using a secure authentication mechanism such as OAuth or OpenID Connect. 10. Regularly
