VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-350 because it performs reverse DNS resolution on an IP address to obtain the hostname and make a security decision, but it does not properly ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname. This can be exploited by an attacker to make the system trust a malicious host. The code uses the `gethostbyaddr` function to perform the reverse DNS resolution, which can return a hostname that is not associated with the IP address. The `strncmp` function is used to compare the obtained hostname with the expected hostname, but this comparison is not sufficient to ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to verify the hostname, such as using a DNSSEC-aware library or a trusted DNS server.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname, such as checking the IP address against a list of known trusted hosts.
3. Consider using a more secure method to obtain the hostname, such as using the `getaddrinfo` function instead of `gethostbyaddr`. 
4. Validate the input `ip_addr_string
