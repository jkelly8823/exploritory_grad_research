 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-350 because it relies on the result of reverse DNS resolution to make a security decision. However, the IP address may not be truly associated with the hostname, allowing an attacker to bypass security checks by spoofing the hostname. This is a classic example of a reverse DNS spoofing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of relying on reverse DNS resolution, use a trusted source to verify the IP address, such as a whitelist or a database of trusted IP addresses.
2. Implement a more robust security check that takes into account the IP address and the hostname, rather than relying solely on the result of reverse DNS resolution.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure way to perform reverse DNS resolution, such as the `java.net.InetAddress` class with the `getHostAddress()` method. This method returns the IP address associated with the hostname, rather than the hostname itself. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input without proper validation as part of its security decision.

Code Sample:
