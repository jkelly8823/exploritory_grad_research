 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-350 because it relies on the hostname of the IP address to make a security decision. However, the hostname can be spoofed by an attacker, allowing them to bypass the security check. This is because the code does not properly ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to verify the IP address, such as checking the IP address against a trusted list or using a secure protocol like DNSSEC.
2. Avoid relying solely on the hostname for security decisions, and instead use a combination of IP address and hostname checks.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure way to perform reverse DNS resolution. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input without proper validation as part of its internal logic flow, leading to a potential security vulnerability.

Code Sample:

                  string input = Console.ReadLine();if (input == "admin") {Console.WriteLine("Welcome, admin!");}else {Console.WriteLine("Invalid username or password.");}
