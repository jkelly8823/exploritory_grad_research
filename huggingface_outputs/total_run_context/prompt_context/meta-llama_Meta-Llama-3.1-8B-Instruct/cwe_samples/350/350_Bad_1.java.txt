 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-350 because it performs reverse DNS resolution on the IP address to obtain the hostname and make a security decision. However, it does not properly ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname. This can be exploited by an attacker to make the system perform actions based on a hostname that is not associated with the IP address.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist of trusted hostnames to ensure that only known and trusted hostnames are accepted.
2. Implement a mechanism to verify the association between the IP address and the hostname, such as using a DNS lookup or a database of known associations.
3. Avoid using the getHostName() method, which can be unreliable and vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks. Instead, use the getInetAddress() method to get the IP address and then perform a DNS lookup to get the hostname. This will ensure that the hostname is obtained from a trusted source.
