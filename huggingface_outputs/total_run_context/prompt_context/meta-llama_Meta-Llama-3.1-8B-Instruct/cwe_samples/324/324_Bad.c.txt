 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-324 because it does not check if the certificate has expired. Although it checks if the certificate is not yet valid (X509_V_ERRCERT_NOT_YET_VALID), it does not check if the certificate has expired (X509_V_ERRCERT_EXPIRED). This allows an attacker to use a certificate that has expired, which can lead to a timing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the certificate has expired by using the X509_V_ERRCERT_EXPIRED error code.
2. Use a more secure method to handle expired certificates, such as revoking them or not accepting them at all. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to verify the certificate, such as using a certificate validation library.  ```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERRCERT_NOT_YET_VALID==foo) || (X509_V_ERRCERT_EXPIRED==foo))
        //do stuff
}
```  ```c
