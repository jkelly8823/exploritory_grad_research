 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a non-blocking assignment in the always @ (posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) block. This can lead to a situation where the inputs are saved before the previous inputs have been fully processed, potentially causing the system to undermine security guarantees.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a blocking assignment instead of a non-blocking assignment to ensure that the inputs are saved after the previous inputs have been fully processed.
2. Consider using a FIFO or other synchronization mechanism to handle the inputs in a more robust way. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all critical sections are properly synchronized to prevent race conditions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 1298
CWE Description:
A race condition in the hardware logic results in undermining security guarantees of the system.  The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a non-blocking assignment in the always @ (posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) block. This can lead to a situation where the inputs are saved before the previous inputs have been fully processed, potentially causing the system to
