 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a non-blocking assignment (<=) in the always @ (posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) block. This can lead to a situation where the pmpaddr_reg and pmpcfg_reg are updated before the previous values are fully propagated, potentially causing a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use blocking assignments (=) instead of non-blocking assignments (<=) in the always @ (posedge clk_i or negedge rst_ni) block.
2. Consider using a single clock domain for all registers to avoid potential race conditions.
3. Use a synchronization mechanism, such as a FIFO or a handshake protocol, to ensure that the pmpaddr_reg and pmpcfg_reg are updated in a predictable and controlled manner.

CWE_ID: 1298
CWE Description:
A race condition in the hardware logic results in undermining security guarantees of the system.  The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a non-blocking assignment (<=) in the always @ (posedge clk_i or negedge rst
