 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the different responses it sends for different circumstances. In this case, the code prints "Login Successful" when the login is successful, "Login Failed - incorrect password" when the password is incorrect, and "Login Failed - unknown username" when the username is unknown. An attacker can exploit this by trying different usernames and passwords to determine whether the username exists or not, and whether the password is correct or not. This is a clear example of CWE-203.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of printing different messages for different circumstances, return a single success or failure status code. This will prevent the attacker from determining the state of the product.
2. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as hashing and salting passwords, to prevent password guessing attacks.
3. Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks. This can be done by limiting the number of login attempts within a certain time frame.
