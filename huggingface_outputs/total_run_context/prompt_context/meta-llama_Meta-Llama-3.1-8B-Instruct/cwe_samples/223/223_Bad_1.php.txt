 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-223 because it does not record or display information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe. Specifically, the code does not log the actual file path that was accessed, but instead logs the symbolic link path. This makes it difficult to determine the actual file that was accessed, which is crucial for identifying the source or nature of an attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Log the actual file path that was accessed, not the symbolic link path. This can be done by logging the value of $realFile instead of $filename.
2. Consider logging additional information such as the user's IP address, the time of access, and the type of access (read or write). This will provide more context and make it easier to identify the source or nature of an attack.
