 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code does not record or display information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe. Specifically, the code does not log failed login attempts when the number of attempts is less than 5. This makes it difficult to identify potential security threats and track user behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Modify the code to log failed login attempts regardless of the number of attempts. This can be achieved by moving the log statement outside the conditional statement.
2. Consider implementing a more robust logging mechanism that includes additional information such as IP address, user agent, and timestamp.
3. Regularly review and analyze the login logs to identify potential security threats and track user behavior.
