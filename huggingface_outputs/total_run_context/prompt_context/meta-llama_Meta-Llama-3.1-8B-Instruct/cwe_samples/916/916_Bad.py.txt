 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code uses MD5 hashing for password storage, which is considered insecure due to its low computational effort and vulnerability to brute-force attacks. CWE-916 is applicable here as the code does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort to make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. Consider using a library like passlib or cryptography to handle password hashing securely.
3. Update the code to use a salt value to prevent rainbow table attacks. 
4. Consider using a password hashing framework like Flask-Bcrypt or Django's built-in password hashing.  ```python
import hashlib
import os

def storePassword(userName, Password):
    # Generate a random salt value
    salt = os.urandom(16)
    
    # Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt
    import bcrypt
    hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashpw(Password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    
    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName, hashedPassword, salt)
```
