 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The code uses MD5 hashing, which is a weak hashing algorithm that can be easily cracked using brute-force attacks. This is because MD5 has a relatively low computational effort required to generate a hash, making it feasible for attackers to try all possible combinations of passwords. A more secure approach would be to use a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to password cracking attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace MD5 with a more secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. Use a salt value that is unique for each user, rather than a fixed salt value.
3. Consider using a library like passlib or cryptography to handle password hashing and verification. This can help ensure that the password hashing algorithm is used correctly and securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible
