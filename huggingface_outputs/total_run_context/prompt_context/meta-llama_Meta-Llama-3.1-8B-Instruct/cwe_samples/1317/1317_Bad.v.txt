 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1317 because the fabric bridge between the aes0_wrapper and clint modules does not perform the expected privilege, identity, or other access control checks. The assign statement at line 14 and 15 enables the en signal based on the en_acct and acct_ctrl_i signals, but it does not check if the user has the necessary privileges to access the IP blocks. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a privilege check to the assign statement to ensure that the user has the necessary privileges to access the IP blocks.
2. Use a secure fabric bridge that performs the expected privilege, identity, or other access control checks between the IP blocks. 
3. Consider using a secure communication protocol, such as AXI-SEC, to encrypt and authenticate the data transmitted between the IP blocks.  ```c
					assign en = en_acct && acct_ctrl_i && privilege_check();
					...
					function logic privilege_check();
						// Implement the privilege check logic here
					endfunction
					```
