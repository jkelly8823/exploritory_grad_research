 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The user input from the "reportName" parameter is directly used to construct the file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory, leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a validated and sanitized input for the "reportName" parameter to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a Path object to construct the file path, which can help prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Ensure that the file path is properly validated and sanitized before using it in filesystem operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + request.getParameter("username") + "'";Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
