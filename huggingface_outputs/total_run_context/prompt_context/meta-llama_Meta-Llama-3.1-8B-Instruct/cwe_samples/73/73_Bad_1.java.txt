VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The "sub" property is retrieved from a configuration file and used to construct a file path. An attacker could manipulate the "sub" property to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the "sub" property to ensure it only contains expected characters and does not contain any directory traversal sequences (e.g., "..", "/").
2. Use a secure method to read the file, such as using a try-with-resources statement to ensure the file is properly closed.
3. Consider using a more secure configuration file format, such as a properties file with a fixed set of allowed keys, to reduce the risk of configuration-based attacks. 4. Use a secure method to print the contents of the file, such as using a try-with-resources statement to ensure the file is properly closed. 5. Consider using a more secure way to read the file, such as using a library that can handle file paths securely. 6. Consider using a more secure way to print the contents of the file, such as using a library that can
