 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-453 because it initializes the $authorized variable with a default value of false, which is less secure than possible. This is because the variable is used to determine if the user is authorized, and setting it to false by default means that any user will be considered unauthorized until they successfully log in. This is less secure than possible because it allows an attacker to potentially exploit the system by attempting to log in with a malicious user name or password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the $authorized variable with a value of true by default, so that any user is considered authorized until they are explicitly denied access.
2. Use a more secure method to handle user authentication, such as using a secure password hashing algorithm and verifying the user's credentials against a secure database. 
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle user input, such as using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest security best practices.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 20 CWE Description: The product generates
