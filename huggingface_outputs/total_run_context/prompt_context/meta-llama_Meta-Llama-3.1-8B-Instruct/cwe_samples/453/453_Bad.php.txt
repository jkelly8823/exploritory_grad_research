 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes the $authorized variable with a default value of false, but then immediately sets it to true if the login_user function returns true. However, the login_user function is not shown in this code snippet, but it is possible that it does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to a vulnerability. Additionally, the $user and $pass variables are automatically set from a POST request, which could also be a potential vulnerability. The code does not check if the $user and $pass variables are empty or null before passing them to the login_user function, which could lead to a null pointer exception or other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the user input in the login_user function to prevent SQL injection or other attacks.
2. Check if the $user and $pass variables are not empty or null before passing them to the login_user function.
3. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to authenticate users, such as using a library or framework that handles authentication securely. 5. Consider adding error handling to the login_user function to handle any potential
