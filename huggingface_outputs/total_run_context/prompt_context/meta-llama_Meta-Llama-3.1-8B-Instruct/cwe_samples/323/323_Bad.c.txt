 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-323 because the nonce "bad" is hardcoded and reused. Nonces should be randomly generated for each encryption operation to prevent attacks such as replay attacks. Additionally, the code does not check for memory allocation failures, which can lead to a crash if the malloc calls fail.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Generate a random nonce for each encryption operation using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
2. Check the return values of the malloc calls to ensure that memory allocation was successful.
3. Use a secure method to generate the SHA1 hash, such as using a library that provides a secure implementation. 
4. Consider using a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, and a secure method to send the encrypted data. 
5. Consider using a secure method to handle the password, such as hashing and salting it before storing it.
