 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-323 because the nonce is not being used for the present occasion and only once. The nonce is being reused and concatenated with a secret password, which defeats the purpose of using a nonce. A nonce should be unique and unpredictable, and should not be reused or stored.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Generate a new nonce for each execution of the code.
2. Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator to generate the nonce.
3. Do not store or reuse the nonce.
4. Use a secure method to combine the nonce with the secret password, such as using a secure hash function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 327
CWE Description:
Inadequate encoding or escaping of user data can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

                  String username = request.getParameter("username");String password = request.getParameter("password");String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";Statement statement = connection.createStatement();ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
