EXPLANATION:
The variable price is declared as final, but it is not immutable. The method LookupPrice("MyWidgetType") can return a different value each time it is called, which can cause the price to change unexpectedly. This is a critical public variable that can be modified to contain unexpected values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Declare the price variable as private instead of public to limit access to it.
2. Use a constant or a final variable to store the price, and initialize it with the result of LookupPrice("MyWidgetType") in the constructor.
3. Consider using a more robust method to store and retrieve prices, such as a database or a configuration file.
