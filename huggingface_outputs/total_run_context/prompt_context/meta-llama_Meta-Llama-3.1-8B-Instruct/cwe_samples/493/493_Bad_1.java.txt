 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The variable "configPath" is declared as a public variable, which means it can be accessed and modified from outside the class. This is a potential security risk as it allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the variable to contain unexpected values. Additionally, the variable is not declared as final, which means it can be reassigned after it is initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Declare the variable as final to prevent it from being reassigned.
2. Consider declaring the variable as private to limit its accessibility.
3. Use a more secure method to store sensitive configuration data, such as using a secure configuration file or a secrets management system.
