 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The variable 'configPath' is declared as a public string, which means it can be accessed and modified from outside the class. This is a potential security risk as an attacker could modify the value of 'configPath' to point to a malicious file, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Declare the 'configPath' variable as private to restrict access to it.
2. Use a constructor or a setter method to initialize the 'configPath' variable, ensuring that it can only be set to a valid value.
3. Consider using a configuration file or a secure storage mechanism to store sensitive data, such as application configuration.
