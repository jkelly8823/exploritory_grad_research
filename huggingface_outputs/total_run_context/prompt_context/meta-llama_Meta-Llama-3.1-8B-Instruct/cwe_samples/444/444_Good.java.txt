 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-444 because it does not handle multiple Content-Length headers correctly. If a request contains multiple Content-Length headers, the code will output an error response. However, it does not handle this situation in a way that is consistent with how the ultimate destination will process the message. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the check for multiple Content-Length headers and handle the situation where multiple headers are present in a way that is consistent with the ultimate destination's behavior.
2. Consider using a more robust HTTP parsing library that can handle malformed requests correctly.
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior in case of an exception.
