VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `request.getParameter("reportName")` method retrieves user input from the request, which is then concatenated with a directory path. This allows an attacker to potentially access files outside of the intended directory by manipulating the input to include directory traversal sequences such as `../` or `/`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a validated and sanitized input mechanism to ensure that the `reportName` parameter only contains valid characters.
2. Use a `Path` object to construct the file path, which will prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to retrieve the file path, such as using a database or a configuration file. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a SQL command without sufficient validation to handle SQL syntax correctly.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
