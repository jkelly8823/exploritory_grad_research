 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-705 because it uses the http_redirect function to redirect the user to an error page. However, the http_redirect function is not a standard PHP function and may not work as expected in all scenarios. A more reliable way to redirect the user would be to use the header function to send a Location header. Additionally, the code does not properly return control flow to the proper location after it has completed a task or detected an unusual condition, which is a key characteristic of CWE-705.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the http_redirect function with the header function to send a Location header.
2. Use a more robust way to handle the error condition, such as throwing an exception or returning an error code.
3. Consider using a more secure way to store and retrieve the IP allow list, such as using a database or a secure storage mechanism.
