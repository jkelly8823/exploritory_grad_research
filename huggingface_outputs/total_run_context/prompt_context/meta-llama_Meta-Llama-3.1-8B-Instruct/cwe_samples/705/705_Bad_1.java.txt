 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-705 because it uses System.exit(1) in the catch block of the doPost method. This can cause the application to terminate abruptly without properly returning control flow to the caller, potentially leading to data loss or corruption. Additionally, the use of System.exit(1) can also mask underlying issues in the application, making it difficult to diagnose and debug.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace System.exit(1) with a more controlled way of handling the exception, such as logging the error and re-throwing the exception or returning an error response to the client.
2. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as a custom exception handler or a centralized error handling system, to handle unexpected exceptions and provide a more consistent user experience.
