 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-697 because it incorrectly compares the input username and password with the hardcoded values. The comparison is done using the strncmp function, which is incorrect because it compares the strings up to the length of the input string, not the hardcoded values. This can lead to incorrect authentication results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the correct comparison function, such as strcmp, which compares the strings up to the length of the hardcoded values.
2. Use a secure method to compare the input username and password, such as using a secure hash function or a password verification library.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect.
