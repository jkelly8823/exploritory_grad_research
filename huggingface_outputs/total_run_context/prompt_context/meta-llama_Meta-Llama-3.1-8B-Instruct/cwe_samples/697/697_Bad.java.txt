 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-14
EXPLANATION:
The equals method in the Truck class is vulnerable to CWE-697. The comparison is incorrect because it only checks for equality of the make and model fields, but not the year field. This may lead to unexpected behavior when comparing two Truck objects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the equals method to compare all relevant fields, including the year field.
2. Consider using the Objects.equals() method to simplify the comparison.
3. If the Truck class is part of a larger hierarchy, consider overriding the equals method in the superclass as well. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

                           public void deposit(double amount) {
                              if (amount < 0) {
                                 System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount: " + amount);
                              } else {
                                 // deposit logic
                              }
                           }
                     }
