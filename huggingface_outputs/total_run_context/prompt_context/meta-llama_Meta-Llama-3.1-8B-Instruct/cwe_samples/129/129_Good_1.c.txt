VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-129 because it uses untrusted input (the 'num' variable) to calculate an array index without proper validation. The 'num' variable is obtained from the'sscanf' function, which parses the input string 'buf' and stores the result in 'num'. However, if the input string 'buf' contains a malicious value, 'num' could be set to an invalid index, leading to an out-of-bounds access in the'sizes' array. The code attempts to validate 'num' by checking if it is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 'count', but this check is not sufficient to prevent an out-of-bounds access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the 'num' variable more thoroughly by checking if it is a valid index within the'sizes' array. This can be done by checking if 'num' is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 'count', and also checking if 'num' is an integer value.
2. Consider using a safer function to parse the input string 'buf', such as 'atoi' or'strtol',
