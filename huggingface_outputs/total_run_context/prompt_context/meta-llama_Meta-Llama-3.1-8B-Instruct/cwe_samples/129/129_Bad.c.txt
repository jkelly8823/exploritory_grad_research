VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds array access. The function `getValueFromArray` does not properly validate the `index` parameter, which can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the `array`. This is because the `index` is not checked against the length of the array in the case where the index is equal to the length of the array. The line `printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);` is attempting to access the array at the index equal to the length of the array, which is out of bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure the index is less than the length of the array, including the case where the index is equal to the length of the array.
2. Return an error message instead of attempting to access the array at the invalid index. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value;
    if (index < 0 || index >= len) {
        printf("Error: Invalid array index\n");
        return -1;
    }
    value = array[index];
