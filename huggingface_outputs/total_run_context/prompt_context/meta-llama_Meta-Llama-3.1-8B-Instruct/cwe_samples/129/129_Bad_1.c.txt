VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-129 because it uses untrusted input (the 'num' variable) to calculate an array index without validating it. The 'num' variable is obtained from the'sscanf' function which parses the input string 'buf' and stores the result in 'num'. However, if the input string 'buf' contains a value that is not a valid integer,'sscanf' will return a value other than 2, and the 'num' variable will be left with an arbitrary value. This can lead to an out-of-bounds array access when'sizes[num - 1]' is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the 'num' variable to ensure it is a valid integer before using it to access the'sizes' array. This can be done by checking the return value of'sscanf' and ensuring it is 2 before accessing 'num'.
2. Consider using a safer method to parse the input string 'buf', such as using a regular expression or a dedicated parsing library. This can help prevent unexpected behavior when dealing with malformed input. 
3. Consider adding a check to ensure that
