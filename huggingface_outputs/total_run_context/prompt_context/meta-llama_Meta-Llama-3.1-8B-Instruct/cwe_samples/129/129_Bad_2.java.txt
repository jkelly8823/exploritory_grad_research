 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because the index passed to the displayProductSummary method is not validated. The getProductSummary method uses this index to access an array, but if the index is out of bounds, it will throw an exception. The code does not handle this exception properly, as it simply catches the Exception class and does not provide any meaningful error handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the index passed to the displayProductSummary method to ensure it is within the bounds of the array.
2. Consider using a more specific exception type, such as IndexOutOfBoundsException, to handle this specific error.
3. Provide meaningful error handling in the catch block, such as logging the error or returning an error message to the user.
