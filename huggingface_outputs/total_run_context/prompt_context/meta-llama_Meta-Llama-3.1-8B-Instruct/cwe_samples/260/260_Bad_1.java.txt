VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code stores sensitive information such as usernames and passwords in a configuration file. This is a security risk as the file might be accessible to unauthorized actors, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system. The file is not encrypted or protected in any way, making it vulnerable to being accessed by anyone with access to the file system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store sensitive information such as usernames and passwords securely, using a secure storage mechanism like a secrets manager or an encrypted file.
2. Limit access to the configuration file to only those who need it, and ensure that the file is not world-readable.
3. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store sensitive information.
