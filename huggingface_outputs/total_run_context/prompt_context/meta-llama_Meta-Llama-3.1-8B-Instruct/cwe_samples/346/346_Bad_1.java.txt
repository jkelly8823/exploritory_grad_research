 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-346 because it does not properly verify the source of the URL. The URL is being compared to a hardcoded string, but it does not check if the URL is coming from a trusted source. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the URL. Only allow URLs that match a specific pattern or are coming from a trusted source.
2. Use a library like Uri to parse the URL and extract the scheme and path. This will make it easier to validate the URL and prevent injection attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure approach like IntentFilter to handle URL loading. This will allow the application to specify which URLs are allowed to be loaded and prevent malicious URLs from being loaded.
