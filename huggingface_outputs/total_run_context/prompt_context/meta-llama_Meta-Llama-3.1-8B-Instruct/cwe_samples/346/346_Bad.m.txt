VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential data injection attack. The `writeDataToView` method is called with user-controlled input from the URL query string. This input is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the web view. This could potentially lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize and validate the input from the URL query string before passing it to the `writeDataToView` method.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the types of data that can be injected into the web view.
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior in case of invalid input.
