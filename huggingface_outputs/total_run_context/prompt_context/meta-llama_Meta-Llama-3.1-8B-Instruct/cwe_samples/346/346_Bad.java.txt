 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-346 because it does not properly verify the source of the data or communication. The IntentFilter is set to listen for a specific action ("com.example.RemoveUser"), but it does not check if the incoming intent is actually from a trusted source. This could allow an attacker to send a malicious intent and execute the DeleteReceiver's onReceive method, potentially leading to unauthorized data destruction.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the source of the intent before processing it. This can be done by checking the intent's package name or signature against a list of trusted packages or signatures.
2. Use a secure method to pass the userID from the intent to the DeleteReceiver. Instead of using getIntExtra, consider using a secure method like Bundle or a secure data storage mechanism.
3. Consider using a more secure way to destroy user data, such as using a secure deletion algorithm or a secure data storage mechanism.
