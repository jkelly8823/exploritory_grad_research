 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to side-channel attacks due to the physical side channels that can be exploited through variations in power consumption, electromagnetic emissions (EME), or acoustic emissions. This is because the code uses a sequential logic to update the result register and the base register, which can be physically observable. The use of sequential logic can introduce patterns in the physical phenomena that can be exploited by an attacker to infer sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a constant time operation to update the result register and the base register. This can be achieved by using a combinational logic to update the registers in a single clock cycle.
2. Use a masking technique to randomize the physical phenomena, making it difficult for an attacker to infer sensitive information.
3. Use a secure protocol to encrypt the sensitive information and prevent it from being exposed through physical side channels. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 1300
CWE Description:
The device does not contain sufficient protection mechanisms to prevent physical side channels from exposing sensitive information due to patterns in physically observable phenomena such as variations in power consumption, electromagnetic emissions (EME), or acoustic emissions.
