 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-482 because the line "*p1 == i;" in the push function is using the equality operator (==) for comparison instead of the assignment operator (=). This will result in a comparison of the value of p1 with i, rather than assigning the value of i to p1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix is to replace the line "*p1 == i;" with "*p1 = i;". This will correctly assign the value of i to p1. Additionally, it would be beneficial to add a check to prevent the stack from overflowing, such as by checking if p1 is equal to tos + SIZE - 1 before incrementing it. This will prevent the stack from overflowing and reduce the risk of a segmentation fault. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The code uses a pointer to access an array without checking if the pointer is within the bounds of the array.

Code Sample:

                  #define SIZE 50int *tos, *p1, stack[SIZE];
                     void push(int i) {
                        p1++;if(p1==(tos
