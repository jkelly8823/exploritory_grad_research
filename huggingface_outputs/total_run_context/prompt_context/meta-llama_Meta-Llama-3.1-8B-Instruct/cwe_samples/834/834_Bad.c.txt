EXPLANATION:
The function do_something_recursive() contains a recursive call without a proper termination condition. The variable flg is never modified within the function, resulting in an infinite recursion. This can lead to a stack overflow error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a termination condition to the recursive function to prevent infinite recursion.
2. Consider using an iterative approach instead of recursion to avoid potential stack overflow issues. 
3. Modify the function to handle the case where flg is FALSE to prevent unnecessary recursive calls. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 835
CWE Description:
The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.

Code Sample:

	        void do_something (int n)
	        {
			int i;
			for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
				do_something_else (i);
			}
	        }
	        int n = 1000000; // Set to a large value
	        do_something (n);
