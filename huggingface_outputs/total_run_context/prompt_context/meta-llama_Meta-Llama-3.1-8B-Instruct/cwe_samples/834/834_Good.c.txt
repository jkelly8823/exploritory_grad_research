 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The function do_something_recursive() contains a recursive call without a proper termination condition. The function calls itself with the same parameter flg, which is not being decremented or checked for a specific value to stop the recursion. This can lead to a stack overflow error if the function is called with a large value of flg.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a termination condition to the recursive call, such as checking if flg is less than a certain value or if it has reached a specific state.
2. Consider using an iterative approach instead of recursion to avoid potential stack overflow issues.
3. If recursion is necessary, ensure that the function is properly optimized to handle large values of flg. This can be done by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 835
CWE Description:
The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.

Code Sample:

	       void do_something_iterative (int flg)
	       {
	       
		... // Do some real work here
		 // Modify value of flg on done condition
