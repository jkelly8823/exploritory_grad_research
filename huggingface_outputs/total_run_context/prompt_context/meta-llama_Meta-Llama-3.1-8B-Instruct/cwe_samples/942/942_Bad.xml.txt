 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the inclusion of the '*' wildcard in the allow-access-from directive. This allows any domain to access the application, potentially leading to security breaches. The presence of the '*' wildcard in the allow-access-from directive is a clear indication of this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the '*' wildcard from the allow-access-from directive to restrict access to only trusted domains.
2. Consider implementing a more secure cross-domain policy file that only allows access from specific, trusted domains. 
3. Regularly review and update the cross-domain policy file to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 
4. Consider using a more secure alternative to the cross-domain policy file, such as a Content Security Policy (CSP). 
5. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent potential XSS attacks. 6. Regularly scan the application for vulnerabilities and perform security audits to identify and address potential security issues. 7. Consider implementing a secure coding practice, such as using a linter or code analyzer, to detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 8. Ensure that all
