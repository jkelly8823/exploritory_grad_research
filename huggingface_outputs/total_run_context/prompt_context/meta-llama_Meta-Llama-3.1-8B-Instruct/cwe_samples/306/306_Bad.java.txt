 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The createBankAccount method does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity. This is a significant security risk as it allows anyone to create a bank account without proper verification. The method also consumes a significant amount of resources as it creates a new bank account object and sets its properties.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the createBankAccount method to ensure that only authorized users can create bank accounts.
2. Consider using a secure method to store sensitive information such as account SSN.
3. Optimize the method to reduce resource consumption by reusing existing bank account objects or using a more efficient data structure.

                        accounts[i] = new BankAccount();
                     }
                     return accounts;
