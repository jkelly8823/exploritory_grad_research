 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-306 because the authenticateUser method is not called before creating a new bank account. This allows an unauthenticated user to create a new bank account. The authenticateUser method is called, but its result is not checked before creating the new bank account. The variable isUserAuthentic is set to true or false based on the authenticateUser method, but it is not checked before creating the new bank account.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call the authenticateUser method before creating a new bank account and check its result.
2. Use a more secure approach to authenticate users, such as using a secure authentication protocol or a library that handles authentication for you.
3. Consider using a more secure way to store sensitive information, such as account numbers and SSNs.
