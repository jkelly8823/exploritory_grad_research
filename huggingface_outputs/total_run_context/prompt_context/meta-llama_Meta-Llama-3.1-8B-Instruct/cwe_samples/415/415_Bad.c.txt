 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code calls free() twice on the same memory address, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes. The first free() call is executed when the 'abrt' condition is met, and the second free() call is executed after the 'abrt' condition is met. This can result in the memory being freed twice, potentially causing issues with the program's memory management.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the second free() call should be removed. The corrected code should look like this:

char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
   
   free(ptr);
   
}
...
// Remove the second free() call
// free(ptr); 

This will ensure that the memory is only freed once, preventing potential crashes and unexpected behavior. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

int x;
if (x > 5) {
    printf("x is greater than 5\n");
}
printf("x is %d\n", x);
