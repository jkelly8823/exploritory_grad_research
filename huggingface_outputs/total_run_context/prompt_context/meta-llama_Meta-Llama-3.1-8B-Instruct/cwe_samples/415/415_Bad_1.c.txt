 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-415 because it calls free() twice on the same memory address. This is evident in the lines where buf2R1 is freed twice, once in the line "free(buf2R1);" and again in the line "free(buf1R2);". Although buf1R2 is a different variable, it is allocated on the same memory address as buf2R1 due to the nature of the malloc function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that memory is freed in the reverse order of allocation to avoid double-free vulnerabilities.
2. Use a memory debugging tool to detect and prevent such issues in the future. 
3. Consider using smart pointers or containers to manage memory automatically. 
4. Review the code for any other potential memory-related issues.  ```python
