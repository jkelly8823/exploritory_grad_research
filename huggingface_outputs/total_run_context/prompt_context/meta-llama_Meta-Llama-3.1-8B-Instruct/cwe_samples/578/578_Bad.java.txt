 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-578 because it uses the ClassLoader for this class to load the XML document from the local filesystem. This is a violation of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification, which requires that the ClassLoader for the EJB container be used to load resources. Using the ClassLoader for this class can lead to issues with class loading and resource management.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the EJB container's ClassLoader to load the XML document instead of the ClassLoader for this class.
2. Consider using a resource injection mechanism, such as @Resource, to inject the XML document into the bean.
3. If the XML document is not a resource that needs to be loaded at runtime, consider using a static resource or a resource that is loaded at deployment time. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20

The product uses a hard-coded string as a password.

Code Sample:

                  @Statelesspublic class InterestRateBean implements InterestRateRemote {
                     
                        private Document interestRateXMLDocument = null;
                           public InterestRateBean() {
                              try {
