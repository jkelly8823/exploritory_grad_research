 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-578 because it uses a custom class loader to load a class at runtime. This can lead to a violation of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification, which requires that classes be loaded by the application server's class loader. By using a custom class loader, the code is bypassing this requirement and potentially allowing malicious code to be loaded.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the application server's class loader to load the class instead of a custom class loader.
2. Remove the custom class loader and use the standard class loading mechanism provided by the application server.
3. If the custom class loader is necessary for some reason, ensure that it is properly configured and secured to prevent malicious code from being loaded. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

                            String unusedVariable = "Hello, World!";
                        }
                    }
