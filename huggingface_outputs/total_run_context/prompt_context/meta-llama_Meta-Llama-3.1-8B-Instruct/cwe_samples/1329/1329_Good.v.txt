 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1329 because the hmac_key_reg register is not updated when hmac_patch_en is not asserted. This means that the hmac_key_reg register will retain its previous value, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit a previously patched vulnerability. The hmac_key_reg register is not updated when hmac_patch_en is not asserted, which means that the hmac_key_reg register will retain its previous value, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit a previously patched vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the hmac_key_reg register when hmac_patch_en is not asserted to ensure that the register is updated with the latest hmac_key_i value.
2. Consider adding a mechanism to reset the hmac_key_reg register to a known good value when hmac_patch_en is not asserted. This can help to prevent an attacker from exploiting a previously patched vulnerability.
