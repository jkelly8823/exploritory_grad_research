 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hardcoded secret key in the `hmac` module. This key is used for authentication and is not updated or patched. This makes the system vulnerable to attacks where the attacker can obtain the secret key. The key is hardcoded in the `key_i` port of the `hmac` module.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and manage the secret key, such as a secure key store or a secrets management system.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like secret keys directly in the code.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as a challenge-response authentication protocol. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 1329
CWE Description:
The product contains a component that cannot be updated or patched in order to remove vulnerabilities or significant bugs. 

This vulnerability is related to the hardcoded secret key in the `hmac` module. The key is not updateable or patchable, making it a significant bug. 

Note: The CWE ID 1329 is a generic description of the vulnerability, and the explanation provided is specific to the hardcoded secret key in the `hmac
