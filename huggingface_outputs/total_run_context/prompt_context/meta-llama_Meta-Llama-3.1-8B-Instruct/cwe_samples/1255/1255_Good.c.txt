 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1255 because it monitors the real-time power consumption during security token evaluation. The line "password_ok |= 0x10;" and "password_ok |= 0x01;" are the points where the power consumption is being monitored. This information can be used to determine the value of the reference token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the lines that monitor the power consumption.
2. Use a secure method to evaluate the password, such as using a secure hash function.
3. Implement a secure way to handle the password retries, such as using a secure random number generator. 4. Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password hash. 5. Consider using a secure authentication protocol, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect. 6. Consider using a secure password validation library, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2. 7. Consider using a secure password storage library, such as bcrypt or scrypt. 8. Consider using a secure password validation library, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2. 9. Consider using a secure password storage library, such as bcrypt
