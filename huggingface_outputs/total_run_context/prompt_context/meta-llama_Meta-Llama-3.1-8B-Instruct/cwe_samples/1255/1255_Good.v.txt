 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a side-channel attack due to the use of a sensitive operation (power consumption monitoring) during security token evaluation. The always block is sensitive to the input 'a' and the output 'q', which can be used to infer the value of the reference token. This is a classic example of a power analysis attack, where an attacker can monitor the power consumption of the device to determine the value of the reference token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure random number generator to generate the reference token.
2. Use a secure encryption algorithm to encrypt the reference token.
3. Use a secure protocol to transmit the reference token.
4. Use a secure hardware component, such as a secure microcontroller, to generate and store the reference token.
5. Implement a power analysis countermeasure, such as a noise generator, to make it difficult for an attacker to monitor the power consumption of the device.
