 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The function do_something_recursive() is a recursive function that calls itself until the condition flg is met. However, there is no base case to stop the recursion when the condition is not met, which can lead to a stack overflow error. This is a classic example of a CWE-674 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we can add a base case to the recursion to prevent it from going on indefinitely. For example, we can add a check to see if the recursion depth has exceeded a certain limit, or we can add a condition to stop the recursion when a certain condition is met. Here is an example of how the function could be modified to include a base case:
```
void do_something_recursive (int flg, int depth = 0)
{
  if (depth > 10) { return; } // Add a base case to stop recursion after 10 levels
 ... // Do some real work here
  if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg, depth + 1); }
}
