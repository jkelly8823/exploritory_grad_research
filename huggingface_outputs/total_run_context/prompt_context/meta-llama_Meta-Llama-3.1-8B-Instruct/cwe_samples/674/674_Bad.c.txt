 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to infinite recursion. The function do_something_recursive() calls itself indefinitely without any base case to stop the recursion, leading to a stack overflow error. This is a classic example of a CWE-674 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a base case to the recursive function to stop the recursion when a certain condition is met.
2. Use a loop instead of recursion to avoid stack overflow issues.
3. Modify the function to handle the recursion in a way that does not lead to a stack overflow, such as using a queue or a stack data structure to manage the recursive calls.
