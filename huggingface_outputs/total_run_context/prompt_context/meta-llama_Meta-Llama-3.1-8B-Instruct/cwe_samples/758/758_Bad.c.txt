 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a function pointer vulnerability. The function pointer pt2Function is assigned a memory address 0x08040000, which is likely a location in the code that can be controlled by an attacker. This allows an attacker to inject code to execute, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This is a classic example of a function pointer vulnerability, which is a type of CWE-758 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to initialize the function pointer, such as assigning it a valid function address or using a secure function pointer initialization library.
2. Validate the function pointer before calling it to ensure it points to a valid function.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to function pointers, such as a callback function or a function object.
