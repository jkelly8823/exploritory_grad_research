 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-593 because it modifies the SSL context after connection creation has begun. This is evident in the line where the default password callback is set. The SSL context is created and an SSL object is created before the default password callback is set. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the default password callback before creating the SSL context.
2. Avoid modifying the SSL context after connection creation has begun. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle passwords, such as storing them securely or using a secure password storage mechanism. 
4. Ensure that the password callback is properly implemented to handle password changes securely. 
5. Consider using a secure random number generator to seed the PRNG. 
6. Ensure that the certificate and private key files are properly secured and not accessible to unauthorized users. 
7. Consider using a secure method to load the certificate and private key files, such as using a secure protocol or encrypting the files. 
8. Ensure that the SSL context is properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. 
9. Consider using a secure method
