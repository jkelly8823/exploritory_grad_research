 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a recursive call to the method doTweedledee() from the method doTweedledumb(). However, the method doTweedledee() does not contain any code that would cause it to terminate, resulting in an infinite recursion. This is an example of dead code, which can never be executed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the recursive call to doTweedledee() from the method doTweedledumb() or add a base case to the method doTweedledee() to prevent infinite recursion. Alternatively, remove the entire method doTweedledee() if it is not needed.
