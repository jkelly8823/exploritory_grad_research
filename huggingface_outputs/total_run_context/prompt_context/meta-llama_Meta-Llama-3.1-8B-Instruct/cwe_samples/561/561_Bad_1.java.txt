VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The method getGlue() is defined but never called in the provided code. This is an example of dead code, which can never be executed. The variable glue is also declared but never used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the unused variable glue and the unused method getGlue(). This will prevent dead code from being present in the codebase. The updated code should look like this:
public class Dead {
} 
or
public class Dead {
    public Dead() {}
} 
if the class is intended to be instantiated.  If the class is intended to be used as a utility class, it should be static.
