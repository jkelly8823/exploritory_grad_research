 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code calls sizeof() on a malloced pointer type, which always returns the wordsize/8. This can produce an unexpected result if the programmer intended to determine how much memory has been allocated. In this case, the sizeof() function is called on the pointer 'foo' which is of type double*. The sizeof() function will return the size of the pointer, not the size of the memory allocated by malloc. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation and potential buffer overflow issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the programmer should use the malloc function to allocate memory for the correct number of elements. For example, if the programmer wants to allocate memory for 10 doubles, they should use the following code: double *foo = (double *)malloc(10 * sizeof(double)); This will correctly allocate memory for 10 doubles, rather than just the size of the pointer. Alternatively, the programmer can use the malloc function with the number of elements as an argument, like this: double *foo = (double *)malloc(10 * sizeof(double)); This will also correctly allocate memory for 10 doubles.
