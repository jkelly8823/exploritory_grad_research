 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code calls sizeof() on a malloced pointer type, which always returns the wordsize/8. This can produce an unexpected result if the programmer intended to determine how much memory has been allocated. In this case, the programmer is trying to allocate memory for a double, but the sizeof operator will return the size of a pointer, not the size of the double. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation and potential buffer overflow issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the programmer should use the correct syntax to allocate memory for the double variable. The correct code should be: foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double)); This will ensure that the correct amount of memory is allocated for the double variable. Alternatively, the programmer can use the malloc function with the size of the double variable, like this: foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(*foo) * sizeof(double)); This will also ensure that the correct amount of memory is allocated.
