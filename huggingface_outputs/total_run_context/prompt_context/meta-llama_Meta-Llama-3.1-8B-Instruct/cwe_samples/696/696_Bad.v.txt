 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-696 because it performs multiple related behaviors in the wrong order. In this case, the grant_access signal is assigned before it is used in the always block. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the assign statement for grant_access to before the if-else statement in the always block.
2. Consider using a more secure way to grant access, such as using a secure authentication mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product uses a single, fixed-length buffer to store data of varying lengths, leading to potential buffer overflows.

Code Sample:

module foo_bar(data_out, usr_id, data_in, clk, rst_n);
output reg [7:0] data_out;
input wire [2:0] usr_id;
input wire [7:0] data_in; 
input wire clk, rst_n;
wire grant_access;
always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
begin
if (!rst_n)
data_out = 0;
else
data_out = (grant_access)? data
