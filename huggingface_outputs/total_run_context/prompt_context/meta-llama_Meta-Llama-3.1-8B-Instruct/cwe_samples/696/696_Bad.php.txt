 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-696 because it first reads the file into a string and then checks if the user is the owner of the file. This is incorrect because the file may be deleted or modified between the time the file is read and the time the ownership is checked. A more secure approach would be to check the ownership before reading the file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the ownership check before reading the file.
2. Consider using a more secure method to read the file, such as using a file stream instead of reading the entire file into memory. 
3. Consider adding additional checks, such as checking the file's permissions or the user's permissions to read the file. 
4. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any potential errors that may occur when reading the file.  ```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    if (isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
        $file = file_get_contents($filename);
        if ($file) {
            echo $file;
            return true;
        } else {
            echo 'Error reading file';
            return false;
        }
    } else {
