 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-268 because the ADMIN and OPERATOR roles are not checked for authorization. This allows an entity with the ADMIN or OPERATOR role to reset a user's password, even if they are not the user themselves. This is a security risk because it allows an entity to perform actions that would not be allowed without that combination of roles.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the requestingUser is the same as the user before resetting the password.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a permission system or a role-based access control system, to manage access to sensitive operations like password reset. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The code does not properly check whether a value is within the expected range before using it.

Code Sample:

public class User {
    public int id;
    public String name;
    public User(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
