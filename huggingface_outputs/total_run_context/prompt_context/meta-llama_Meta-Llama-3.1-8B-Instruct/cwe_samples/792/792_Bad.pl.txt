 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The variable $Username is not properly sanitized, and the use of the regular expression s/\.\.\/// does not prevent the traversal of the directory structure. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory. The ReadAndSendFile function is also not shown, but it is likely that it does not properly validate the file path before reading and sending it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input for $Username, ensuring that it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a library like Path::Class to properly sanitize the file path and prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Validate the file path before reading and sending it with the ReadAndSendFile function. This can be done by using a function like File::Spec->catfile to join the directory and filename, ensuring that the resulting path is within the intended directory.
