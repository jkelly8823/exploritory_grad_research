 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the variable "message" is declared with a fixed size of "length+1" but then the input string is copied into it without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer if the input string is longer than the allocated size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strcpy_s or strncpy to copy the input string into the buffer, which will prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a dynamic memory allocation function like realloc to allocate memory for the buffer, which will allow for more flexible memory management.
3. Always check the return value of malloc and realloc to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
                        int x;
                        int y = 5;
                        int z = x + y;
                        return 0;
                     }
