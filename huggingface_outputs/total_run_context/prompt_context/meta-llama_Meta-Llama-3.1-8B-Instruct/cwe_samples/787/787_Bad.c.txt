VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The id_sequence array is declared with a size of 3, but it is being populated with 4 elements. This can cause the program to write data past the end of the array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the size of the id_sequence array to accommodate the 4 elements being populated.
2. Use a safer method of populating the array, such as using a loop to ensure the correct number of elements are added. 
3. Consider using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized data.  ```c
int id_sequence[4];
/* Populate the id array. */
id_sequence[0] = 123;
id_sequence[1] = 234;
id_sequence[2] = 345;
id_sequence[3] = 456;
``` 
4. Alternatively, use a safer method of populating the array, such as using a loop to ensure the correct number of elements are added. ```c
int id_sequence[3];
int num_elements = 4;
