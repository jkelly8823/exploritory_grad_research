 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `strcpy` is used to copy the contents of `srcBuf` into `destBuf` starting from the index `idx`. However, the `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, and it will continue to copy characters from `srcBuf` until it reaches the null terminator. If `srcBuf` is longer than the remaining space in `destBuf`, the function will write past the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` to prevent buffer overflows. This function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy.
2. Check the length of `srcBuf` before copying it into `destBuf` to ensure that it does not exceed the remaining space in the buffer.
3. Consider using a safer function like `snprintf` to format the string and prevent buffer overflows.
