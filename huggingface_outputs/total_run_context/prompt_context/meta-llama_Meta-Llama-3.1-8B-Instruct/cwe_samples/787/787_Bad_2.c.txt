 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `strcpy` is used to copy the hostname into the `hostname` buffer. However, the size of the buffer is fixed at 64 characters, which may not be sufficient to hold the hostname. If the hostname is longer than 64 characters, the `strcpy` function will write past the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer function like `strncpy` to copy the hostname into the buffer, and ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the hostname. For example: `strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, sizeof(hostname));hostname[sizeof(hostname)-1] = '\0';` This will prevent the buffer overflow and ensure that the hostname is null-terminated. Additionally, consider using a more secure function like `snprintf` to format the hostname into the buffer.
