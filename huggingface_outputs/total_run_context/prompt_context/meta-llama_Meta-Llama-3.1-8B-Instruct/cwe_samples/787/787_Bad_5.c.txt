 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The line `WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;` is attempting to write data past the end of the `WidgetList` array, which is allocated with `numWidgets` elements. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, where an attacker could potentially write data to arbitrary memory locations, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line `WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;` to `WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;` is not necessary, but it's better to remove it to avoid any potential issues. However, the main fix is to ensure that the `WidgetList` array is not accessed out of bounds. To do this, change the loop condition to `for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++)` and remove the line `WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;`. This will prevent any potential buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, consider using a safer allocation function, such as `calloc`, to ensure that the memory is properly initialized.
