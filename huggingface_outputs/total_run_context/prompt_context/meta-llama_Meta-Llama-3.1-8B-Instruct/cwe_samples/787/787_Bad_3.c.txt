 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow because it does not check the length of the user-supplied string before copying it to the destination buffer. The line `dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];` can potentially write data past the end of the buffer if the user-supplied string is longer than the allocated buffer size. Additionally, the code does not check for null-termination of the user-supplied string, which can also lead to buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the user-supplied string before copying it to the destination buffer.
2. Use a safer function like `strncpy` to copy the string, which can prevent buffer overflow.
3. Check for null-termination of the user-supplied string before copying it to the destination buffer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a loop counter that is not initialized before the loop begins.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
