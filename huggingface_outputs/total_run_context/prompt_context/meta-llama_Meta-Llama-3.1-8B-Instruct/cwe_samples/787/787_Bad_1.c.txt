 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of `memcpy` with a calculated size that is one less than the actual size of the buffer. This can cause the function to write data past the end of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use `strlen` to get the actual length of the source buffer and pass it to `memcpy` instead of relying on the return value of `returnChunkSize`.
2. Consider using `strncpy` instead of `memcpy` to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Validate the input buffer size before performing the copy operation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int returnChunkSize(void *) {
                        
                           
                           /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
                           
                           
                           * else, return -1 to indicate an error
                           
                           
                           */
                          ...
                     }int main() {...int x; memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
