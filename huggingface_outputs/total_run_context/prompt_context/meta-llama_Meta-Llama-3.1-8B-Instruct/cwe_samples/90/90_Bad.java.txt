 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks. The searchFilter variable is constructed by concatenating user input (address) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious LDAP syntax, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a parameterized query or a prepared statement to prevent LDAP injection. For example, you can use the `searchFilter` parameter in the `search` method to pass the filter as a separate argument, rather than concatenating it with user input. Additionally, consider using a library that provides a safe way to construct LDAP queries. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product constructs all or part of a SQL query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL query when it is sent to a downstream component.

Code Sample:

                String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery(query);
