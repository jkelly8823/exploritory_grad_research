 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NullPointerException because it does not check if the username parameter is null before calling the length() method on it. This can lead to an unchecked NullPointerException if the username parameter is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can add a null check before calling the length() method on the username parameter. For example, you can use the following code: if (username!= null && username.length() < 10) {...} This will prevent the NullPointerException from occurring.

                        String html = "<html><body>Hello, " + username + "</body></html>";
                        response.setContentType("text/html");
                        response.getWriter().println(html);
                     }
