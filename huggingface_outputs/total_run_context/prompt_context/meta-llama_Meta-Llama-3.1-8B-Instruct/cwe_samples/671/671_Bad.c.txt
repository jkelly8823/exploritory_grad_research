 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-671 because the hardcoded password "Mew!" is used for authentication. This prevents the product's administrator from tailoring security settings to reflect the environment in which the product is being used. The hardcoded password is also a security risk as it can be easily discovered by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the password, such as a database or a secure storage mechanism.
2. Implement a more secure authentication mechanism, such as a challenge-response authentication or a biometric authentication.
3. Remove the hardcoded password and use a more secure method to authenticate the administrator. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a hardcoded value for a security parameter, such as a password, key, or certificate, that is used to authenticate or encrypt data. This makes it easier for an attacker to obtain the security parameter and use it to compromise the product.

Code Sample:

               int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
               if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
               
               printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
