 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a hardcoded password vulnerability. The VerifyAdmin function checks if the provided password matches the hardcoded string "Mew!". This allows an attacker to bypass authentication by knowing the hardcoded password. Additionally, the use of the equals() method for password comparison is insecure as it is case-sensitive and does not account for password variations. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure password storage mechanism, such as hashing and salting, to store the admin password.
2. Use a more secure method for password comparison, such as using a password verification library or a secure hash comparison.
3. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords directly in the code. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file. 
4. Consider implementing a more robust authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to handle admin authentication. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
