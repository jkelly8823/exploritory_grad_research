 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-226 because it does not clear the information contained in the resource (p_c) before making it available for reuse by other entities. In this case, the resource is cleared when the encryption process is complete, but it is not cleared when the reset signal is asserted. This can lead to sensitive information being leaked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Clear the p_c array when the reset signal is asserted. This can be done by adding the following code to the reset condition: p_c <= 0;. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to clear the array, such as using a secure erase function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
