 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-226. The `realloc` function is used to reallocate memory for the `cleartext_buffer` variable, and the `scrub_memory` function is called to clear the memory before reusing it. This suggests that the memory is being properly cleared before being made available for reuse.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it's always a good practice to ensure that memory is properly cleared before reusing it, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Consider adding additional checks or logging to verify that the memory is being properly cleared.  ```python
def scrub_memory(buffer, size):
    # Clear the memory using a loop or a memset equivalent
    for i in range(size):
        buffer[i] = 0
```  ```c
void scrub_memory(void* buffer, size_t size) {
    memset(buffer, 0, size);
}
```  ```java
public static void scrubMemory(byte[] buffer, int size) {
    Arrays.fill(buffer, (byte) 0);
}
```  ```javascript
function scrubMemory(buffer
