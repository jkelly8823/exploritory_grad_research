 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-226 because it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource (p_c[i]) before making it available for reuse by other entities. When the reset signal is asserted, the code sets the start and p_c[i] registers to 0, but it does not clear the information contained in the p_c[i] registers. This can lead to sensitive information being leaked or reused in unintended ways.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a line to clear the p_c[i] registers to 0 before setting them to their new values. This can be done by adding a line to set p_c[i] to 0 before the if-else statement.
2. Consider using a more secure method to clear the p_c[i] registers, such as using a secure erase function or a hardware-based clear mechanism.
