 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks because it uses the client's IP address for authentication. This is a security risk because an attacker can easily spoof the IP address of a trusted client and gain unauthorized access to the system. The use of the IP address for authentication is a weak security measure and should be replaced with a more secure method, such as a username and password or a secure token.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the IP address with a username and password or a secure token for authentication.
2. Use a secure method to verify the client's identity, such as a digital certificate or a secure authentication protocol.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as SSL/TLS, to encrypt the communication between the client and server.

                  if (in.equals("exit")) {
                     System.out.println("Exiting...");
                     System.exit(0);
                  }
