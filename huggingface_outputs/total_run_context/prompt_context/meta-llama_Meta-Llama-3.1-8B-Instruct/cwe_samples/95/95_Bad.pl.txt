EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a code injection attack. The handleConfigAction subroutine uses the param function to retrieve the 'key' and 'val' parameters from the CGI request. These parameters are then used to construct a string that is evaluated using the eval function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating the 'key' and 'val' parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelisting approach to validate the 'key' and 'val' parameters to ensure they only contain expected values.
2. Avoid using the eval function to execute user-supplied code. Instead, use a safer method such as using a module like CGI::Parser to parse the input.
3. Consider using a templating engine to separate the presentation layer from the business logic. This can help prevent code injection attacks by ensuring that user input is not executed as code.
