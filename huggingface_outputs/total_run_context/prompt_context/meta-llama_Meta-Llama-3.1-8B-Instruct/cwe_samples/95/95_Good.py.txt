 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-95 because it directly uses the input from the user without any sanitization or validation. The input is split into a list of numbers and then each number is converted to an integer using the int() function. However, if the user enters a non-numeric value, the int() function will raise a ValueError, which is caught and handled by the except block. But if the user enters a malicious input that contains code syntax, it can lead to a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval") vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to ensure it only contains numeric values.
2. Use a try-except block to catch and handle any potential errors that may occur during the conversion of input to integers.
3. Consider using a safer method to parse the input, such as using a library like numexpr or ast. 
4. Avoid using the eval() function or any other dynamic evaluation calls. 
5. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific input formats.  ```python
def main():
    sum = 0
    numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers:
