 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-95 because it uses the eval() function to evaluate user input as Python code. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The input is not sanitized or validated, making it susceptible to code injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer alternative to eval(), such as ast.literal_eval() or a parsing library, to evaluate the input.
2. Validate and sanitize the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, safe input formats. 
4. Avoid using eval() for any purpose, as it can pose a significant security risk. Instead, use a safer method to parse and evaluate the input. 
5. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection attacks. 
6. Consider using a library like numexpr or numpy to evaluate mathematical expressions safely. 
7. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur during the evaluation process. 
8. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date.
