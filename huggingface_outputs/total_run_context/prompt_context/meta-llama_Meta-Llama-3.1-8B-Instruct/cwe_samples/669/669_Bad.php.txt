 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-669 because it includes an external file (dbInfo.php) which may contain sensitive information. This file is not properly sanitized and may be used to inject malicious code. Additionally, the code uses the mysql extension which is deprecated and should not be used in production environments. The code also uses a query string to construct the SQL query which is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve database credentials, such as environment variables or a secure configuration file.
2. Use a secure database extension, such as PDO or MySQLi, instead of the deprecated mysql extension.
3. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, you can use the following code to construct the SQL query: $query = 'Select * from users where username=? And password=?';$stmt = $db->prepare($query);$stmt->bind_param('ss', $username, $password);$result = $stmt->execute();if($result){return true;}else{return false;} 
4. Remove the include statement and instead use a secure method to retrieve the database credentials. For example
