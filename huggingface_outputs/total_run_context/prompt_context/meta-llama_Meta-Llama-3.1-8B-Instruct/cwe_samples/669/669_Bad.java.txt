 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the improper handling of the BufferedReader object. The BufferedReader object is not closed in the finally block, which can lead to resource leaks if an exception is thrown. Additionally, the BufferedWriter object is not closed in the finally block either, which can also lead to resource leaks. This is a classic example of a resource leak vulnerability, where the application fails to release system resources in a timely manner, leading to potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Close the BufferedReader object in the finally block to prevent resource leaks.
2. Close the BufferedWriter object in the finally block to prevent resource leaks.
3. Consider using a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the BufferedReader and BufferedWriter objects.

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 669
CWE Description:
The product does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere, or improperly imports a resource/behavior from another sphere, in a manner that provides unintended control over that resource. 

This vulnerability is not present in the code sample provided. The code sample does not import any resources or behaviors from another sphere, and it does not provide any unintended control
