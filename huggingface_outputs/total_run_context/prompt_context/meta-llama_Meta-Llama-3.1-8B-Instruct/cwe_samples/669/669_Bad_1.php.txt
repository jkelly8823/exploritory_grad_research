 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-669 because it does not properly transfer a resource/behavior to another sphere. In this case, the resource is the user's email address. The code skips displaying the email address when the API flag is not set, but it does not properly import the email address from the getUserRecord function. This allows an attacker to potentially access the email address of a user.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly import the email address from the getUserRecord function by removing the continue statement and displaying the email address like other fields.
2. Consider adding input validation to ensure that the username and email address are not tampered with.
3. Use a secure method to handle the API flag, such as using a session variable or a secure cookie. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not validate the correctness of the input when it is used to construct a resource identifier.

Code Sample:

                  
                     
                     // API flag, output JSON if set
                     $json = $_GET['json']$username = $_GET['user']if(!$json){
                        $record = getUser
