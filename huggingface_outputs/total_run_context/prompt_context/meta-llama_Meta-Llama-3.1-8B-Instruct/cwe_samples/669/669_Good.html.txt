 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource import issue. The form action is set to a servlet named "FileUploadServlet". However, the servlet name is not properly validated or sanitized. An attacker could potentially manipulate the servlet name to import unintended resources or behaviors, leading to unintended control over the resource.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the servlet name to prevent manipulation.
2. Use a secure method to handle file uploads, such as using a library like Apache Commons FileUpload.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging to detect and respond to potential attacks.
