 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-282 because it does not properly verify the ownership of the process before attempting to kill it. Although the code checks if the process owner matches the requesting user, it does not handle the case where the process owner is not the same as the requesting user. In this case, it simply prints an error message and returns without taking any further action. This allows an attacker to potentially exploit this vulnerability by creating a process with a different owner and attempting to kill it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly handle the case where the process owner is not the same as the requesting user. This could involve raising an exception or returning an error code to indicate that the process cannot be killed.
2. Consider using a more secure method to verify the ownership of the process, such as using a secure authentication mechanism or checking the process's access control lists (ACLs).
3. Ensure that the `getCurrentUser()` and `getProcessOwner()` functions are secure and do not introduce any additional vulnerabilities.
