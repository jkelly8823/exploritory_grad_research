 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a single equals sign (=) for comparison, which is an assignment operator. This changes the logic of the if statement, making it always return true. The correct operator to use for comparison is the double equals sign (==).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the single equals sign (=) with the double equals sign (==) in the if statement. The corrected code should look like this: if (value == 100). This will ensure that the if statement correctly checks if the value is equal to 100.
