 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-480 because it uses the wrong operator in the case statement. The condition for the case statement is priv_lvl_o, but the code is trying to assign a value to debug_mode_d based on the value of priv_lvl_o. This is incorrect because priv_lvl_o is an output and cannot be used as a condition in the case statement. The correct operator should be used to assign a value to debug_mode_d based on the value of priv_lvl_o.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the case statement with a series of if-else statements to correctly assign a value to debug_mode_d based on the value of priv_lvl_o.
2. Use the correct operator to assign a value to debug_mode_d based on the value of priv_lvl_o. For example, use the if-else statement to assign a value to debug_mode_d based on the value of priv_lvl_o.
