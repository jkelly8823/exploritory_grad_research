 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (==) in the if statement. This will cause the function to always return 1 when the value is 100, and return 0 otherwise. This is a classic example of a logical error that can lead to unexpected behavior in security-critical code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the assignment operator (=) with the comparison operator (==) in the if statement. The corrected code should look like this: int isValid(int value) {if (value==100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);} 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for buffer overflow when copying data into a buffer.

Code Sample:

                char buffer[10];
                char* data = "Hello, World!";
                strcpy(buffer, data);
