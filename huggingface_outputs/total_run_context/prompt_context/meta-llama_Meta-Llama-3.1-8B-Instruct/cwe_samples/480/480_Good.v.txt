 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11, 14-16, 19
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-480 because it uses the wrong operator in the case statement. The condition for entering debug mode is based on the privilege level, but the assignment of debug_mode_d is based on the wrong privilege level. For example, when the privilege level is M, the code assigns debug_mode_d based on ebreakm, but when the privilege level is U, the code assigns debug_mode_d based on ebreaku. This is incorrect because the code should assign debug_mode_d based on the current privilege level, not the previous one.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Correct the case statement to use the correct operator.
2. Use a single variable to store the current privilege level and use it consistently throughout the code.
3. Remove the unnecessary assignment of priv_lvl_o.
