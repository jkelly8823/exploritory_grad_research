 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-480 because the operator used in the line "*p1 == i;" is incorrect. It should be "*p1 = i;" to assign the value of i to the memory location pointed by p1. The correct operator is the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the incorrect operator with the correct one: "*p1 = i;".
2. Add a check to ensure that p1 does not exceed the bounds of the stack before assigning a value to it. This can be done by checking if p1 is less than tos + SIZE before the assignment. 
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a linked list or a dynamic array, to implement the stack. This can help prevent stack overflows and underflows. 
4. Add error handling to handle cases where the stack is full or empty. This can include printing error messages and exiting the program. 5. Consider using a more secure way to initialize the stack, such as using a constructor or a factory method. 6. Consider using a more secure way to access
