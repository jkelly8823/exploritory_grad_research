 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow because the variable quarterSold is a long integer, which is 64 bits, but the sum of JanSold, FebSold, and MarSold could potentially exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a long integer. When this occurs, the value of quarterSold will wrap around to a very small or negative number, causing the calculateRevenueForQuarter function to produce an incorrect result.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a data type that can handle larger values, such as a BigInteger, to store the sum of JanSold, FebSold, and MarSold. Alternatively, use a checked exception to handle the potential overflow and provide a meaningful error message to the user. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product uses a hardcoded value for a configuration or other setting that is intended to be configurable.

Code Sample:

                 ...float calculateRevenueForQuarter(long quarterSold) {...}
                     int determineFirstQuarterRevenue() {
                       ...
                           // Calculate quarterly total
                           long quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;
                           
                           // Calculate the total revenue for the quarter
