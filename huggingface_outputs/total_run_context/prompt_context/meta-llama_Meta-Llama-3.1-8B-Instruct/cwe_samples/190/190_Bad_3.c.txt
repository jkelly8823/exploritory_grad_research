 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow due to the calculation of the `quarterSold` variable. The sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `short` data type, causing an integer overflow. This can result in a very small or negative value being stored in `quarterSold`, which is then passed to the `calculateRevenueForQuarter` function. This function expects a non-negative value, and passing a negative value can lead to incorrect results or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the data type of `quarterSold` to a larger integer type, such as `int` or `long`, to prevent integer overflow.
2. Use a library function or a custom function to check for integer overflow before performing the calculation.
3. Consider using a data type that can handle large values, such as `uint64_t`, if the sales data is expected to be very large.
