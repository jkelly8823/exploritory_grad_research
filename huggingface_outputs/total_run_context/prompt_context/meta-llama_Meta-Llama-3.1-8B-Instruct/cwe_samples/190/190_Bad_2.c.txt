 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow because the variable bytesRec is a short int, which has a maximum value of 32767. If the value of bytesRec exceeds this maximum value, it will wrap around to a very small or negative number, causing unexpected behavior. This can occur when the getFromInput function returns a large value, causing bytesRec to exceed its maximum value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the type of bytesRec to a larger integer type, such as int or long, to prevent integer overflow.
2. Use a safer method to handle the calculation, such as using a library function that checks for overflow. 
3. Add bounds checking to ensure that bytesRec does not exceed its maximum value. 
4. Consider using a more robust data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to handle large values. 
5. Review the getFromInput function to ensure it does not return large values that can cause integer overflow.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 190 CWE Description: The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger
