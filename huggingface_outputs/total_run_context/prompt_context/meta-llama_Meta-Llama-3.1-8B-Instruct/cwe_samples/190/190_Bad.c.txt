 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow due to the calculation of the number of images. The variable num_imgs is assigned the result of get_num_imgs(), which may return a large value. This value is then used to allocate memory for an array of img_t structures. If the value of num_imgs is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer, it will wrap around to a very small or negative number, causing the malloc function to allocate an incorrect amount of memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a larger data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the number of images.
2. Use a safe allocation function, such as malloc_s, that checks for integer overflows.
3. Check the return value of malloc to ensure that the allocation was successful. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used. This can cause the program to produce unexpected results or crash.

Code Sample:

int x;int y = x + 5;
