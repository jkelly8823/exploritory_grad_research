 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound. This occurs when the value of nresp is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. In this case, the value of nresp is used to allocate memory for the response array, and if nresp is too large, it can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a very small or negative number. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the response array is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use a safer method to allocate memory, such as using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle large values. Additionally, you can add a check to ensure that nresp is within a valid range before allocating memory. For example, you can use the following code:

```c
if (nresp > 0 && nresp <= INT_MAX / sizeof(char*)) {
    response = xmalloc(nresp*sizeof(char*));
    for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++) response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
} else {
    // handle error case
}
