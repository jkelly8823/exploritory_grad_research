 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-7 because it displays sensitive information about the product (the exception message) in the default error page. This can potentially reveal information about the application's internal workings or the nature of the error that occurred.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a generic error message instead of the exception message. For example, "An unexpected error occurred. Please contact the administrator."
2. Consider using a logging framework that allows you to log sensitive information without displaying it in the error page. 
3. If the exception message is necessary for debugging purposes, consider displaying it only in a development environment or to authorized personnel. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89

                  public void processArray(int[] array) {for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {if (array[i] == 0) {processZero(array[i]);}}}
