 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-410: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. This is because the maxActive, maxIdle, and maxWait parameters are set to relatively low values, which can lead to resource exhaustion under high load conditions. An attacker could exploit this by making a large number of requests for resources, preventing others from accessing the resource.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Increase the maxActive, maxIdle, and maxWait parameters to more reasonable values, such as maxActive="100", maxIdle="50", and maxWait="300000" (5 minutes). Additionally, consider implementing a connection pooling mechanism to improve resource utilization and prevent resource exhaustion. Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse.
