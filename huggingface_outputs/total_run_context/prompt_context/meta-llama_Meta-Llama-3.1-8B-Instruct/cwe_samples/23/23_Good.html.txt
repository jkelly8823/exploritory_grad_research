VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The "FileUploadServlet" action in the form is not validated, allowing an attacker to potentially upload a file to a location outside of the intended directory. This is because the servlet name is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path by including ".." sequences in the filename.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the servlet name to ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the file path and ensure it only points to a location within the intended directory.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a file upload library that handles path validation and sanitization for you.  ```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    file = request.files['file']
    # Validate the file path to ensure it only points to a location within the intended directory
    if file.filename.startswith('../'):
        return 'Invalid file path', 400
    # Save the file to a secure location
    file.save('/path/to/secure/location/' + file.filename
