VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The variable "filename" is constructed from user input and is used to construct the full path of the file to be uploaded. The code does not properly sanitize the filename, allowing an attacker to potentially upload a file to a location outside of the intended directory. This is because the code uses the "lastIndexOf" method to extract the filename from the Http header, which can result in a filename that contains directory traversal sequences such as "..". The code also uses the "indexOf" method to check if the filename contains the boundary string, which can also result in a filename that contains directory traversal sequences.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the filename, ensuring that it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a library such as Apache Commons Lang to sanitize the filename and remove any directory traversal sequences.
3. Use a more robust method to extract the filename from the Http header, such as using a regular expression to match the filename pattern. 
4. Consider using a more secure approach to handling file uploads, such as using a temporary directory and moving the file to the final location after validation.
