 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-862 because it does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. In this case, the code is displaying a private message based on the provided id, but it does not verify if the user is authorized to view the message. This could potentially allow an attacker to access private messages that they are not supposed to see.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add an authorization check to ensure that the user is authorized to view the private message. This could be done by checking if the user is the owner of the message or if they have the necessary permissions.
2. Use a secure method to retrieve the message id, such as using a secure token or a secure cookie. This would prevent an attacker from accessing private messages by manipulating the id parameter. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to authenticate the user, such as using a secure password hashing algorithm or a more secure authentication protocol. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to display the private message, such as using a secure template engine or a more secure method to escape user input.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID:
