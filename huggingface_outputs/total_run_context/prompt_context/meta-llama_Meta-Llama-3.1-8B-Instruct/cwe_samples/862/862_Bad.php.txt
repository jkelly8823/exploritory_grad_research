 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-862 because it does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. Although the code uses a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89, it does not check if the actor is authorized to access the database or perform the query. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add an authorization check before executing the query. This can be done by verifying the actor's credentials or role before allowing access to the database.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle user input, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters or values.
3. Ensure that the database connection is properly closed after use to prevent resource leaks.
