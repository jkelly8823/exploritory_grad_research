 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code has a debugging message enabled, which can potentially reveal sensitive information to an attacker. This is a common vulnerability in web applications, as it can help attackers understand the system's structure and plan a targeted attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the debug attribute to false in the compilation element to prevent debugging messages from being displayed.
2. Consider implementing a custom error handling mechanism to provide more informative error messages to developers while preventing sensitive information from being exposed to attackers.
