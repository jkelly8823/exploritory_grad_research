 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-575 because it uses AWT/Swing in a stateless session bean, which is not allowed by the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification. The presence of the BigDecimal class, which is part of the Java Standard Library, is not the issue, but rather the fact that it is being used in a context where it is not allowed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be refactored to use a different approach that complies with the EJB specification. One possible solution is to use a different data type or a different library that is allowed in EJB. For example, the code could use a primitive data type like double or float instead of BigDecimal. Alternatively, the code could use a library that is specifically designed for EJB, such as the Java Persistence API (JPA). The exact fix will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the EJB specification being used.
