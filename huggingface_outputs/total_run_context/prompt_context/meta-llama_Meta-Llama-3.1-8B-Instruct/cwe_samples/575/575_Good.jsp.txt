 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-575 because it uses AWT/Swing in an Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) application. The use of AWT/Swing in an EJB application is not allowed according to the EJB specification. This can lead to security issues and potential vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the AWT/Swing code from the EJB application.
2. Use a different technology or framework that is allowed in EJB applications.
3. Consider using a different approach to achieve the desired functionality without violating the EJB specification.
