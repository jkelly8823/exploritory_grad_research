 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1258 because it does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered. In this case, the debug_mode_i signal is used to select between a default value ('b0) and the actual key values stored in key_reg0 and key_reg1. This means that when debug mode is enabled, the actual key values are not cleared, potentially exposing sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to clear the key registers when debug mode is entered, such as assigning a default value of all zeros to the key registers.
2. Consider using a secure debug mode that does not expose sensitive information, such as using a separate debug key or encrypting the debug output. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all security-sensitive values are properly cleared when debug mode is entered.  ```python
def analyze_code(code):
    # Parse the code to extract the relevant information
