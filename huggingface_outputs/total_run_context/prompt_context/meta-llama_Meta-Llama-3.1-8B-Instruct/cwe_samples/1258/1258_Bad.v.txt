 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1258 because it does not fully clear security-sensitive values when debug mode is entered. In this case, the core_key0 and core_key1 assignments are not cleared when debug_mode_i is high. This could potentially leak sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clear the key registers when debug mode is entered by setting key_reg0 and key_reg1 to 'b0.
2. Consider using a secure method to handle debug mode, such as using a separate debug key or disabling debug mode when sensitive operations are performed. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all security-sensitive values are properly cleared when debug mode is entered.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 1258 CWE Description: The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered.  Code Sample:  module aes1_wrapper #(......  assign core_key0 = debug_mode_i? 'b0 : {  key_reg0[7], key_reg0[6], key_reg0[5], key_reg0[4], key_reg0[
