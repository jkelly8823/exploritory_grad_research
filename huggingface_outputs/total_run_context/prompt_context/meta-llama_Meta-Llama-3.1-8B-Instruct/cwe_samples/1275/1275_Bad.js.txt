 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The SameSite attribute for the cookie'sessionid' is not set, which makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The SameSite attribute should be set to 'Lax' or 'Strict' to prevent CSRF attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Set the SameSite attribute to 'Lax' or 'Strict' in the cookieOptions object. For example: `let cookieOptions = { domain: 'example.com', SameSite: 'Lax' }`. This will prevent CSRF attacks by only allowing the cookie to be sent with GET requests from the same site.
