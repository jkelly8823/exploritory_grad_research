VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-863 because it does not correctly perform the authorization check. The code first checks if the 'role' cookie is set, and if not, it sets it to 'user'. However, it then checks if the 'role' is 'Reader', which is a specific role, but it does not check if the user is authenticated or authorized to view the medical history. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by manipulating the 'role' cookie or by exploiting the getRole('user') function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a proper authentication and authorization mechanism to check if the user is authenticated and authorized to view the medical history.
2. Remove the getRole('user') function and instead use a secure method to determine the user's role.
3. Use a secure method to set and check the 'role' cookie, such as using a secure cookie library or a token-based authentication system. 
4. Validate and sanitize all user input, including the 'patient_ID' variable, to prevent SQL injection and other attacks. 
5. Use a secure method to display the medical history, such as using a templating
