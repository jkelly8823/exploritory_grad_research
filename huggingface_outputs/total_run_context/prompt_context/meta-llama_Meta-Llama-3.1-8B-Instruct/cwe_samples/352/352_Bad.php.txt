 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-352 because it does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. The session validation is performed using the session_is_registered function, which is deprecated and not recommended for use. Additionally, the update_profile function is not properly sanitized, allowing potential SQL injection attacks. The SendUpdateToDatabase function is not shown, but it is likely vulnerable to SQL injection attacks as well.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the session_is_registered function with a more secure method of validating sessions, such as using the session_status function.
2. Sanitize the user input in the update_profile function using a library like prepared statements or parameterized queries.
3. Use a secure method of updating the database, such as using a library like PDO or MySQLi. 
4. Remove the deprecated session_is_registered function and replace it with a more secure method. 
5. Validate the user input in the update_profile function to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
6. Use a secure method of updating the database, such as using a library like PDO or MySQLi. 
7. Remove
