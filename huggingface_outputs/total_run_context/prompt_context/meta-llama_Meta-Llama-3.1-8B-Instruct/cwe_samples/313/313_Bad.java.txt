 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code stores sensitive information such as usernames and passwords in cleartext in a properties file. This is a clear violation of security best practices, as sensitive data should be encrypted or hashed to prevent unauthorized access. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in a web application, as it could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive credentials.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store sensitive information such as usernames and passwords in an encrypted database or a secure secrets management system.
2. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information, rather than hardcoding it in the properties file.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure storage and management of sensitive information. 
4. Regularly review and update the properties file to ensure that sensitive information is not stored in cleartext. 5. Implement proper access controls to restrict access to the properties file. 6. Consider using a secrets manager like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage sensitive information. 7. Use a secure protocol to transmit sensitive information, such as HTTPS. 8. Consider using a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect. 9. Regularly
