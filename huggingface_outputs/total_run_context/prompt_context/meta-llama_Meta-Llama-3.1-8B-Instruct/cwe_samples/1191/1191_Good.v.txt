 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1191 because it does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface. The code allows users to access internal registers and test modes without proper authorization, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper access control mechanisms to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.
2. Use secure coding practices to ensure that sensitive data is properly protected and access is restricted to authorized users only. 
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and compliant with relevant security standards.
