 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to access control bypass through the physical debug/test interface. The condition `if (pass_mode)` is not properly validated, allowing unauthorized access to internal registers and test modes. This is a direct implementation of CWE-1191.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can access internal registers and test modes.
2. Validate the `pass_mode` condition to prevent unauthorized access.
3. Consider using a secure authentication mechanism to prevent access control bypass. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 1191
CWE Description:
The chip does not implement or does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.  VULNERABILITY LIST:

CWE Description:
The code of the software does not perform a check to verify the identity of a user, which could allow an attacker to access the system without proper authorization.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
