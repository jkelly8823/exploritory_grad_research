 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-114 because it loads a library from an untrusted source. The LoadLibrary function is used to load a dynamic link library (DLL) named "liberty.dll" without any validation or sanitization of the input. This allows an attacker to potentially load a malicious DLL and execute arbitrary code on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the LoadLibrary function to ensure it only loads trusted libraries.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow loading of specific, trusted libraries.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to LoadLibrary, such as a library that loads libraries from a trusted location. 
4. Implement a sandboxed environment to isolate the loading of libraries and prevent potential damage to the system. 5. Regularly update and patch the system to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 6. Use a secure coding practice to avoid loading libraries from untrusted sources. 7. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to load libraries, such as a library that uses a secure protocol to load libraries. 8. Implement a logging mechanism to track and monitor library loading activity. 9. Consider
