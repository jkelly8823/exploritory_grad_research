 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-114 because it is loading a library from an untrusted source. The library "library.dll" is being loaded without any validation or sanitization, which makes it susceptible to malicious code execution. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the library name and ensure it is coming from a trusted source.
2. Use a secure method to load the library, such as using a whitelist of allowed libraries.
3. Consider using a sandboxed environment to load the library, to prevent any potential damage to the system. 
4. Regularly update and patch the system to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the library. 5. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to load libraries, such as Java's `ClassLoader`. 6. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a dependency manager to manage library dependencies. 7. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to load libraries, such as Python's `importlib`. 8. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a dependency manager to manage library dependencies.
