 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The `getRuntime().exec()` method executes a command in a separate process, and the string "make" is not sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the input to the `exec()` method, leading to unintended behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer method to execute commands, such as `Process.Start()` with the `RedirectStandardInput` and `RedirectStandardOutput` properties set to prevent command injection. Alternatively, use a library like `System.Diagnostics.Process` to execute commands in a more secure manner. Additionally, ensure that any user input is properly sanitized and validated before passing it to the `exec()` method. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a string that is used in a format string operation without proper validation.

Code Sample:

                  String name = request.getParameter("name");
                  String greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
