 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the use of sprintf() with a user-controlled input. The variable DIR is defined as a constant, but it is still possible for an attacker to manipulate the path by using a specially crafted input. The use of sprintf() allows for the possibility of buffer overflow attacks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the code raises privileges to access the directory, which increases the attack surface.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like snprintf() to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
2. Validate the input path to prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Avoid raising privileges unnecessarily, and instead use the least privilege principle to access the directory. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to access the directory, such as using a library that handles path traversal and privilege escalation securely. 5. Use a secure method to construct the command, such as using a library that handles command construction securely. 6. Consider using a safer function like system() with a restricted set of arguments to prevent arbitrary code execution. 7. Use a secure method to drop privileges, such as using a library that handles privilege dropping securely
