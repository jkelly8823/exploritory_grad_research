 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-105 because the state and zipcode fields are not validated by a corresponding validation form. Although the state and zipcode fields have a mask applied to them, this is not sufficient to prevent CWE-105. The mask only restricts the input to a certain format, but it does not validate the input against a set of expected values. For example, a user could enter "AB" as the state, which would be a valid input according to the mask, but it is not a valid state. A corresponding validation form would have checked that the input is one of the valid states.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a validation form to check that the state is one of the valid states.
2. Add a validation form to check that the zipcode is a valid zipcode.
3. Remove the mask from the state and zipcode fields, as it is not sufficient to prevent CWE-105. The mask should be used to restrict the input to a certain format, but it should not be used as a substitute for a validation form.
