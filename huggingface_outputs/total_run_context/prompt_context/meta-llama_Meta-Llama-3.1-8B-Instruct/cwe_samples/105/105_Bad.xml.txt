 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-105 because the form fields are not validated by a corresponding validation form. This can introduce other weaknesses related to insufficient input validation. The code uses a form-validation tag, but it does not contain any validation rules for the form fields. The fields are only validated by the depends attribute, which is not sufficient to prevent CWE-105.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add validation rules for each form field inside the form-validation tag. For example, you can use the <validation-rule> tag to specify the validation rules for each field. Here is an example of how you can fix the code:
```xml
<form-validation>
    <formset>
        <form name="RegistrationForm">
            <field property="name" depends="required">
                <arg position="0" key="prompt.name"/>
                <validation-rule>
                    <rule-type>string</rule-type>
                    <rule-name>name</rule-name>
                    <rule-value>^[a-zA-Z]+$</rule-value>
                </validation-rule>
            </field>
            <field property="address" depends="required">
                <arg position
