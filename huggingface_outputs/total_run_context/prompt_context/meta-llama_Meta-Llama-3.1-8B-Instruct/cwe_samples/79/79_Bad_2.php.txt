 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-79 because it directly uses user-controllable input in the SQL query. The variable $query is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even deletion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input.
2. Validate and sanitize the user input to prevent any malicious characters from being injected into the SQL query.
3. Consider using a more secure database library, such as PDO or MySQLi, which provides better protection against SQL injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate the correctness of the assumedly valid input before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  $username = $_POST['username'];
                  $password = $_POST['password'];
                  if ($username == 'admin' && $password == 'password') {
                     // Login successful
                  } else {
                     // Login failed
                  }
