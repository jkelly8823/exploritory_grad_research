 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-79 because it directly assigns the user-controllable input from the Login.Text to the EmployeeID.Text without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the EmployeeID.Text, which can be reflected back to the user in the web page. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the Server.HtmlEncode() method to encode the user-controllable input before assigning it to the EmployeeID.Text.
2. Validate the user input using a whitelist approach to ensure it only contains allowed characters.
3. Consider using a more secure approach such as using a database to store and retrieve employee IDs, rather than directly assigning user input to a label. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user-controllable input for security-relevant operations.

Code Sample:

                  string name = Request.QueryString["name"];
                  if (name == "admin")
                  {
                      // grant access
                  }
                  else
                  {
                      // deny access
                  }
