 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-79 because it uses sprintf() to format the query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input values. The mysql_real_escape_string() function is used to escape special characters, but it is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks. The use of sprintf() with user-controllable input is a well-known vulnerability. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should be rewritten to use a more secure method of building the query string. For example, using PDO or MySQLi with prepared statements. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the syntax of user-controllable input before it is used in a command or API.
Code Sample:

                  $username = $_POST['username'];$password = $_POST['password'];if (empty($username) || empty($password)) {    echo "Please enter both username and password";    exit;}else{    // login logic here}
