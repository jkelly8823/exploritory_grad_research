 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input (eid) into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the eid parameter. The use of string concatenation instead of parameterized queries makes the code susceptible to this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Replace the vulnerable code with the following: string query = "select * from emp where id = @eid";sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);sda.SelectCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@eid", eid);sda.Fill(dt);string name = dt.Rows[0]["Name"];...EmployeeName.Text = name; This will ensure that the eid parameter is treated as a parameter and not as part of the SQL code, preventing SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to further improve the security and maintainability of the code.
