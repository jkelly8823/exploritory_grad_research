 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user input (eid) into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification. The use of a prepared statement or parameterized query would prevent this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a prepared statement with a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection. For example: 
   stmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from emp where id=?");
   stmt.setString(1, eid);
   rs = stmt.executeQuery();
2. Validate and sanitize user input (eid) to ensure it conforms to expected formats and values. This can help prevent malicious input from being injected into the query. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user-controllable input for security-relevant operations.

Code Sample:

                  String password = request.getParameter("password");
                  if (password.equals("mysecretpassword")) {
                     // authenticate user
                  } else {
                     // deny access
                  }
