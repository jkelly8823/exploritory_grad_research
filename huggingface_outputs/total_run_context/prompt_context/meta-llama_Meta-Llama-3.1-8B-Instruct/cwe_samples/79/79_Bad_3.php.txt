 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-79 because it directly uses user-controllable input from the $_COOKIE array without proper sanitization. The value of $name is directly taken from the "myname" cookie, which can be set by any user. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input. Only allow specific characters or patterns in the input.
2. Use a function like htmlspecialchars() to encode special characters in the input, preventing XSS attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve user data, such as a session-based approach.
