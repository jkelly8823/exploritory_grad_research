 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-79, which is a classic example of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code directly uses the user-controllable input from the 'username' GET parameter without any sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be executed by other users when they visit the page. For example, an attacker could inject a script that steals user credentials or performs other malicious actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input. Only allow specific characters or patterns that are expected in the username.
2. Use the htmlspecialchars() function to encode the user input before displaying it on the page.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve user data, such as using a session or a secure database. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate or incorrectly validates user-controllable input when using or before using the input to construct a SQL command or query.

Code Sample:

                  $username = $_GET['username'];$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'
