 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-79 because it directly uses the user-controllable input from the "eid" parameter without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code or manipulate the output by manipulating the "eid" parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input by checking it against a predefined set of allowed values or patterns.
2. Use a library like OWASP ESAPI to sanitize the input and prevent any malicious code from being injected.
3. Avoid using direct concatenation or string concatenation with user-controllable input. Instead, use a templating engine or a string formatting library that can safely handle user input. 
4. Consider using a parameterized query or a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks if the input is being used in a database query. 5. Always validate and sanitize user input on the server-side, never trust user input. 6. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks. 7. Regularly update and patch your web application to ensure you have the latest security fixes. 8. Implement a secure coding practice and follow
