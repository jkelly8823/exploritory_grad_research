 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-572 because it calls the run() method directly instead of using the start() method. This can cause the code to run in the thread of the caller instead of the callee, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the line "thr.run();" with "thr.start();". This will ensure that the code runs in the correct thread.
2. Consider using a more modern and thread-safe approach, such as using an ExecutorService or a thread pool, to manage threads and avoid potential concurrency issues.
