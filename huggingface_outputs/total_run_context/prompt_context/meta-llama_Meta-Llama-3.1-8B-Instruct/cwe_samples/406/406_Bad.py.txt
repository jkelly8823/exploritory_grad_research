 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of traffic volume monitoring. The recvfrom function is used to receive data from the network, but it does not have a limit on the amount of data that can be received. This allows an attacker to send a large amount of data to the socket, causing the program to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the settimeout function to limit the amount of time the recvfrom function waits for data to be received. You can also use the select function to limit the amount of data that can be received. Additionally, you can use a queue or a buffer to limit the amount of data that can be processed at once.
