 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1177 because it uses the `gets()` function, which has been explicitly prohibited due to its insecure nature. The `gets()` function does not perform any bounds checking, making it susceptible to buffer overflow attacks. This is a serious vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `gets()` function with a safer alternative, such as `fgets()` or `getline()`, which perform bounds checking and prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure input validation mechanism to ensure that the input data is properly sanitized and validated before processing it.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure input handling and validation, such as the `scanf()` function with format specifiers.
