 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1177 because it uses the strcpy function, which is a prohibited function in this context. The strcpy function is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks and is generally considered insecure. The use of this function in the manipulate_string function indicates that the code is using a prohibited function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the strcpy function with a safer alternative, such as strncpy or strcpy_s, which can help prevent buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, consider using a secure string library or function to handle string manipulation.
