VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-662 because it uses a fork() system call to create a new process, but it does not properly synchronize access to the shared resource (stdout) between the parent and child processes. The print() function uses putc() and fflush() to write to stdout, but it also uses sleep() to introduce a timing window, which can cause simultaneous accesses to stdout by the parent and child processes. This can lead to undefined behavior, such as interleaved output or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a lock, to protect access to stdout between the parent and child processes.
2. Avoid using sleep() to introduce a timing window, as it can cause synchronization issues.
3. Consider using a thread-safe I/O function, such as pthread_write(), to write to stdout in a thread-safe manner.
