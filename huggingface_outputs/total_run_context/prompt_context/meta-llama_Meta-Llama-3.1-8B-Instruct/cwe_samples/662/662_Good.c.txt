 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-662 because it does not properly synchronize access to the shared resource. The function f() locks the mutex, accesses the shared resource, and then unlocks the mutex. However, if another thread or process tries to access the shared resource while the mutex is locked, it will be blocked indefinitely. To fix this, the function should check the return value of pthread_mutex_lock() and handle the case where the mutex is already locked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of pthread_mutex_lock() and handle the case where the mutex is already locked.
2. Consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a condition variable, to protect access to the shared resource. 
3. Use a lock timeout to prevent deadlocks in case of a long-running operation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a function that returns a pointer to a local variable, which is no longer valid once the function returns.

Code Sample:

                  int f() {
                        int x = 10;
                        return &x;
                     }
