 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-688 because the accessGranted method is called with the wrong argument. The method is defined to take a String[] as an argument, but it is being called with a String array ADMIN_ROLES which is not an array of strings. This can lead to undefined behavior and resultant weaknesses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should be modified to pass the correct argument to the accessGranted method. The correct argument should be the userRoles array. The corrected code should look like this: return accessGranted(resource, userRoles);. Additionally, the method signature of accessGranted should be updated to match the correct argument type. The corrected method signature should look like this: private boolean accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles). 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The product calls a function, procedure, or routine, but the caller specifies the wrong variable or reference as one of the arguments, which may lead to undefined behavior and resultant weaknesses.

Code Sample:

                  public void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {String requestMethod = request.getMethod();if (requestMethod.equals("POST"))
