 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a transient execution attack due to the use of a pointer dereference on a potentially untrusted pointer. The line `array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];` is particularly concerning as it allows an attacker to potentially access arbitrary memory locations, which could lead to a transient execution attack. Additionally, the use of `untrusted_arg` to copy into `arg_copy` could also be a potential vulnerability, although it is less likely to be exploitable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `trusted_ptr` pointer to ensure it points to a valid and trusted location in memory.
2. Use a safer method to access the `array` element, such as using a bounds-checked index.
3. Consider using a memory-safe language or library to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
