 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a password field in the connection string, but it is left empty. This is a potential security risk as an empty password can be exploited by an attacker. The CWE ID 258 describes this vulnerability as using an empty string as a password is insecure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the password field is populated with a valid password.
2. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information like passwords. 
3. Regularly review and update the connection string to ensure it is secure. 4. Consider using a secure connection string builder to avoid hardcoding sensitive information. 5. Implement proper error handling to handle cases where the password is empty or invalid. 6. Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as hashing and salting, to protect against password exposure. 7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and compliant with security best practices. 8. Consider using a secure coding framework or library to help identify and prevent security vulnerabilities. 9. Implement a secure password policy to ensure that passwords are strong and unique. 10. Consider using a password manager to securely store
