 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-703 because it does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product. In this case, the fgets function may return a string longer than 9 characters, which can cause a buffer overflow when copied to cp_buf using strcpy. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use fgets with a smaller buffer size to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use a safer function like strncpy to copy the string, specifying the maximum number of characters to copy.
3. Consider using a more secure function like getline to read the input, which can handle longer input strings and prevent buffer overflows. 
4. Always check the return value of fgets to ensure it was successful before copying the string. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable-length array (VLA) that is not properly initialized, leading to undefined behavior.

Code Sample:

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i]
