 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to performance issues due to the use of boxed primitives. In the given code, the variable 'count' is declared as a long primitive, but it is being incremented with an integer value 'i'. This results in the creation of a new Long object each time the loop iterates, which can lead to performance issues in performance-critical operations. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Declare the variable 'count' as an integer to avoid boxing and unboxing.
2. Consider using primitive types for the loop counter 'i' to further improve performance. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The code may be vulnerable to integer overflow.

Code Sample:

				int sum = 0;
				for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
					sum += i;
				}
				System.out.println(sum);
