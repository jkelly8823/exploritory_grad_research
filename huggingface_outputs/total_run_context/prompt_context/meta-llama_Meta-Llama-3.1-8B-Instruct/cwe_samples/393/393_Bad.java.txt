 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-393 because it catches an IOException and returns a 404 status code, which is incorrect. IOException is a checked exception that indicates a problem with input/output operations, and returning a 404 status code implies that the requested resource was not found. However, in this case, the exception is thrown due to an I/O operation issue, not because the resource was not found. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Catch the IOException and handle it properly, for example, by logging the error and returning a meaningful error message to the user.
2. Use a more specific exception type, such as FileNotFoundException, if the code is expecting a file not found error.
3. Avoid catching broad exceptions like IOException and instead catch specific exceptions that are expected to be thrown by the code.
