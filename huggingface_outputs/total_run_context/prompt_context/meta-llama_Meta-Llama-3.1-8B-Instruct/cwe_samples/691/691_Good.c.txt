 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the case where pthread_mutex_lock() fails. If pthread_mutex_lock() returns a non-zero value, the function will return immediately without unlocking the mutex, leaving it locked. This can cause a deadlock if another thread tries to lock the same mutex.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of pthread_mutex_lock() and handle the error case properly.
2. Consider using a try-finally block to ensure the mutex is unlocked even if an exception is thrown. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for the existence of a pointer before dereferencing it, potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.

Code Sample:

                  int g(int *ptr) {
                        int result;
                           result = *ptr;
                           return result;
                     }

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The function g() does not check if the pointer ptr is null before dereferencing it. If ptr is null, this will result in a
