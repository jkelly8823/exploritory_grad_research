 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-691 because it does not manage its control flow properly. The condition in the if statement is evaluated, and if true, the code executes Do_X() and Do_Y() sequentially. However, if the condition is false, the code still executes Do_Y() without any control flow management. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add an else statement to handle the case when the condition is false, ensuring that Do_Y() is only executed when the condition is true.
2. Consider using a more robust control flow management approach, such as using a switch statement or a more complex conditional statement. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all possible control flow paths are properly managed and do not lead to unexpected behavior.  ```c
if (condition==true) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
} else {
    // Handle the case when the condition is false
}
```  ```c
if (condition==true) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
} else {
    // Handle the case when the condition is false
}
```  ```c
