 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential control flow modification due to the use of the 'file_get_contents' function, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code. Additionally, the 'isOwnerOf' function is not shown in the provided code, but it is assumed to be a custom function that checks if the user is the owner of the file. However, if this function is not properly implemented, it could also be exploited to bypass authorization checks. The'return true' statement after echoing the file contents is also a potential vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code by manipulating the file contents.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to read the file contents, such as using a library that can handle file contents safely, like 'fopen' and 'fread'.
2. Implement proper error handling for the 'isOwnerOf' function to prevent potential exploitation.
3. Remove the'return true' statement and instead use a more secure method to handle file contents, such as using a try-catch block to catch any potential exceptions.
