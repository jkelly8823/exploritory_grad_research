 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses pointer arithmetic to assign a value to a memory location that is one byte past the variable 'a'. This is an example of machine-dependent functionality, as the size of a char is not guaranteed to be 1 byte across all platforms. The use of pointer arithmetic to access memory locations that are not explicitly defined can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using pointer arithmetic to access memory locations that are not explicitly defined.
2. Use a more platform-independent way to access memory locations, such as using a pointer to a struct or an array.
3. Consider using a compiler flag or option to enable warnings for pointer arithmetic. This can help catch potential issues before they become problems. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 476
CWE Description:
The program does not have a check for buffer overflow on a write.
Code Sample:

                void example() {
                char buffer[10];
                strcpy(buffer, "Hello, World!");
                }
