 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-364 because the signal handler function, `handler`, accesses the `logMessage` variable without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition when the signal handler is triggered concurrently with other threads or processes accessing the `logMessage` variable. The `free(logMessage)` call in the signal handler also introduces a potential issue, as it can lead to a use-after-free error if the signal handler is triggered after the `logMessage` variable has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a thread-safe synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a lock, to protect access to the `logMessage` variable.
2. Avoid freeing the `logMessage` variable in the signal handler. Instead, consider using a separate thread or process to handle logging and freeing the memory.
3. Consider using a signal-safe function to handle the signal, such as `sigaction` instead of `signal`. This can help prevent issues with signal handlers interfering with each other.
