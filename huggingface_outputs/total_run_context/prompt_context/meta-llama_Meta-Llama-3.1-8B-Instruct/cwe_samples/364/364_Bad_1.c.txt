 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11, 17-19
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition. The signal handler is set to handle SIGHUP and SIGTERM signals, and it frees the memory allocated for global1 and global2. However, the signal handler is not thread-safe, and it can be interrupted by other signals or threads while it is executing, leading to a race condition. This can cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a thread-safe signal handler to avoid the race condition.
2. Avoid using signal handlers to free memory, as it can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Consider using a more robust memory management approach, such as using smart pointers or a garbage collector.
