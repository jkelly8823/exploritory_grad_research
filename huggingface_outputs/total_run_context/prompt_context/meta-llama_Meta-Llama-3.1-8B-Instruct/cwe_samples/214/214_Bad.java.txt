 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-214 because it directly retrieves the keystore password from the system properties using `System.getProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword")`. This can expose the password to other processes on the operating system, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the keystore. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the keystore password, such as using a secrets manager or an environment variable that is not accessible to other processes.
2. Consider using a secure way to handle the keystore password, such as using a password manager or a secure token. 
3. If the keystore password is not specified, consider using a default password or a password that is securely generated. 
4. Avoid hardcoding the password in the code. 
5. Consider using a secure way to handle the keystore, such as using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 20 CWE Description: The code does not check for a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the keystore password. Code Sample: String keystorePass = System.getProperty("
