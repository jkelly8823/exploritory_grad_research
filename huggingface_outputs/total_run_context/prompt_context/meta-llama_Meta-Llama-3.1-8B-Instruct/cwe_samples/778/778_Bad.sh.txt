 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a command used to update the logging settings for an Azure Storage account. It does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CWE-778 vulnerability, as it is a command-line interface (CLI) command and not a programming language. The command is used to configure logging settings, but it does not log security-critical events or omit important details about events when logging them.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet is a CLI command and does not require any modifications to prevent CWE-778. However, it is recommended to ensure that the Azure Storage account is properly configured and that logging settings are adequate for security and auditing purposes. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly review and update logging settings to ensure they remain effective.  The command should be run with caution and the account key should be handled securely.  Consider using environment variables or a secure method to store the account key.  Consider using a more secure method to authenticate with Azure, such as Azure Active Directory (AAD) credentials.  Consider implementing additional security measures, such as logging to a secure location, such as a central logging server or a cloud-based logging service.  Consider
