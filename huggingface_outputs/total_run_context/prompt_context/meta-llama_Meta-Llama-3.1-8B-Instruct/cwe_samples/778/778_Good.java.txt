 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-778 because when a security-critical event occurs (i.e., a login attempt), the product omits important details about the event when logging it. In this case, the log message for a failed login attempt does not include any information about the user or the reason for the failure. This makes it difficult to diagnose and investigate security incidents.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Modify the log message for a failed login attempt to include the username and the reason for the failure. For example: log.warn("Login attempt by user {} failed due to {}", username, reasonForFailure);
2. Consider using a more detailed logging mechanism, such as a structured logging framework, to capture additional information about security-critical events. This can help with incident response and investigation. 3. Ensure that all security-critical events are logged with sufficient detail to facilitate incident response and investigation. 4. Consider implementing a centralized logging system to collect and store log data from multiple sources, making it easier to analyze and investigate security incidents. 5. Regularly review and update the logging configuration to ensure that it is aligned with the organization's security policies and incident
