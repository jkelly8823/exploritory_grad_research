 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code does not record the event when the login is unsuccessful. This is a security-critical event and the product omits important details about the event when logging it. The login attempt is a security-critical event and should be logged regardless of the outcome.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a log statement to record the login attempt when the login is unsuccessful. For example, log the username and the reason for the login failure.
2. Consider adding a log statement to record the login attempt when the login is successful. This will provide a complete audit trail of all login attempts.
