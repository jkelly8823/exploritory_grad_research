 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is using the Set-AzStorageServiceLoggingProperty cmdlet to configure logging for an Azure Storage Queue service. The cmdlet is being used to set the logging operations to include read, write, and delete, and to set the retention period to 5 days. However, the code does not appear to be missing any critical event logging information. The logging operations specified are standard and cover the typical actions that would be performed on a storage queue. The retention period is also set to a reasonable value, which is 5 days. Therefore, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-778 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the CWE-778 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the logging configuration and retention period to ensure they meet the specific requirements of the application. Additionally, consider implementing additional logging mechanisms to capture any security-critical events that may not be covered by the standard logging operations specified in this code.
