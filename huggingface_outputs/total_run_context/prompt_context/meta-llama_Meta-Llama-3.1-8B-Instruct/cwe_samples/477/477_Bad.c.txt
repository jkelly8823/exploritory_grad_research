 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the deprecated function getpw() and the obsolete function crypt(). The getpw() function is used to retrieve information about a user, but it is not recommended to use it as it can lead to security issues. The crypt() function is used to encrypt passwords, but it is also deprecated and should be replaced with a more secure alternative such as bcrypt or Argon2.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the getpw() function with a more secure alternative such as getpwnam() or getpwuid(). Replace the crypt() function with a more secure alternative such as bcrypt or Argon2. Consider using a password hashing library such as libpwent or cryptopp. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code uses a function that is not thread-safe, which can lead to data corruption or other issues when used in a multi-threaded environment.

Code Sample:

                 ...for (i=0; i<10; i++){strcat(str, "Hello, World!");}...
