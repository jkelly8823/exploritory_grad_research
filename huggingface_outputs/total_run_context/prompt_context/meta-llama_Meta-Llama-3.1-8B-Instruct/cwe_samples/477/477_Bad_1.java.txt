 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the deprecated String constructor that takes a byte array and an offset. This constructor has been deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. The recommended replacement is to use the String constructor that takes a byte array and an encoding, such as String name = new String(nameBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the deprecated String constructor with the recommended one. For example, String name = new String(nameBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the String constructor that takes a byte array and an offset, which can lead to potential security issues if the input is not properly sanitized. This is because the constructor does not perform any
