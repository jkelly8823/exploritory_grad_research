 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses sockets instead of using framework method calls, which is a potential security risk. This can be exploited by an attacker to bypass security measures implemented by the framework.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the framework's built-in methods for making HTTP requests instead of directly using sockets. For example, you can use the `HttpURLConnection` class to make a connection to the remote server. This will ensure that the framework's security measures are applied to the request. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The J2EE application does not properly validate user input.

Code Sample:

                  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                        
                           
                           // Perform servlet tasks.
                          ...
                           
                           // Get a parameter from the request.
                           String param = request.getParameter("param");
                           
                           // Use the parameter in a query.
                           String query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = '" + param + "'";
                           
                           // Execute the query.
                           Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
                           stmt.executeQuery(query);
                     }
