 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-614 because the Secure attribute is not set for the cookie. This means that the cookie will be sent in plaintext over an HTTP session, potentially exposing sensitive information. The cookie is being added to the response without specifying the Secure attribute, which is a requirement for secure cookies in HTTPS sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add the Secure attribute to the cookie by modifying the code to include the Secure flag when creating the cookie. For example: Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID, null, -1, true); This will ensure that the cookie is only sent over a secure connection. 
2. Consider using the HttpOnly attribute to prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie. This can be added by modifying the code to include the HttpOnly flag when creating the cookie. For example: Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID, null, -1, true, true); This will prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 3. Ensure that the cookie is only set when the user is logged in and the session is secure. This can be
