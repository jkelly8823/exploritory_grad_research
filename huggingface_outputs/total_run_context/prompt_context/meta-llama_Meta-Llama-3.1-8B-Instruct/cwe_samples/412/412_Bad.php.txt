 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-412: Uncontrolled Resource Release. The lock on the log file is released regardless of whether the write operation was successful or not. This can lead to a situation where the lock is released prematurely, allowing other processes to access the log file before the write operation is complete. This can result in data corruption or loss.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a try-finally block to ensure that the lock is released even if an exception is thrown.
2. Use a lock timeout to prevent the program from hanging indefinitely if it cannot obtain the lock.
3. Consider using a more robust logging mechanism that does not rely on file locks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program does not properly check for the existence of a resource before using it.

Code Sample:

                  function getCustomerData($customerID){$customerData = array();$customerData = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customerID = '$customerID'");if (mysql_num_rows($customerData) > 0) {$customerData = mysql_fetch_array($customerData);return $customer
