 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a comment that does not accurately describe the code. The comment states that the patient weight and Mg/Kg should be added to calculate the correct daily dose, but the code actually multiplies the two values together.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The comment should be updated to accurately reflect the code. For example, the comment could state that the patient weight and Mg/Kg are multiplied together to calculate the correct daily dose. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

		     int pt_weight = 83;
		     int mg_per_kg = 3;
		     int daily_dose = 0;
		     
		     // Add the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose
		     daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg;
		   
                   }
		 
                 }
