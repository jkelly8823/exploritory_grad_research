 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a comment that does not accurately describe the code. The comment states that it multiplies the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose, but the code actually assigns the result of the multiplication to the variable daily_dose, and then does not use the variable daily_dose anywhere in the code. The correct daily dose is not calculated or used in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the comment as it is misleading.
2. Assign the result of the multiplication to a variable that is actually used in the code.
3. Calculate the correct daily dose and use it in the code.

		     int pt_weight = 83;
		     int mg_per_kg = 3;
		     int daily_dose = 0;
		     
		     // Multiply the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose
		     daily_dose = pt_weight * mg
