 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-576 because it uses the java.io package, which is not allowed in Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) specification. The getInterestRateFromXMLParser method is likely using an XML parser API, which is not a standard EJB feature. This could lead to security issues and non-compliance with the EJB specification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the java.io package with a standard EJB feature, such as the javax.xml.parsers package.
2. Consider using a different approach to retrieve the interest rate, such as using a database or a web service. 
3. Review the EJB specification to ensure compliance with all requirements.  ```bash
