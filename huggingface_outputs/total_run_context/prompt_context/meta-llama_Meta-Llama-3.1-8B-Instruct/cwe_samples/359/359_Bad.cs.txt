 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-359 because it is logging sensitive information (passwords) in a non-secure manner. The password is being concatenated with other information and then written to a log file, which could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties. This is a serious security risk as it could lead to the exposure of sensitive user credentials.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure logging mechanism that does not log sensitive information, such as passwords.
2. Hash or encrypt the password before logging it, to prevent it from being readable.
3. Limit access to the log file to only authorized personnel. 
4. Consider using a secure logging framework that provides built-in security features, such as encryption and access control.  ```python
import logging

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Set the logging level to DEBUG
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a file handler
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('log.txt')

# Create a formatter and set it for the file handler
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
