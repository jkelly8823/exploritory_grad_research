 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-359 because it does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected. The getLastLocation() method returns the current location of the user, which may contain sensitive information such as GPS coordinates. This information can be accessed by anyone who has access to the code, including potential attackers. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement proper access control and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the user's location.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper access control and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the user's location.
2. Use a secure method to store and transmit the user's location, such as encryption.
3. Consider using a secure location service that provides access control and authentication mechanisms out of the box. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities that could compromise the user's location.  ```
