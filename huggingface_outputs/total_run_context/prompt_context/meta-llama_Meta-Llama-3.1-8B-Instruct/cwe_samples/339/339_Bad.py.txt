 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `os.urandom(2)` function to generate a 2-byte seed for the PRNG. However, this is a relatively small seed space, making it susceptible to brute force attacks. A better approach would be to use a larger seed space, such as `os.urandom(16)` or more, to make it more difficult to predict the seed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a larger seed space, such as `os.urandom(16)` or more, to make it more difficult to predict the seed. This can be achieved by replacing the line `seed = os.urandom(2)` with `seed = os.urandom(16)`. Additionally, consider using a cryptographically secure PRNG, such as `secrets` module in Python, which is designed to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code does not properly validate user input, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Code Sample:

			   
				 # getting 2 bytes of randomness for the seeding the PRNG 
				 seed = os.urandom(2)
				 random
