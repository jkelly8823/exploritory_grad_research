 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-749 due to the presence of a potentially dangerous SQL command, "DROP DATABASE", which is executed directly from the user input without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially drop any database, leading to data loss and other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the databaseName input to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not pose a threat to the database.
2. Use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as access control and auditing, to further protect the database. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external control input to construct a string that is used in a command or query, but the input is not properly sanitized.

Code Sample:

public void generateReport(String reportName) {
    String reportPath = "/reports/" + reportName + ".pdf";
    File file = new File(reportPath);
    if (file.exists()) {
        // report exists, do something
    } else {
        // report does not exist,
