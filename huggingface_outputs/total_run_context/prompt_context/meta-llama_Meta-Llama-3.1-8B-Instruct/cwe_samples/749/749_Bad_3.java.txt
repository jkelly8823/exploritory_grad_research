 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-749 due to the presence of the `@JavascriptInterface` annotation on the `getUserInfo()` method. This annotation allows JavaScript code to access the Java method, which in turn allows access to the `currentUser.Info()` method. However, the `currentUser.Info()` method is not properly restricted, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `@JavascriptInterface` annotation from the `getUserInfo()` method to prevent JavaScript code from accessing it.
2. Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to the `currentUser.Info()` method.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a secure API or a trusted interface, to interact with external actors.

                        int y = x + z;
                    }
