 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-749 because it exposes a JavaScript interface to the WebView, which allows JavaScript code to access native methods. In this case, the `getUserInfo()` method is exposed, which can potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive information about the current user. This is a dangerous method because it can be called from JavaScript code, which may not be trusted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `addJavascriptInterface()` method call to prevent JavaScript code from accessing native methods.
2. If the `getUserInfo()` method is necessary, consider using a more secure approach, such as using a secure communication channel (e.g., HTTPS) to exchange user information between the WebView and the native app.
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent any potential security issues related to user input.
