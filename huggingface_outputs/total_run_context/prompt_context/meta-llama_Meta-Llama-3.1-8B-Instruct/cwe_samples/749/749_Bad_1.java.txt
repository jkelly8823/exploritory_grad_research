 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-749 due to the presence of a potentially dangerous method 'writeDataToView' which is not properly restricted. The'shouldOverrideUrlLoading' method is intended to handle URL loading in a WebView, but it contains a conditional statement that calls 'writeDataToView' when the URL matches a specific pattern. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data by crafting a malicious URL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the 'writeDataToView' method call and instead handle the URL loading in a secure manner.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the URL to prevent potential attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of URLs that can be loaded in the WebView.
