 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-749 because it allows an attacker to execute a potentially dangerous SQL command, specifically the "DROP DATABASE" statement, by manipulating the databaseName parameter. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to delete arbitrary databases, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the databaseName parameter to ensure it only contains valid database names.
2. Use a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as access control or auditing, to prevent unauthorized database modifications. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external control input without proper validation as part of its internal logic flow, leading to an unexpected behavior.

Code Sample:

                  public void processRequest(String request) {
                        if (request.equals("start")) {
                              startService();
                        } else if (request.equals("stop")) {
                              stopService();
                        } else {
                              // do nothing
                        }
                  }
