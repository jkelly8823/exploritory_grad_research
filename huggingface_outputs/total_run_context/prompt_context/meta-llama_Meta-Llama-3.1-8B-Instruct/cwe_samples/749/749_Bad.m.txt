 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a dangerous method or function being called through the URL scheme. The `shouldStartLoadWithRequest` method is not properly restricted, allowing an attacker to call the `specialFunction` through the URL scheme. This could potentially lead to unauthorized data being made available to the web view.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the URL scheme and resource specifier to ensure they are not malicious.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the `functionString` variable.
3. Consider using a more secure method to pass data to the web view, such as using a secure API or a more controlled data exchange mechanism.
