 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 20-22
EXPLANATION:
The code does not properly clear sensitive information from built-in registers when the user of the hardware block changes. This is evident in the lines where the data array is being cleared. The data array is being cleared when the reset signal is asserted, but it is not being cleared when the hashValid signal changes. This is a potential security vulnerability as sensitive information may be left in the registers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Clear the data array when the hashValid signal changes. This can be done by adding an else statement to the if-else block to clear the data array when hashValid changes. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to clear the registers, such as using a secure erase function.
