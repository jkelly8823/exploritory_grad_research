 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information leakage due to the lack of proper clearing of sensitive information from built-in registers when the user of the hardware block changes. The registers are not being properly reset, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a proper reset mechanism to clear the sensitive information from the built-in registers when the user of the hardware block changes.
2. Use a secure method to initialize the registers with default values, such as using a secure random number generator.
3. Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) to securely store and manage sensitive information. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 1239
CWE Description:
The hardware product does not properly clear sensitive information from built-in registers when the user of the hardware block changes.  The code does not properly reset the registers, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.  This is a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention.  The recommended fix is to add a proper reset mechanism to clear the sensitive information from the built-in registers when the user of the hardware block changes.  This can be achieved by adding a reset
