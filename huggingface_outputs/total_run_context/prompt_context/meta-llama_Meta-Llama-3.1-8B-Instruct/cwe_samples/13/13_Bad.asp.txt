EXPLANATION:
The code contains a plaintext password in the connectionString attribute of the add element. This is a security risk as it allows anyone who can read the configuration file to access the password-protected resource.

To fix this issue, consider using a secure method to store the password, such as environment variables or a secrets manager. You can also use a placeholder for the password in the configuration file and load the actual password from an external source during runtime. Additionally, ensure that the configuration file has proper access controls in place to limit who can read it.
