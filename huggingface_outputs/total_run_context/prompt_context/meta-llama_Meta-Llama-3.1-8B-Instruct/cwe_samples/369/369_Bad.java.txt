 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a division by zero error. This is because if the number of requests (numRequests) is zero, the function will attempt to divide the total time by zero, resulting in an ArithmeticException. This is a classic example of a CWE-369 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we can add a simple check to ensure that the number of requests is not zero before performing the division. Here's an updated version of the function: 
public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests) {if (numRequests == 0) {throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of requests cannot be zero");} return totalTime / numRequests;} 
Alternatively, we can also consider using a try-catch block to handle the ArithmeticException and provide a more user-friendly error message. 
public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests) {try {return totalTime / numRequests;} catch (ArithmeticException e) {throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of requests cannot be zero", e);}} 
Either of these approaches will prevent the division by zero error and ensure that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
