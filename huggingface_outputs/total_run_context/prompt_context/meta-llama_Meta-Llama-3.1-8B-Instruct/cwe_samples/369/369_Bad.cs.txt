 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a division by zero error. This is because the function Division takes two integer parameters, x and y, and returns their quotient. However, if y is zero, the function will throw a DivideByZeroException. This is a classic example of a CWE-369 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we can add a simple check to ensure that y is not zero before performing the division. Here's an updated version of the function: 
int Division(int x, int y){ 
    if (y == 0) { 
        throw new DivideByZeroException("Cannot divide by zero"); 
    } 
    return (x / y); 
} 
Alternatively, we can also consider using a try-catch block to handle the DivideByZeroException and provide a more user-friendly error message. 
```csharp
int Division(int x, int y){ 
    try { 
        return (x / y); 
    } catch (DivideByZeroException ex) { 
        throw new DivideByZeroException("Cannot divide by zero", ex); 
    } 
}
```
