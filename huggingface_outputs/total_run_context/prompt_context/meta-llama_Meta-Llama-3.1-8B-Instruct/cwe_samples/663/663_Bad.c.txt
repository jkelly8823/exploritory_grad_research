 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The function getpwnam() is a non-reentrant function, which means it is not thread-safe. It retrieves information about a user from the password database, and its state can be influenced by other threads or processes. In this code, getpwnam() is called in a concurrent context, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The function ispwnam() is also non-reentrant. The function getlogin() is also non-reentrant. The function isTrustedGroup() is also non-reentrant. The function allow() and deny() are also non-reentrant. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use thread-safe alternatives to these functions. For example, you can use getpwnam_r() instead of getpwnam(), which is a reentrant version of the function. Similarly, you can use getlogin_r() instead of getlogin(). You can also use a lock to synchronize access to these functions. Additionally, you can consider using a thread-safe way to check if a group is trusted, such as using a hash table to store the trusted groups.
