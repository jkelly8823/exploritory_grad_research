 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-360 because it relies on the event location (e.getSource() == button) to determine the source of the action event. This can be spoofed by an attacker who can manipulate the event location, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. In this case, the code prints out "secret information" when the button is clicked, but an attacker could potentially trigger this action by manipulating the event location.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to determine the source of the action event, such as checking the event's action command or using a more robust authentication mechanism.
2. Consider using a more secure way to handle sensitive information, such as encrypting it or using a secure storage mechanism. 
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent potential attacks. 
4. Consider using a more secure event handling mechanism, such as using a event bus or a more secure event handling framework. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 6. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 7. Implement a secure coding
