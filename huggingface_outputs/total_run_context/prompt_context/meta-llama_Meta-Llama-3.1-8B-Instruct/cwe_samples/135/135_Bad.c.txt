 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-135 because it incorrectly calculates the length of the wide string using wcslen(). The wcslen() function does not include the terminating null character in its count, which can lead to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for the new string. The correct way to calculate the length is to add 1 to the result of wcslen().
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the correct formula to calculate the length of the wide string: `wcslen(wideString) + 1`.
2. Always include the terminating null character when allocating memory for strings. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product does not correctly handle the case where a memory allocation function fails.

Code Sample:

                  #include <stdio.h>
                     int main() {
                        int *ptr;
                        ptr = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
                        if (ptr == NULL) {
                            printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
                        }
                        else {
                            printf("Memory allocation successful\n");
                        }
                        free(ptr);
                        return 0;
                     }
