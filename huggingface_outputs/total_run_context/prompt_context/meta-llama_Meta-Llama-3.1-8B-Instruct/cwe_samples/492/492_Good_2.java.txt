VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-28
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an inner class that implements ActionListener interface. This inner class is accessible at package scope and may expose code that the programmer intended to keep private to attackers. The inner class has access to the private member variables of the BankAccount class, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the ActionListener implementation to a separate class to avoid exposing sensitive code.
2. Use a more secure approach to add interest to the balance, such as using a separate method or a thread-safe approach.
3. Consider using a more secure timer implementation, such as a ScheduledExecutorService, to avoid potential timing attacks.
