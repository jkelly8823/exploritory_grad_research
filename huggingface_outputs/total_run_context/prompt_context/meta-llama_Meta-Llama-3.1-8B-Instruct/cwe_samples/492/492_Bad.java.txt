EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains an inner class, urlHelper, which is defined within the urlTool class. This inner class is not explicitly declared as static, which means it is an instance inner class. As a result, the urlHelper class is translated into a class that is accessible at package scope, potentially exposing code that the programmer intended to keep private to attackers. This is a classic example of CWE-492, where an inner class is not properly encapsulated, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the inner class urlHelper should be declared as static, like this: private static final class urlHelper {...}. This will ensure that the urlHelper class is not accessible at package scope and will prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Alternatively, the urlHelper class could be moved to a separate file, making it a top-level class, which would also achieve the desired level of encapsulation.  ```csharp
private static final class urlHelper {...}
``` or 
```csharp
public class urlHelper {...}
``` in a separate file. ```csharp
urlHelper.java
```
