 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The InnerClass is a static inner class of OuterClass. This means that InnerClass is translated into a class that is accessible at package scope. As a result, the private member variables of OuterClass are exposed to InnerClass, which may allow an attacker to access sensitive information. This is a potential vulnerability as it may allow an attacker to access code that the programmer intended to keep private.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the InnerClass should be made non-static. This will ensure that InnerClass is not translated into a class that is accessible at package scope, and the private member variables of OuterClass will not be exposed to InnerClass. The updated code should look like this:
```java
private class InnerClass {
    //...
}
```VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 476
CWE Description:
NULL Pointer Dereference

Code Sample:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public void myMethod() {
        String str = null;
        if (str!= null) {
            System.out.println(str.length());
        } else {
            System.out.println("String is null");
        }
    }
}
```
