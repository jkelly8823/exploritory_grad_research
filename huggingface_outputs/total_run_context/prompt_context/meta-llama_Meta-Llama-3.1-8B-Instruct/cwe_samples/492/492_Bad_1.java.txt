 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a member inner class named InnerClass. This inner class has access to the private member variables of the OuterClass. This is a potential vulnerability as it may expose code that the programmer intended to keep private to attackers. The inner class can access the private member variables of the outer class, which can lead to unintended behavior or security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the inner class should be declared as static. This will prevent the inner class from accessing the private member variables of the outer class. The corrected code should look like this:
```java
private static class InnerClass {
    //...
}
```
Alternatively, the inner class can be declared as a local class, which will also prevent it from accessing the private member variables of the outer class. The corrected code should look like this:
```java
private void someMethod() {
    class InnerClass {
        //...
    }
}
```VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The code does not properly handle the case where the input to a function is null, leading to a potential NullPointerException.

Code Sample:

```java
