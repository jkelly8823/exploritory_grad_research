 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code has a return statement inside a finally block, which will cause any thrown exception in the try block to be discarded. This is a violation of the principle of exception handling, where exceptions should be caught and handled, rather than being discarded. The return statement in the finally block will override any exception thrown in the try block, making it difficult to diagnose and handle the exception.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the return statement outside the finally block, so that exceptions thrown in the try block can be properly handled.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to catch and handle any exceptions thrown in the try block, rather than discarding them. This will make it easier to diagnose and handle any issues that may arise. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
