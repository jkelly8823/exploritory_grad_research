 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string attack because it uses the snprintf function with a format string that originates from an external source (argv[1]). This allows an attacker to inject malicious format specifiers, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer function like sprintf or snprintf with a fixed format string, or use a function that is immune to format string attacks, such as printf with a fixed format string. Additionally, consider using a library like libformat or a secure coding library to help prevent format string attacks. Also, validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious format specifiers from being injected. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

Code Sample:

                  int main(int argc, char **argv){char buf[128];...snprintf(buf,128,argv[1]);}
