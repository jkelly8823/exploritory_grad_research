 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string attack because it uses the printf function with a format string that originates from an external source (argv[1]). This allows an attacker to inject malicious format specifiers and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like snprintf or sprintf to prevent buffer overflows and format string attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize the input from argv[1] to prevent malicious format specifiers from being injected.
3. Consider using a more secure function like printf with a format string that is not user-controlled, or using a library that provides format string protection. 4. Always use the %s format specifier when printing strings to prevent format string attacks. 5. Use a secure coding practice like using a buffer size that is a multiple of the size of the format specifier. 6. Use a secure coding practice like using a buffer size that is a multiple of the size of the format specifier. 7. Use a secure coding practice like using a buffer size that is a multiple of the size of the format specifier. 8. Use a secure coding practice like using a buffer size that is a
