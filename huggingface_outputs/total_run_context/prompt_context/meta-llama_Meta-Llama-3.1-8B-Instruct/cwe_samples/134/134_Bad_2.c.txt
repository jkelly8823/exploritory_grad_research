 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string attack because the format string originates from an external source. The format string is passed as an argument to the printf function, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the format string is crafted maliciously. In this case, the format string is hardcoded, but in a real-world scenario, it could be obtained from user input or other external sources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like snprintf or sprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent format string attacks.
3. Consider using a secure coding library or framework that provides built-in protection against format string attacks. 
4. Use a format string that is not user-controllable, such as a hardcoded string. 
5. Use a secure function like printf with a secure format string. 
6. Use a secure function like printf with a secure format string and a secure buffer. 7. Use a secure function like printf with a secure format string, a secure buffer, and a secure format specifier. 8. Use a secure function like printf with a secure format string, a secure buffer, a secure format specifier, and
