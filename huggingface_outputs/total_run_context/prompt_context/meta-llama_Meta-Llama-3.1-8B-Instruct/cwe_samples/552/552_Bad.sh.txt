 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to the CWE-552 vulnerability. This is because the `--allow-blob-public-access` flag is set to `true`, which allows public access to blobs in the storage account. This can lead to unauthorized actors accessing sensitive data. The code does not explicitly check for permissions or authentication before updating the storage account settings, making it vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `--allow-blob-public-access` flag or set it to `false` to prevent public access to blobs.
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization checks before updating the storage account settings.
3. Consider using Azure Storage's built-in features, such as Azure Storage Explorer, to manage storage accounts securely.
