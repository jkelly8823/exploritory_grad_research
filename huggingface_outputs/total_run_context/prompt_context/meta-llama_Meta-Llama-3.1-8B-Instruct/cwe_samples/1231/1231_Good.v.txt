 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-1231 vulnerability because it does not prevent the value of the lock bit from being modified after it has been set. The lock bit is set when the JTAG unlock signal is low, but the value of the lock bit is then modified in the following lines of code. This modification can potentially allow unauthorized access to the registers or address regions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to prevent the value of the lock bit from being modified after it has been set. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the lock bit is not modified when the JTAG unlock signal is low. For example, the code can be modified as follows:

always @(posedge clk_i)
    begin
        if(~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock))
            begin
                for (j=0; j < 6; j=j+1) begin
                    if (~jtag_unlock) begin
                        reglk_mem[j] <= 'h0;
                    end
                    else begin
                        // do not modify the lock bit when the JTAG unlock signal is low
