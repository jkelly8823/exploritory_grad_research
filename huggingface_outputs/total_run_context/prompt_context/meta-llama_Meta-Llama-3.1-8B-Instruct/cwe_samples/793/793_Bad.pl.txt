 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-793: Inadequate Filtering Leading to Code Injection vulnerability. The GetUntrustedInput() function is used to retrieve user input, which is then used to construct a file path. However, the input is only filtered to remove consecutive dots (..), but not for any other special characters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious characters into the file path, potentially leading to code injection attacks. For example, an attacker could input a string like "/home/user/../etc/passwd" to access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a proper input validation library to sanitize the user input and remove any special characters that could be used for code injection attacks.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the file path and only allow specific directories and files to be accessed.
3. Consider using a more secure method to construct the file path, such as using a path manipulation library that can handle user input safely. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest security best practices.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 89 CWE Description: Improper Neutral
