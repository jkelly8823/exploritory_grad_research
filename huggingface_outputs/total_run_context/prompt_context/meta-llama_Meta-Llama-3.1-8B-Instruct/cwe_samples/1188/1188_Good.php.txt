 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1188 because it initializes the $authorized variable with a default value of false, which is not secure. This is because an attacker could potentially exploit this default value by manipulating the $_POST['user'] and $_POST['pass'] variables. To fix this, the code should initialize the $authorized variable with a secure default value, such as true, and then set it to false if the login fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the $authorized variable with a secure default value, such as true.
2. Set the $authorized variable to false if the login fails.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle user input, such as using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
