 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a password reset attack. The password reset functionality does not require the original password, allowing an attacker to reset a user's password without knowing the original password. This is a serious security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a password reset functionality that requires the original password or an additional form of authentication, such as a security question or a one-time password.
2. Use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to store passwords securely.
3. Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
4. Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.
