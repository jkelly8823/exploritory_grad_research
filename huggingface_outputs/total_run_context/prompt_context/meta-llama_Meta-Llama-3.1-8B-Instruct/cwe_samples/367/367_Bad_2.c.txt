 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-367 because it checks the state of the file "MYFILE.txt" before using it, but the state of the file can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the file is in an unexpected state. Specifically, the code checks the change time of the file and then uses it to determine which option to print. However, if the file's change time changes between the check and the use, the code may print an incorrect option.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to ensure that the file's state does not change between the check and the use.
2. Use a more robust method to determine the file's state, such as using a file descriptor to check the file's metadata.
3. Avoid using the file's change time to make decisions, and instead use a more reliable method to determine the file's state. For example, you could use the file's size or last access time.
