 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-367 because it checks the write access to a file before attempting to open it in write mode. However, between the check and the open operation, another process may have modified the file's permissions, invalidating the results of the check. This can cause the code to attempt to open the file in write mode even if it no longer has write access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the write access to the file immediately before attempting to open it in write mode. This can be achieved by moving the fopen call inside the if statement. Alternatively, the code can use a more robust method to check the file's permissions, such as using the access function with the R_OK flag to check for read access, and then attempting to open the file in write mode.
