 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-644 because it directly adds untrusted raw input data to the HTTP response header without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to a potential security issue if the untrusted data contains malicious web scripting syntax that can be processed by web browser components.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the untrusted input data before adding it to the HTTP response header.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific, safe characters in the input data.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against web scripting attacks. 
4. If possible, avoid adding user-provided data directly to HTTP headers and instead use a more secure approach, such as including it in the response body.  ```python
def validate_and_sanitize_input(input_data):
    # Implement validation and sanitization logic here
    return sanitized_data

def add_safe_header(response, header_name, safe_data):
    response.addHeader(header_name, safe_data)

# Usage example:
untrustedRawInputData = "malicious script"
safe_data = validate_and_sanitize_input(untrustedRawInputData)
add_safe_header(response, HEADER_NAME
