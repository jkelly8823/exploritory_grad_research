 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-601 because it directly uses the user-controlled input from the URL parameter 'url' in a Redirect without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the redirect URL and potentially perform phishing attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the user input using a whitelist approach to ensure it only accepts expected URLs.
2. Use a function like `filter_var()` to sanitize the input URL and prevent any malicious characters from being injected.
3. Consider using a more secure method for redirects, such as using a session or a secure redirect library.
