 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-780 vulnerability because it uses the RSA algorithm with ECB mode and OAEP padding, but the padding scheme used is "OAEPWithMD5AndMGF1Padding" which is not considered secure. A more secure padding scheme should be used, such as "OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding".
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a more secure padding scheme, such as "OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding".
2. Consider using a more secure mode, such as GCM or EAX, instead of ECB mode. 
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security standards. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product uses a catch block to catch a general exception, which might mask other unexpected errors.

Code Sample:

                  try { // some code here}catch (Exception e) {log("Unexpected error occurred", e);}
