 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-501 because it directly assigns the user input from the request parameter "usrname" to the session attribute without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious data into the session, which could lead to unauthorized access or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the user input using a whitelist approach to ensure it only contains expected characters.
2. Sanitize the user input to remove any unnecessary or malicious characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store user data, such as a secure cookie or a token-based authentication system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a SQL command without proper validation or sanitization of the input, leading to SQL injection.

Code Sample:

                String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + request.getParameter("username") + "'";ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
