 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-501 because it mixes trusted and untrusted data in the same data structure. The variable 'usrname' is obtained from the request object which is untrusted, and it is then stored in the session object which is trusted. This can lead to potential security issues if the untrusted data is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the 'usrname' variable before storing it in the session object. This can be done by using a whitelist approach to validate the input.
2. Consider using a more secure method to store user data, such as using a secure cookie or a token-based authentication system. 
3. Ensure that the session object is properly configured to prevent any potential security issues. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with security best practices.  ```python
