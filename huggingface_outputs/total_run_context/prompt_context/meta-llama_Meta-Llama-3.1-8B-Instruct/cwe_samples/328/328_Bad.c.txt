 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses SHA1, which is a weak hash function that is vulnerable to preimage, second preimage, and birthday attacks. This makes it unsuitable for password storage. The use of SHA1 in this context is a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a more secure hash function like Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt for password storage. Consider using a library like OpenSSL or a password hashing framework like Passlib to handle password hashing securely. Additionally, consider salting the password to make it more resistant to attacks.
