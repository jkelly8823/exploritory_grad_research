 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a preimage attack due to the use of a weak hash function. The hash function used in this code is not suitable for cryptographic purposes, as it can be easily reversed to obtain the original input. This is because the hash function is based on a simple concatenation of the input data with a fixed prefix, which can be easily predicted by an attacker. Additionally, the use of a fixed prefix (60{8'h00}) makes it even easier for an attacker to determine the original input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a cryptographically secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, to produce a digest that meets security expectations.
2. Avoid using fixed prefixes or other predictable values in the hash function.
3. Consider using a more secure method for storing and verifying sensitive data, such as encryption or digital signatures.
