 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
EXPLANATION:
The code uses SHA, which is a weak hash function that is susceptible to preimage, second preimage, and birthday attacks. This is because SHA does not meet the security expectations for a hash function. The code also uses a digest from the password, which is not secure. The use of SHA and the digest from the password makes the code vulnerable to attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure hash function like SHA-256 or SHA-3. Also, use a secure method to store and compare passwords, such as using a salted hash. For example, you can use the PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 function to generate a salted hash. Additionally, consider using a library like BCrypt to handle password storage and comparison securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 328
CWE Description:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to
