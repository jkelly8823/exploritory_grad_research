VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-695 because it uses low-level functionality (opening a socket) that is explicitly prohibited by the framework or specification under which the servlet is supposed to operate. In this case, the servlet is using the low-level socket functionality to connect to a remote server, which is not allowed in a servlet environment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a higher-level API, such as HttpURLConnection, to connect to the remote server.
2. Consider using a library or framework that provides a more secure way to interact with remote servers.
3. If the low-level socket functionality is necessary, ensure that it is properly secured and validated to prevent any potential security risks.  ```java
// Replace the socket code with a higher-level API
URL url = new URL("http://example.com");
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
```  ```java
// Consider using a library or framework that provides a more secure way to interact with remote servers
// For example, use the Apache HttpClient library
```  ```java
// If the low-level socket functionality is necessary, ensure that it is properly secured and validated
