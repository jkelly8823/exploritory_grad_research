 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-695 because it uses the System.loadLibrary() method to load a native library, which is explicitly prohibited by the Java Security Manager. This can lead to security issues if the library is not properly validated or if it contains malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the System.load() method instead of System.loadLibrary() to load the native library, as it provides more control over the loading process.
2. Validate the native library before loading it to ensure it is from a trusted source.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a Java Native Access (JNA) library, to interact with the native library. This can provide better security and flexibility.
