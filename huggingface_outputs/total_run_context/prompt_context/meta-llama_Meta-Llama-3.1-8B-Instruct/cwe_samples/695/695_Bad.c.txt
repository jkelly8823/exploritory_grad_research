 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-695 because it uses the gets() function, which is explicitly prohibited by the C standard. The gets() function is a low-level function that can cause buffer overflows, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. The use of gets() is not allowed in the C standard, and it is recommended to use safer functions like fgets() instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gets() function with fgets() to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer function to handle user input, such as fgets() or scanf(). 
3. Consider using a library that provides a safer way to handle user input, such as the GNU C Library's fgets() function. 
4. Always check the return value of fgets() to ensure that the input was successfully read. 
5. Consider using a more secure way to handle user input, such as using a library that provides a way to validate user input. 
6. Always validate user input to prevent buffer overflows. 
7. Consider using a library that provides a way to handle user input securely, such as the OpenSSL library. 
8. Always use a secure way to handle
