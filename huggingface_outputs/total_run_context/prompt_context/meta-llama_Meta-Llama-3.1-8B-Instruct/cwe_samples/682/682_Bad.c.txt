 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-682 because it performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results. In this case, the calculation is performed by the get_num_imgs() function, which returns the number of images. However, the code does not check if the returned value is valid or if it can be used to allocate memory. If the returned value is negative or too large, it can cause the malloc() function to return a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the return value of get_num_imgs() to ensure it is a positive integer.
2. Check the return value of malloc() to ensure it is not null before using it.
3. Consider using a safer memory allocation function, such as calloc(), which initializes the allocated memory to zero. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The application uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

int x;int y = 5;int z = x + y;
