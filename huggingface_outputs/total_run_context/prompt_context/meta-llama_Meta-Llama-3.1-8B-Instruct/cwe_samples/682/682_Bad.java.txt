 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-682 because it performs integer division, which truncates the decimal part of the result. This can lead to incorrect calculations, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers. In this case, the division of yardsGained by touchdowns will result in an integer value, which may not accurately represent the average yards gained per touchdown.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use floating-point division by casting one of the operands to a floating-point type, such as double. For example: `System.out.println(team.getName() + " averages " + (double)yardsGained / touchdowns + "yards gained for every touchdown scored");` Alternatively, you can use the `Math.round()` method to round the result to the nearest integer. However, this may not be suitable if you need precise calculations. It's also worth noting that using floating-point numbers can introduce other issues, such as precision loss, so it's essential to carefully consider the requirements of your application.  ```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int touchdowns = 10;
        int yardsGained = 100
