 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `strcpy` is used to copy the hostname into the `hostname` buffer. However, the size of the buffer is fixed at 64 characters, which may not be sufficient to hold the hostname. If the hostname is longer than 64 characters, it will overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer function like `strncpy` to copy the hostname into the buffer, and ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the hostname. For example: `strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, sizeof(hostname));hostname[sizeof(hostname)-1] = '\0';` This will prevent the buffer from overflowing and reduce the risk of a buffer overflow attack. Additionally, consider using a more secure function like `snprintf` to format the string and prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations
