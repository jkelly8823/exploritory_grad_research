 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. The function copy_input() allocates a buffer of size 4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE, but it does not check if the user-supplied string is longer than the allocated buffer size. If the user-supplied string is longer than the allocated buffer size, it will overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the user-supplied string against the allocated buffer size before copying the string.
2. Use a safer function like strcpy_s() or strncpy() to copy the string, which can prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a more secure function like strlcpy() or strlcat() to copy the string, which can prevent buffer overflows and provide additional security features. 
4. Always check the return value of malloc() to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. 
5. Consider using a memory sanitizer or a tool like AddressSanitizer to detect buffer overflows at runtime. 
6. Consider using a secure coding standard like MISRA C or CERT C to ensure that the code follows secure coding practices
