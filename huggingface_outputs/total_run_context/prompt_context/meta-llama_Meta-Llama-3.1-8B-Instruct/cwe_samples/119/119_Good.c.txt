 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the index is within the valid range before accessing the array, preventing buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is already secure against this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate the format of input received from the user or from a source external to the product. This could result in the product processing an unexpected input format, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

                     String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
                     // process the user input
                     String processedInput = userInput.trim();
                    ...
