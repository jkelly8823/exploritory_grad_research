 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not check if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array before accessing the array. This can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the array, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure the index is less than the length of the array before accessing the array.
2. Use a safer way to handle the error case, such as returning an error code or throwing an exception instead of printing an error message.
3. Consider using bounds checking libraries or frameworks that can help prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.  VULNERABLE: YES
