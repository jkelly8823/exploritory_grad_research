 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a glitch attack due to the presence of a conditional statement that is sensitive to voltage and clock glitches. The `if (signature_matches)` statement is a single clock cycle, and a glitch in the clock signal can cause the condition to be evaluated incorrectly, leading to an incorrect decision to load the runtime firmware. This is a classic example of a glitch attack, which can be used to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access to the device.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a glitch-resistant design for the conditional statement, such as a dual-rail or latch-based implementation.
2. Add a glitch detection and mitigation circuit to the device to detect and correct any voltage or clock glitches that may occur.
3. Use a secure boot mechanism to ensure that the firmware is loaded correctly and securely. This can include using a secure boot ROM or a trusted execution environment (TEE).
