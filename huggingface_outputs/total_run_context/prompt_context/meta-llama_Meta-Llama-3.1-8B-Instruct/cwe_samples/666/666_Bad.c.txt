 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double-free error. The pointer 'ptr' is freed twice, once in the 'if (abrt)' block and again outside of it. This can lead to unexpected behaviors and crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the second 'free(ptr)' statement to prevent the double-free error.
2. Consider using smart pointers or a memory management library to avoid manual memory management and potential errors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that has been declared but not initialized.

Code Sample:

int x;
if (x > 5) {
    printf("x is greater than 5");
}
printf("x is %d", x);

This concludes your task. Provide your response here: 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 4
EXPLANATION:
The variable 'x' is used in the 'if (x > 5)' condition but is not initialized before that. This can lead to undefined behavior when the program tries to print the value of 'x'.
