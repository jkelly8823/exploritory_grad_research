 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-927 because it uses an implicit intent to transmit sensitive data (username and password) to other applications. This can lead to unauthorized access to the sensitive data. The use of implicit intents can also lead to unexpected behavior, as the receiving application may not be expecting the data and may not handle it correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use explicit intents instead of implicit intents to ensure that the data is transmitted to the intended application.
2. Use a secure method to transmit sensitive data, such as encryption or secure storage.
3. Validate the receiving application's intent filter to ensure that it is expecting the sensitive data. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The code does not properly validate user input, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

Code Sample:

                  String uname_string = request.getParameter("username");String pw_string = request.getParameter("password");if (uname_string.equals("admin") && pw_string.equals("password")){    // login logic} else {    // login failed logic}
