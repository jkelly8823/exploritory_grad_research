 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-378 because it creates a temporary file without proper measures or controls. The file is created with `File.createTempFile()`, but it is not properly cleaned up in case of an exception. Additionally, the file is deleted on exit, but this does not guarantee that the file will be deleted if the program crashes or is terminated abruptly. This can lead to temporary files being left behind, which can be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure that the `BufferedWriter` is properly closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.
2. Use a `File.deleteOnExit()` method to delete the temporary file only when the program exits normally, not when an exception is thrown.
3. Consider using a more secure method to create temporary files, such as `java.nio.file.Files.createTempFile()`, which provides more control over the file's creation and deletion.
