 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-378 because it opens a temporary file using tmpfile() without checking if the file was successfully opened. If tmpfile() fails, it returns NULL, but the code does not handle this case properly. The perror() function is called, but the return value of tmpfile() is not checked before calling perror(). This can lead to a null pointer dereference if tmpfile() fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of tmpfile() before using the file pointer. If tmpfile() returns NULL, handle the error accordingly.
2. Use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when opening the temporary file.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to tmpfile(), such as a library that provides a more secure way to create temporary files. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for the return value of the rmtmp() function, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the function fails.

Code Sample:

                  rmtmp(); // remove tmp file
