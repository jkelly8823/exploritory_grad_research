 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to resource leak because the connection is not properly closed. The line 'conn.Connection.Close();' is incorrect and should be 'conn.Close();'. This is because the 'Close()' method is a part of the 'SqlConnection' class and not 'SqlConnection.Connection'. The correct way to close the connection is by calling 'conn.Close();' after the 'using' block.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a 'using' block to ensure the connection is properly closed. This can be achieved by wrapping the connection and command objects in a 'using' block.
- Replace 'conn.Connection.Close();' with 'conn.Close();'. 
- Remove the 'conn.Connection.Close();' line as it is not necessary. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
