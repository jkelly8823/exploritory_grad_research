 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to resource leaks because the FileReader object is not closed in a finally block. This means that if an exception occurs while reading the file, the FileReader object will not be closed, leading to a resource leak. The fil.Close() statement is not sufficient to ensure that the FileReader object is closed because it is not in a finally block.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the FileReader object in a finally block to ensure that it is always closed, even if an exception occurs. This can be done by using a try-finally block. Here is an example of how to do this: 
try{BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine())!= null){processLine(line);}}finally{fil.Close();}
Alternatively, you can use a using statement to ensure that the FileReader object is closed. Here is an example of how to do this: 
using (BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName))){String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine())!= null){processLine(line);}}
