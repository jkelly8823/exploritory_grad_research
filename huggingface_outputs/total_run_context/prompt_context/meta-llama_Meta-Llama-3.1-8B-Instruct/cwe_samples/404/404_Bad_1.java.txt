EXPLANATION:
The code does not close the database connection after use, which can lead to resource leaks. This is a classic example of CWE-404, where the connection is not released before it is made available for re-use. Although the connection is closed in a finally block, it is not explicitly closed in the try block, which can lead to issues if an exception is thrown before the connection is closed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the database connection in a finally block to ensure it is released after use. This can be achieved by using a try-with-resources statement or by explicitly closing the connection in a finally block. For example:
```java
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string)) {
    // Use the connection
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(e);
}
``` 
Alternatively, you can use a finally block to close the connection:
```java
try {
    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);
    // Use the connection
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(e);
} finally {
    if (con!= null) {
        con.close();
    }
}
``` 
Note that the try-with-resources statement is
