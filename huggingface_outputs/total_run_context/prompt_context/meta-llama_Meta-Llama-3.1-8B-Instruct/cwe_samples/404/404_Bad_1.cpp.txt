 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak because it does not properly handle the case where the 'heap' parameter is true. In this scenario, the code allocates memory on the heap using 'new', but it does not check if the allocation was successful before attempting to delete the memory. If the allocation fails, the program will crash when it tries to delete the memory. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where the 'heap' parameter is false, in which case it attempts to delete memory that was not allocated on the heap. This can also cause the program to crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the result of the 'new' allocation to ensure it was successful before attempting to delete the memory.
2. Use a smart pointer or a container to manage the memory, rather than manual memory management with 'new' and 'delete'.
3. Remove the 'delete' statement when the 'heap' parameter is false, as it is not necessary and can cause a crash.
