EXPLANATION:
The code does not close the BufferReader object after it is used. This can lead to resource leaks if the processFile method is called multiple times. The FileReader object is also not closed. This can lead to file descriptor leaks if the processFile method is called multiple times.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the BufferReader object after it is used. This can be done by calling the Close method on the BufferReader object. The FileReader object should also be closed after it is used. This can be done by calling the Close method on the FileReader object.
