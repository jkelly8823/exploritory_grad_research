 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak because the pointer 'ptr' is deleted, but it was not properly checked for null before deletion. This can lead to a segmentation fault if 'ptr' is null. Additionally, the code does not check the return value of malloc, which can also lead to a resource leak if malloc fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of malloc to ensure it was successful before using the pointer.
2. Check the pointer for null before deleting it to prevent segmentation faults.
3. Use smart pointers or containers to manage memory and avoid manual memory management.
