 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code does not close the file pointer 'f' in case of an error. If an error occurs while opening the file, the file pointer 'f' is not closed, which can lead to a resource leak. This is a classic example of CWE-404.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the file pointer 'f' in the error handling block. This can be done by adding fclose(f) in the if (!f) block. The corrected code should look like this: if (!f) {fclose(f); printf("cannot open %s\n", fName);return DECODE_FAIL;} else {... } 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for buffer overflow when copying data into a fixed-size buffer.

Code Sample:

                  char* copyString(char* str) {
                        char buf[10];strcpy(buf, str);return buf;
                     }
