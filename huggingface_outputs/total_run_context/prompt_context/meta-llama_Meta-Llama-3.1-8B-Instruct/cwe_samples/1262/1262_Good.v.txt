VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to improper access control to memory-mapped I/O registers. The condition `riscv::priv_lvl_t'(priv_lvl_o & csr_addr.csr_decode.priv_lvl)!= csr_addr.csr_decode.priv_lvl` checks if the privilege level of the current instruction is different from the privilege level of the CSR being accessed. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to the CSR. The code should also check if the current instruction has the required privilege level to access the CSR. Additionally, the code does not check if the CSR being accessed is a debug mode only CSR, which can lead to unauthorized access to debug mode functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the current instruction has the required privilege level to access the CSR.
2. Check if the CSR being accessed is a debug mode only CSR and deny access if the debug mode is not enabled.
3. Consider using a more secure method to access memory-mapped I/O registers, such as using a secure access mechanism or a hardware-based access control.  ```c
if (csr_we || csr_read) begin
    // Check if
