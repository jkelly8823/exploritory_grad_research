 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-261 because it uses Base64 decoding to obscure the password, which is a trivial encoding and does not provide sufficient protection. An attacker can easily decode the password using a Base64 decoder. Additionally, the password is stored in a properties file, which is not a secure way to store sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store sensitive information, such as environment variables or a secure key store.
2. Use a more secure method to obscure the password, such as hashing or encryption.
3. Avoid using Base64 decoding for password protection. Instead, use a library that provides secure password handling, such as Apache Commons Codec. 
4. Consider using a more secure way to connect to the database, such as using a connection pool or a secure connection protocol like SSL/TLS. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date.
