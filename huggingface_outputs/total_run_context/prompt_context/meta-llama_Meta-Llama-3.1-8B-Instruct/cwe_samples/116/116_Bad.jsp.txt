 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-116 because it directly outputs the user-provided email parameter without proper encoding or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The <%= %> syntax is used for server-side scripting, which can execute the user-inputted email value as code, rather than treating it as a string.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to encode or escape the user-inputted email value, such as using the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml()` method from the Apache Commons Lang library or the `Html.escape()` method from the Java 8 `java.util.function` package.
2. Consider using a templating engine that supports secure output of user-inputted data, such as FreeMarker or Velocity.
3. Always validate and sanitize user-inputted data to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
