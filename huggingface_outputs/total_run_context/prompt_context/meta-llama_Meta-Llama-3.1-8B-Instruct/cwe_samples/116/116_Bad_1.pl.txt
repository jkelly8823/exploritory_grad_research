 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-116 because it does not properly encode or escape the user input in the $inputString variable. The input is split into two parts ($cmd and $argstr) and then the $argstr is URL encoded. However, the $cmd variable is not encoded or escaped, which can lead to a structured message being sent to the file server with malicious data. This can result in the intended structure of the message not being preserved.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Encode or escape the $cmd variable before sending it to the file server.
2. Use a more secure method to split the input string, such as using a regular expression that matches a specific pattern.
3. Validate the user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 116 CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output for a Different Programming Language or Platform.  The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.  The code is vulnerable to CWE-116 because
