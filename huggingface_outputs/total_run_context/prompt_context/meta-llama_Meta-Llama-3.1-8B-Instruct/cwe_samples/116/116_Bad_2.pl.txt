 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-116 because it does not properly encode or escape the user input in the "doit" function. The "encode" function is used to encode the user input, but it only replaces certain special characters with their corresponding HTML entities. However, it does not account for other types of user input that may contain malicious code, such as JavaScript or SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the "doit" function directly uses the encoded user input in a system call, which can lead to command injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust encoding function that can handle a wider range of special characters and user input types.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure it only contains expected characters.
3. Avoid using system calls directly and instead use a safer alternative, such as a library function or a secure shell.
4. Consider using a templating engine to separate the presentation layer from the business logic and prevent code injection attacks. 5. Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in system calls or other sensitive operations. 6. Consider using a library like "HTML::Escape" to properly
