 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-116 because it does not properly encode or escape the data from the file handle. The input from the file handle is directly used in the split function without any sanitization or encoding. This can lead to a structured message being tampered with or corrupted, potentially causing unintended behavior or security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a proper encoding function, such as `utf8_encode()` or `html_entity_decode()`, to ensure that the input data is properly encoded before using it in the split function.
2. Consider using a more robust method for parsing the input data, such as a dedicated parsing library or a regular expression that accounts for potential encoding issues.
3. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential security issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a string that is used in a format string operation, but the product does not validate the format string or the input to prevent attacks.

Code Sample:

                  $inputString = readLineFromFileHandle($serverFH);
                     
                     # generate an array of strings
