 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does properly acquire and release a lock on the resource. The mutex is locked before accessing the shared resource and unlocked afterwards. This is a correct implementation of a lock.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is correct and does not need any changes. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

Code Sample:

                void f() {
                        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
                           
                           /* access shared resource */
                           
                           
                           pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
                     }

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not properly acquire and release a lock on the resource. The mutex is locked before accessing the shared resource but the mutex pointer is not passed to the function. This will result in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Pass the mutex pointer to the function. The corrected code should be:
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
