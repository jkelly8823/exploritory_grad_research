 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double-checked locking issue. The first check for `helper` being null is not synchronized, which means that multiple threads could potentially see `helper` as null and attempt to create a new instance of `Helper` simultaneously. This could lead to unexpected behavior and resource state changes. The second check for `helper` being null is synchronized, but it's inside the synchronized block, which means it's not necessary and could be removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, you can use the "lazy initialization holder" idiom, which is a thread-safe way to initialize a static variable. Here's an example of how you can refactor the code:

```java
private static class HelperHolder {
    public static Helper helper = new Helper();
}

public Helper getHelper() {
    return HelperHolder.helper;
}
```

This way, the `Helper` instance is created only once, when the class is initialized, and it's thread-safe. Alternatively, you can use the `DoubleCheckedLocking` pattern, but it's more complex and error-prone.
