VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a hardcoded password vulnerability. The password "68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b" is hardcoded in the VerifyAdmin method. This makes it easy for an attacker to obtain the password by reverse engineering the code or by accessing the code directly. Hardcoded passwords should be avoided and replaced with secure methods of authentication, such as storing passwords securely in a database or using a secure password storage mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the hardcoded password and replace it with a secure method of authentication, such as storing passwords securely in a database or using a secure password storage mechanism.
2. Consider using a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or PBKDF2, to store passwords securely.
3. Avoid printing diagnostic messages to the console, as this can reveal sensitive information to an attacker. Instead, consider using a logging mechanism to log diagnostic messages securely. 4. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as rate limiting or IP blocking, to prevent brute-force attacks. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 6.
