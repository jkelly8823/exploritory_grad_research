 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded cryptographic key which is a clear indication of CWE-321. This key is used for password verification, which is a critical security function. Hard-coding a key like this makes it easily accessible to attackers, allowing them to recover encrypted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the cryptographic key, such as environment variables or a secure key management system.
2. Consider using a more secure password verification method, such as hashing and salting the password.
3. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information like cryptographic keys directly in the code. Instead, use a configuration file or a secure storage mechanism. 4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with industry standards. 5. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to further protect against potential vulnerabilities. 6. Use a secure random number generator to generate the cryptographic key. 7. Consider using a password hashing library to handle password storage and verification. 8. Avoid using a fixed-length string for the password, as it may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. 9. Consider
