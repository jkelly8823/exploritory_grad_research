 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a hardcoded key vulnerability. The password "68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b" is hardcoded in the VerifyAdmin function. This makes it easy for an attacker to obtain the key and decrypt the data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store the key, such as environment variables or a secure key store.
2. Use a secure method to compare the password, such as using a password hashing library.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT. 
4. Remove the hardcoded key from the code. 
5. Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks. 
6. Consider implementing a lockout mechanism to prevent repeated failed login attempts. 
7. Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the key. 
8. Consider using a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES. 
9. Consider using a secure protocol, such as HTTPS. 
10. Consider implementing a secure key rotation policy. 
11. Consider using a secure key management system. 
12. Consider using a secure authentication library.
