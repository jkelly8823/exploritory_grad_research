 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to faulty finite state machines (FSMs) due to the lack of a default case in the case statement. This allows the state to be set to an undefined value when the user input is not one of the specified values. This can cause the system to enter an undefined state, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially gain privileges on the victim's system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a default case to the case statement to handle any unexpected user input.
2. Ensure that the state machine is properly designed and tested to prevent any undefined states.
3. Consider using a more robust state machine design, such as a Moore machine or a Mealy machine, to improve the reliability of the system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 1245
CWE Description:
Faulty finite state machines (FSMs) in the hardware logic allow an attacker to put the system in an undefined state, to cause a denial of service (DoS) or gain privileges on the victim's system.  VULNERABLE: YES
