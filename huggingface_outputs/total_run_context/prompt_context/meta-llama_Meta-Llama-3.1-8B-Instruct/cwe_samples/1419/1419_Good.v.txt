 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not attempt to initialize a resource but does not correctly do so. The.REGISTER_DEFAULT value is set to 1225, which is a correct default value to enable Secure_mode. This suggests that the resource is being initialized correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 1419
CWE Description:
The product attempts to initialize a resource but does not correctly do so, which might leave the resource in an unexpected, incorrect, or insecure state when it is accessed.  The code sample provided does not demonstrate this vulnerability.  The.REGISTER_DEFAULT value is set to 1225, which is a correct default value to enable Secure_mode.  This suggests that the resource is being initialized correctly.  Therefore, this vulnerability is not present in the code sample.  However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios.  The code sample provided
