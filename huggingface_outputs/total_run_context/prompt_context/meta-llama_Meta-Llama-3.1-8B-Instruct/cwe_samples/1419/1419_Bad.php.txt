 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to initialize a resource (the user session) but does not correctly do so, which might leave the resource in an unexpected, incorrect, or insecure state when it is accessed. The function login_user() is called but its return value is not checked for errors. If an error occurs during the login process, the $authorized variable will be set to false, but the code does not handle this case. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of the login_user() function and handle any errors that may occur.
2. Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle any exceptions that may be thrown by the login_user() function.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle user authentication, such as using a library or framework that provides built-in authentication functionality.
