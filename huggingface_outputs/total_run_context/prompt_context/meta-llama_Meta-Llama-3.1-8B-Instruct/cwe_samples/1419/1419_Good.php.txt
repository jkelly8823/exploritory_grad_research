 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1419 because it does not correctly initialize the $authorized variable before using it. The variable is set to false initially, but then it is set to true if the login_user function returns true. However, if the login_user function returns false, the $authorized variable will remain false, which might lead to unexpected behavior. To fix this, the code should initialize the $authorized variable to true before the if statement.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the $authorized variable to true before the if statement.
2. Consider using a more secure way to handle user authentication, such as using a library or framework that provides secure authentication mechanisms. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not check for an error condition that can result in a resource leak or other unexpected behavior.

Code Sample:

                  $file = fopen("file.txt", "r");if ($file!== false) {    // do something with the file} else {    // handle the error}
                 ...
