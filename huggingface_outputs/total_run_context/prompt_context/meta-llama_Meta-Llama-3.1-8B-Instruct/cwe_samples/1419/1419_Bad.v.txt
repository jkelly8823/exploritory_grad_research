EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to initialize a resource (register) but does not correctly do so, which might leave the resource in an unexpected, incorrect, or insecure state when it is accessed. This is because the default value of the register is set to an incorrect value (1224) in the Insecure_Device_ID_1 module, and the default value is not defined in the Insecure_Device_ID_2 module, which will use the default value of 2^32-2. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Define the default value of the register correctly in the Insecure_Device_ID_1 module.
2. Define the default value of the register in the Insecure_Device_ID_2 module to ensure it is not using the default value of 2^32-2. 
3. Use a secure default value for the register, such as all zeros or a specific value that is known to be secure. 
4. Consider using a secure initialization mechanism, such as a secure boot process, to ensure the register is initialized correctly. 5. Review the code to ensure that the register is not being
