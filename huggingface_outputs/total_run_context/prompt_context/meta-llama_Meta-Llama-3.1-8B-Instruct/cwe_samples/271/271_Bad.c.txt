 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-271 because it does not drop privileges before passing control of a resource to an actor that does not have those privileges. The chroot function is used to change the root directory to APP_HOME, but it does not change the user's privileges. This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive files or directories outside of the chrooted environment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the setuid function to drop privileges before passing control of the resource to the actor.
2. Use the seteuid function to set the effective user ID to the user ID of the actor, ensuring that the actor has the minimum privileges required to perform the task.
3. Consider using a more secure method to change the root directory, such as using the chroot function with the CHROOT_DETACH flag to detach the process from the original process tree. This can help prevent an attacker from accessing sensitive files or directories outside of the chrooted environment.
