 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-571 because the condition in the else if statement will always evaluate to true. The variable isDelayed is initialized to false and never changed to true. Therefore, the condition isProductAvailable will always be true and the else if statement will always be executed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the else if statement and directly execute the code inside it.
2. Change the condition to check if isDelayed is true before executing the code inside the else if statement. 
3. Initialize isDelayed to true and then set it to false when the product is available. This way, the condition will be executed only when the product is delayed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product contains a function that can be used to bypass security checks.

Code Sample:

                  
                     public void updateInventory(String productNumber) {
                        boolean isProductAvailable = false;boolean isDelayed = false;
                           if (productInStore(productNumber)) {isProductAvailable = true;updateInStoreDatabase(productNumber);}else if (productInWarehouse(productNumber)) {isProductAvailable = true
