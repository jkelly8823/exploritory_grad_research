EXPLANATION:
The DataGlob class stores a non-serializable object as an HttpSession attribute. The DataGlob class itself is not serializable, which can cause issues when the HttpSession is serialized, such as when the session is stored in a database or sent over the network. This can lead to reliability issues and potential errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Make the DataGlob class serializable by implementing the Serializable interface.
2. Alternatively, store only serializable objects in the HttpSession. If the DataGlob class must be stored, consider using a different storage mechanism that does not require serialization, such as a database or a cache. 
3. Consider using a more robust storage mechanism for the HttpSession, such as a distributed cache or a database, to avoid serialization issues altogether. 4. If the DataGlob class is not intended to be stored in the HttpSession, remove the addToSession method. 5. If the DataGlob class is intended to be stored in the HttpSession, consider using a custom HttpSessionListener to handle serialization and deserialization of the DataGlob class. 6. Consider using a more robust framework or library that handles serialization and des
