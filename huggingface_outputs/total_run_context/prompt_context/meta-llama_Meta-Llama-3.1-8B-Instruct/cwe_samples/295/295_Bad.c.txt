VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not validate the certificate correctly. It checks if the verification result is either X509_V_OK or X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN, which is incorrect. X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN is an error code, not a valid verification result. This can lead to a false sense of security and allow malicious certificates to be accepted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Correctly validate the certificate by checking if the verification result is X509_V_OK.
2. Remove the check for X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN, as it is not a valid verification result. 
3. Consider adding additional checks to ensure the certificate is valid and trusted.  ```c
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host) {
    foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if (X509_V_OK == foo) {
        // certificate looks good, host can be trusted
    } else {
        // handle the error
    }
}
