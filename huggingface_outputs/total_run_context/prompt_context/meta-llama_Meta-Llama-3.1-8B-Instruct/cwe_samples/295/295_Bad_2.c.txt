 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-295 because it does not validate the certificate correctly. The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` is an assignment, not a comparison. This means that the value of `cert` will be set to the result of `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))`, but the condition of the if statement will always be true because the assignment will always evaluate to true. This is a classic example of a "dangling else" vulnerability. Additionally, the code does not check for other possible errors that could occur when verifying the certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` to `if (cert == SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)))` to fix the assignment vs comparison issue.
2. Add error checking for other possible errors that could occur when verifying the certificate, such as `X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID` or `X509_V_ERR_CERT_REVOKED`. For example: `if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo) ||
