 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-295 because it does not validate the certificate. The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))` is an assignment, not a comparison. This means that the value of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` is being assigned to `cert`, and the result of the assignment (which is always true) is being used in the if statement. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass certificate validation by setting the `cert` variable to a non-zero value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line to a comparison using `==` instead of `=`. The corrected line should be `if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))`.
2. Consider adding additional validation for the certificate, such as checking its expiration date or verifying its issuer. This can be done using the `X509_get_notBefore()` and `X509_get_notAfter()` functions for expiration date validation, and the `X509_get_issuer()` function for issuer verification.
