 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-295 because it does not validate the certificate correctly. The line "if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))" is an assignment, not a comparison. This means that the value of the certificate is being assigned to the variable "cert" instead of being compared. As a result, the code will always evaluate to true, regardless of whether a valid certificate is present or not.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line to a comparison by replacing the single equals sign (=) with a double equals sign (==). The corrected line should be "if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))".
2. Consider adding additional validation to ensure that the certificate is valid and trusted. This can be done by checking the return value of SSL_get_verify_result(ssl) and verifying that it equals X509_V_OK. The corrected code should be "if (X509_V_OK==SSL_get_verify_result(ssl))".
