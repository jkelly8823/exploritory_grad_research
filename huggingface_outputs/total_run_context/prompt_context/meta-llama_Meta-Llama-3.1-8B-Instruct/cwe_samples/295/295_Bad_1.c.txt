 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not validate the certificate correctly. It checks if the certificate is not null and if the verification result is X509_V_OK, but it does not check if the certificate is trusted or if the verification result is X509_V_ERR_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED, X509_V_ERR_CERTIFICATE_NOT_YET_VALID, etc. This can lead to a false sense of security.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use SSL_get_peer_cert_info() to get the certificate information and check if the certificate is trusted.
2. Use SSL_get_verify_result() to get the verification result and check for specific error codes like X509_V_ERR_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED, X509_V_ERR_CERTIFICATE_NOT_YET_VALID, etc.
3. Consider using a more secure method to verify the certificate, such as using a certificate authority or a trusted certificate store.
