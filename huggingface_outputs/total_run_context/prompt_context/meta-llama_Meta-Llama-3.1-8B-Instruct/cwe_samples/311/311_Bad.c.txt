 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code does not encrypt sensitive information before storage or transmission. The password is being written to the file descriptor 'dfd' without any encryption. This is a potential security risk as sensitive information can be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure encryption method such as AES to encrypt the password before writing it to the file descriptor. This can be achieved by using a library such as OpenSSL. Additionally, ensure that the encryption key is properly generated and stored securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for the return value of the function 'gethostbyname' before using the result.

Code Sample:

                  server.sin_family = AF_INET; hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);if (hp==NULL) error("Unknown host");memcpy( (char *)&server.sin_addr,(char *)hp->h_addr,hp->h_length);if (argc < 3) port = 80;else port = (unsigned short)atoi(argv[3]);server.sin_port = htons(port);if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof
