 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-311 because it sends sensitive information (the URL "http://www.secret.example.org/") over an unencrypted connection. This is a potential security risk as an attacker could intercept the request and access the sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt the connection. This can be achieved by changing the URL to "https://www.secret.example.org/".
2. Consider using a secure protocol for the PUT request, such as SSL/TLS. This can be achieved by using a library that supports secure connections, such as OkHttp or Apache HttpClient. 
3. Always handle exceptions properly to prevent sensitive information from being logged or exposed. This can be achieved by logging the exception message and stack trace without including sensitive information. 4. Consider using a secure way to store and transmit sensitive information, such as encryption or secure storage.
