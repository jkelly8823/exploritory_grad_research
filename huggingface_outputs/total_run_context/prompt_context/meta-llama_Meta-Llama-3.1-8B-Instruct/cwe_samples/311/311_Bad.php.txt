 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-311 because it stores sensitive information (password) in a cookie without encryption. This makes it possible for an attacker to intercept the cookie and gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure encryption method, such as AES, to encrypt the sensitive information before storing it in the cookie.
2. Consider using a more secure method of storing sensitive information, such as a secure token or a database.
3. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
