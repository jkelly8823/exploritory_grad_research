 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unintended access to the specified bucket due to the use of gsutil iam get command. This command retrieves the IAM policy for the specified bucket, which may include permissions that allow unintended actors to read or modify the bucket. The bucket name is hardcoded, which makes it easier for an attacker to identify and target the bucket.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the bucket name, such as environment variables or a secrets manager.
2. Limit the permissions of the IAM policy to only allow necessary access to the bucket.
3. Regularly review and update the IAM policy to ensure it remains secure. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to manage access to the bucket, such as using a service account or a custom role.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
