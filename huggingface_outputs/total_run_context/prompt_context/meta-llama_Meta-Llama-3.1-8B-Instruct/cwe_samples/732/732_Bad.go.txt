 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-732 because the permissions of the admin file are set to 0440, which allows the file to be read by the owner and group, but not written to. However, the file is created with the default permissions of the user who created it, which may not be secure. This allows unintended actors to read or modify the file if they have access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the os.Mkdir function to create the directory with the correct permissions.
2. Use the os.Chmod function to set the permissions of the file to 0440 after it has been created.
3. Consider using a more secure method to create the file, such as using a library that handles file permissions securely.

                        if err!= nil {
                        
                           return err
                        
                        }
                        return nil
                  }
