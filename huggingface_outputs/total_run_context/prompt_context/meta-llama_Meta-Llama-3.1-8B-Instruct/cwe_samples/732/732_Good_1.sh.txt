VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-732 because it sets the permissions of a Google Cloud Storage bucket to allow all users to read and modify it. This is a security risk because it allows unauthorized users to access and modify the bucket's contents.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `gsutil iam ch` command with the `-d` option to set the permissions of the bucket to a more restrictive level, such as `gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME`.
2. Consider using a service account to manage access to the bucket, rather than setting permissions to allow all users to access it.
3. Regularly review and update the bucket's permissions to ensure they remain secure. 4. Consider using a more secure storage solution, such as Cloud Storage's default bucket permissions. 5. Use IAM policies to control access to the bucket. 6. Use Cloud Storage's default bucket permissions. 7. Use IAM roles to control access to the bucket. 8. Use Cloud Storage's default bucket permissions. 9. Use IAM policies to control access to the bucket. 10. Use Cloud Storage's default
