 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to the CWE-732 vulnerability. This is because the "roles/storage.legacyBucketReader" role is assigned to "allUsers", which is a broad permission that allows anyone to read the bucket. This is a security risk because it allows unintended actors to read the bucket's contents.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should restrict the "roles/storage.legacyBucketReader" role to a more specific permission, such as a service account or a group of users who need to read the bucket. You can do this by replacing "allUsers" with a more specific member, such as "serviceAccount:PROJECT-ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com". Additionally, you should review the permissions for the "roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner" role to ensure that it is not too permissive.
