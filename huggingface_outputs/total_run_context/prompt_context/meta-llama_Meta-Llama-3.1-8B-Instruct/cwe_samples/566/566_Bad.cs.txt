VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-566 because it uses a database table that includes records that should not be accessible to an actor, but it executes a SQL statement with a primary key that can be controlled by that actor. The primary key is passed as a parameter to the SQL query, but it is first converted from a string to an integer, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is because the conversion from string to integer does not perform any validation or sanitization of the input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries with parameterized values to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize the input before passing it to the SQL query.
3. Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract the database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks. 
4. Ensure that the database table is properly configured to restrict access to sensitive records. 
5. Regularly review and update the database schema and access controls to prevent unauthorized access. 6. Consider implementing additional security measures such as row-level security or access control lists to further restrict access to sensitive records. 7. Use a
