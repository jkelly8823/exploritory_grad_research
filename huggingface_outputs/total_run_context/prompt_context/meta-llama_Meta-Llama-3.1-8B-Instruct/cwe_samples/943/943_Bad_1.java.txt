 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XPath injection attacks. The XPath expression is constructed by concatenating user input (login.getUserName() and login.getPassword()) without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the XPath expression to access or modify sensitive data in the database by injecting malicious XPath syntax.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a parameterized XPath expression to prevent injection attacks. This can be achieved by using the `evaluate()` method with a `String` parameter, which will be treated as a literal value.
2. Use a library like Apache Commons Lang to properly escape special characters in the user input before concatenating them into the XPath expression.
3. Consider using a more secure data access mechanism, such as a ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, to reduce the risk of SQL or XPath injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not properly validate user-controlled input for SQL syntax.

Code Sample:

               String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE login = '" + login.getUserName() + "'
