 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-943 because it directly concatenates user input (address) into a search filter string without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious characters that can modify the intended logic of the query, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a prepared statement or parameterized query to separate user input from the search filter string.
2. Use a library or framework that provides input validation and sanitization, such as OWASP ESAPI.
3. Validate and sanitize the address input before concatenating it into the search filter string. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not properly validate user input for a query parameter.

Code Sample:

               String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'";ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery(query);
