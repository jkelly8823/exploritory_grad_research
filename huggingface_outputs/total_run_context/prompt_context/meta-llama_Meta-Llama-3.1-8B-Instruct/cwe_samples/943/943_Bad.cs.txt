 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The user input from `ItemName.Text` is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries or stored procedures to separate the SQL code from the user input.
2. Use a library or framework that supports prepared statements, such as ADO.NET's `SqlCommand` with `Parameters`.
3. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious characters from being injected into the query.
