 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code includes a file named 'database.inc' which is likely to contain sensitive information such as database credentials. Storing this file under the web document root with a file extension that is not specifically handled by the server (in this case, a PHP file) makes it accessible via a direct HTTP request, potentially exposing sensitive information. This is a classic example of a "sensitive data exposure" vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the 'database.inc' file to a location outside of the web document root, such as a directory like '/etc' or '/config'.
2. Use a configuration file format that is not executable, such as a JSON or XML file, to store sensitive information.
3. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store and manage sensitive information. 
4. Ensure that the web server is configured to not serve files with a.inc extension. 
5. Consider using a secure way to store and manage database credentials, such as using a secrets manager.
