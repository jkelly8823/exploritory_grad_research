 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-433 because it stores the database password in plain text under the web document root. This allows an attacker to access the password by accessing the PHP file directly, potentially leading to unauthorized database access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store the database password securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure configuration file.
2. Remove the PHP file from the web document root to prevent direct access.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and manage database credentials.
