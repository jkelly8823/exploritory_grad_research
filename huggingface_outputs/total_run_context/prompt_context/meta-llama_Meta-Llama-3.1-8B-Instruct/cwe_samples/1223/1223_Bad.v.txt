 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1223 due to the use of a write-once register. The register is programmable by an untrusted software component earlier than the trusted software component, resulting in a race condition issue. The vulnerability is present in the line where the Data_out is written to after the first write operation. This is because the Data_out is not properly masked to prevent the untrusted software component from writing to it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the Data_out should be properly masked to prevent the untrusted software component from writing to it. This can be achieved by adding a mask to the Data_out assignment, for example: Data_out <= Data_in & 16'hFFFF; This will ensure that the untrusted software component cannot write to the Data_out register. Additionally, the Write_once_status should be properly synchronized to prevent the race condition issue. This can be achieved by using a proper synchronization mechanism, such as a flip-flop.
