 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-210 because it includes sensitive information in the error message. The error message "Bad hacker!" and "Error: $filename does not exist" contain information that could potentially be used by an attacker to gain insight into the system. This is a security risk because it could allow an attacker to gather information about the system's configuration and potentially exploit it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a generic error message that does not include sensitive information. For example, "Invalid input" or "Error accessing file".
2. Consider using a logging mechanism to record the error messages and sensitive information, rather than including it in the error message.
3. Use a secure method to handle user input, such as sanitizing or validating it before using it in the code. This would prevent the code from being vulnerable to CWE-22 and CWE-78. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input without proper validation as part of its input validation routine.

Code Sample:

                  $uname = GetUserInput("username");
                     
                     
                     # avoid CWE-22, CWE
