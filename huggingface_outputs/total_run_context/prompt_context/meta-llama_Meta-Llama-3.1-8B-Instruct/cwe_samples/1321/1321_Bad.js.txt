VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The function setValueByPath is vulnerable to prototype pollution. This is because it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype. When the function is called with a path that includes a property that does not exist in the object, it will create a new property on the object's prototype. This can lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the object being modified is not the prototype of another object. You can do this by checking if the object has a constructor property that is not the same as the constructor of the object being modified. If it does, you can throw an error or return an error message. Additionally, you can use Object.create(null) to create a new object that does not have a prototype, which can help prevent prototype pollution. Here is an example of how you can modify the function to fix this vulnerability:

```javascript
function setValueByPath (object, path, value) {
    const pathArray = path.split(".");
    const attributeToSet = pathArray.pop();
    let objectToModify = Object.create(null);
    for (const
