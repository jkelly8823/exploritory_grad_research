VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The function setValueByPath is vulnerable to prototype pollution. This is because it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype. The function allows an attacker to set arbitrary properties on the object prototype by passing a specially crafted path. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the path to ensure it does not contain any reserved words like "__proto__", "constructor", or "prototype".
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific attributes to be set on the object prototype.
3. Consider using a library like Lodash's `set` function, which is designed to safely set values on objects without allowing prototype pollution.
