 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not explicitly contain any validation fields that do not appear in the associated form. However, the presence of a field named "scale" with a dependency of "integer" suggests that the validation logic may be outdated, as it does not appear to be directly related to the date range validation. This could potentially indicate that the validation logic is out of date, as described in CWE-110.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the validation logic to ensure it accurately reflects the requirements of the form.
2. Consider removing or reconfiguring the "scale" field to ensure it is properly validated and does not indicate outdated validation logic.
3. Verify that all fields in the form are properly validated and that the validation logic is up-to-date.
