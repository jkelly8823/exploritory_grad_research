 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-110 because the validation fields (startDate and endDate) are not present in the form they are associated with. This indicates that the validation logic is out of date and may not be accurate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the form to include the validation fields (startDate and endDate).
2. Ensure that the validation logic is updated to reflect the new form fields.
