 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization. The `functionString` variable is directly used to make data available back in the web view without any checks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the `writeDataToView` method is not shown, but it's likely that it's vulnerable to XSS as well.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `functionString` variable before using it to make data available in the web view.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the `writeDataToView` method.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed functions or using a library that provides XSS protection.
