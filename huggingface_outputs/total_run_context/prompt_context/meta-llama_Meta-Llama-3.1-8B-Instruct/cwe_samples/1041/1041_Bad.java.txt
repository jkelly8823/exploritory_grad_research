 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 16
EXPLANATION:
The code contains duplicated code in the two if conditions. The condition r > 0.0 and r > 1.0 are not mutually exclusive, and the code inside the if blocks are identical. This is a case of duplicated code, which can lead to bugs and make the code harder to maintain.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicated code by extracting it into a separate method.
2. Simplify the conditions to make them more readable and maintainable.
3. Consider using a switch statement or a more advanced data structure to handle different cases.
