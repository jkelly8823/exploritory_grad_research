 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 16
EXPLANATION:
The code contains duplicate code in the main method. The ComplexMath function is called twice with the same parameters, which is unnecessary and can be optimized. This is an example of a code smell known as duplicated code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the duplicated code by calling the ComplexMath function only once. The corrected code should look like this:
```java
public class Main {
   private double ComplexMath(double r, double s) {
      //complex math equations
      double pi = Math.PI;
      double surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
      return surface_area;
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      double s = 10.0;
      double r = 1.0;
      double surface_area;
      if(r > 0.0) {
         surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
      }
   }
}
