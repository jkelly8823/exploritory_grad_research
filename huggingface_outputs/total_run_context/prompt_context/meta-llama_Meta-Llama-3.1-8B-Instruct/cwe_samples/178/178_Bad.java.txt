EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to a case-insensitive regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. The `replaceAll` method is used with a regular expression that matches "script" in a case-insensitive manner, which can lead to a denial of service if the input string contains a large number of "script" substrings. This is because the regular expression engine will have to iterate over the entire input string to find all matches, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^m), where n is the length of the input string and m is the number of "script" substrings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more efficient regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the `java.util.regex.Pattern` class, which supports case-insensitive matching and has a more efficient algorithm for handling large input strings.
2. Use a more specific regular expression that matches only the exact string "script" in a case-sensitive manner, rather than relying on the `replaceAll` method's case-insensitive matching.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides a more robust and efficient way to handle XSS prevention, such as OWASP's ESAPI
