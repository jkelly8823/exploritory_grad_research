EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cookie tampering attack. The cookie "role" is being directly accessed and its value is being assigned to the userRole variable without any validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the userRole variable by modifying the "role" cookie.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the cookie value before assigning it to the userRole variable. This can be done by checking if the cookie value matches a predefined expected value or by verifying it against a database.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the userRole variable, such as using a session or a secure cookie.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to authenticate users.
