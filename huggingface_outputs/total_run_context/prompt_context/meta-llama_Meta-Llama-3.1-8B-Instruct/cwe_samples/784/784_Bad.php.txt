VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cookie tampering attack. The cookie "authenticated" is set based on the result of the AuthenticateUser function, but it is not validated on subsequent requests. An attacker could potentially modify the cookie to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the cookie on each request by checking its value against the expected value.
2. Use a secure method to store and transmit the cookie, such as HTTPS.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as token-based authentication.
