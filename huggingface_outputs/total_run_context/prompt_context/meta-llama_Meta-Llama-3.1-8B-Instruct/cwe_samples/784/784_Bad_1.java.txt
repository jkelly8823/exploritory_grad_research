VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cookie tampering attack. An attacker can manipulate the "authenticated" cookie to gain unauthorized access to the application. The code relies on the existence and value of the cookie, but it does not properly validate the cookie's origin or ensure that it is set by the server. This allows an attacker to set the cookie themselves and gain access to the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags when setting the cookie to prevent JavaScript access and ensure the cookie is transmitted over a secure protocol.
2. Validate the cookie's origin by checking the `Set-Cookie` header to ensure it was set by the server.
3. Use a secure random number generator to generate the cookie's value to prevent predictable values.
4. Implement a secure cookie validation mechanism, such as using a digital signature or a secure hash, to ensure the cookie's integrity.
