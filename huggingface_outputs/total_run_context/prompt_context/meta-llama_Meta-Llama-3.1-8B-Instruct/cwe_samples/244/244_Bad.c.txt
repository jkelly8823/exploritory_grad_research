 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-244 because it uses realloc() to resize the buffer that stores sensitive information. The sensitive information is not removed from memory after the reallocation, leaving it exposed to attack. The realloc() function does not remove the original contents of the buffer, it only allocates new memory and copies the contents to the new location. Therefore, the original contents of the buffer, which contain sensitive information, are still present in memory after the reallocation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure function like realloc_secure() or a similar function that securely removes the sensitive information from memory after reallocation.
2. Use a memory sanitizer or a tool that detects memory leaks to identify and fix any potential memory leaks in the code.
3. Consider using a secure coding library or framework that provides secure memory management functions.  ```python
def scrub_memory(buffer, size):
    # Use a secure function to remove sensitive information from memory
    # For example, use a function that securely overwrites the memory with zeros
    secure_erase(buffer, size)
    
def secure_erase(buffer, size):
    # Securely overwrite the memory with zeros
