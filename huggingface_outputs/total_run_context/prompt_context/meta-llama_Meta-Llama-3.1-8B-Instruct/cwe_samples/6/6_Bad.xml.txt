 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-6 because the session ID length is set to 8 bytes, which is insufficient. This can allow an attacker to brute-force the session ID and gain unauthorized access to the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Increase the session ID length to at least 128 bits (16 bytes) to prevent brute-force attacks. This can be done by changing the value of the "idLengthBytes" property to 16. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures such as IP blocking and rate limiting to further protect the application.  Consider using a more secure session management mechanism, such as using a secure random number generator to generate session IDs.
