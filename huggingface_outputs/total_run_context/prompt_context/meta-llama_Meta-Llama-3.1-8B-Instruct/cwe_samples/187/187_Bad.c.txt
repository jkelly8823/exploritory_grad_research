 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-187 because it only examines a portion of the password before determining whether there is a match. The function AuthenticateUser() uses the strncmp() function to compare the input password with the hardcoded password. However, the strncmp() function only compares the first n characters of the two strings, where n is the length of the shorter string. This means that if the input password is longer than the hardcoded password, the comparison will only examine the first n characters of the input password, potentially leading to a false match.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a function that can compare two strings without truncating them, such as strcmp() or strcasecmp().
2. Use a more secure method of authentication, such as hashing and salting the password.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure authentication functionality.
