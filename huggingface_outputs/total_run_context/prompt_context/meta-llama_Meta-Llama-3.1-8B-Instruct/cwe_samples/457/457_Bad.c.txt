 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-457 because the variables 'aN' and 'bN' are not initialized before being used in the switch statement. The switch statement does not cover all possible values of 'ctl', and when 'ctl' is not one of the specified values, the variables 'aN' and 'bN' will be assigned the value of '-1' which is not initialized. This can lead to unpredictable results when the'repaint(aN, bN)' function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the variables 'aN' and 'bN' before using them in the switch statement.
2. Add a default case to the switch statement to handle all possible values of 'ctl'.
3. Use a more robust method to handle the default case, such as throwing an exception or returning an error code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The code uses a function that is not thread-safe, leading to potential concurrency issues.

Code Sample:

                  int aN, Bn;switch (ctl) {
                        case -1:aN = 0;bN =
