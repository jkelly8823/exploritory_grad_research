EXPLANATION:
The variable test_string is being used before it is initialized. The variable is initialized with the string "Done at the beginning" but then reassigned to "Hello World!" if the condition is met. However, if the condition is not met, the variable remains uninitialized and the printf function will print garbage values or crash the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the variable test_string before using it. This can be done by moving the initialization to before the if statement or by initializing it with a default value. For example:
char *test_string = "Default Value";
if (i!= err_val)
{
test_string = "Hello World!";
}
printf("%s", test_string); 
Alternatively, you can also use a safer approach by using a pointer to a string literal and avoiding the reassignment of the pointer. For example:
const char *test_string = "Done at the beginning";
if (i!= err_val)
{
test_string = "Hello World!";
}
printf("%s", test_string); 
However, this approach will still cause issues if the pointer is reassigned to a string that is not a string literal. A better approach would be to use a
