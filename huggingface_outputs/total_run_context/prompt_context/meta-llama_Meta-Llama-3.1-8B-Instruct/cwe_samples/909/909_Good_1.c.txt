 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code does not initialize the test_string variable when i equals err_val. This is a potential vulnerability because the printf function will attempt to print a null pointer, which can cause a segmentation fault.
RECOMMATIONS:
Initialize the test_string variable before the if statement. This can be done by setting it to a default value, such as an empty string. For example: char *test_string = "";
