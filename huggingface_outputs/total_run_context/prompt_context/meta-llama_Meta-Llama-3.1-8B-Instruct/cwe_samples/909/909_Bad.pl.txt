 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-909 because it does not initialize the $state variable before using it. The GetStateData function is called without checking if the $username is valid or if the function returns a value. This can lead to a null pointer dereference or other unexpected behavior if the function fails to return a value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the $state variable before using it. This can be done by setting it to an empty string or an array.
2. Check the return value of the GetStateData function to ensure it is not null or empty before using it.
3. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may be thrown by the GetStateData function.
