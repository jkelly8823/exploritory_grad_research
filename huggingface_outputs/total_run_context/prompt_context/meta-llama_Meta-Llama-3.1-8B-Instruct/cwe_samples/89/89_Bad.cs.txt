VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly concatenates user input (userName and ItemName.Text) into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the user input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection attacks. In this case, you can use the SqlCommand object with parameterized queries. For example: string query = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = @userName AND itemname = @itemName"; SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@userName", userName); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@itemName", ItemName.Text); sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);.... This way, the user input is treated as a parameter and not as part of the SQL command, preventing SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to further reduce the risk of SQL injection.
