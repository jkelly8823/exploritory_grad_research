 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The user input from the cookie is not properly sanitized and is directly used in the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the cookie value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate and sanitize the user input before using it in the SQL query.
3. Consider using a more secure database library like PDO or MySQLi, which provides better protection against SQL injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

                  $username = trim($username);
                  $password = trim($password);
                  $username = substr($username, 0, 20);
                  $password = substr($password, 0, 20);
                  $username = preg_replace("/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/",
