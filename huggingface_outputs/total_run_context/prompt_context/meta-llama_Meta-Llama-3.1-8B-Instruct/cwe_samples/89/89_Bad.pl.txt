 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The allowList function may prevent some malicious input, but it is not a reliable method for preventing SQL injection. The use of parameterized queries or prepared statements is a more secure approach.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use PDO to prepare the query and bind the user input as a parameter. This will ensure that the user input is treated as literal input and not as part of the SQL command. Here is an example of how to use PDO to prepare the query: 
```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO last_names VALUES(:userKey, :name)");
$stmt->bindParam(':userKey', $userKey);
$stmt->bindParam(':name', $name);
$stmt->execute();
