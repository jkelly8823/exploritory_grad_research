 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a lock cmpxchg8b instruction, which is a specific combination of processor instructions that can lead to undesirable behavior such as locking the processor until a hard reset is performed. This is a classic example of a "lock" instruction, which is a type of instruction that can cause a processor to become unresponsive until the instruction is completed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Avoid using the lock cmpxchg8b instruction unless absolutely necessary. If possible, consider using alternative instructions or algorithms that do not rely on this instruction. If the instruction is necessary, ensure that it is properly synchronized and that the processor is not left in an unresponsive state for an extended period of time. Consider using a retry mechanism to handle cases where the instruction fails to complete. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not properly synchronize access to shared resources, leading to potential data corruption or other concurrency-related issues.

Code Sample:
int x = 0;
void thread1() {
    while (x < 10) {
        x++;
    }
}
void thread2() {
    while (x <
