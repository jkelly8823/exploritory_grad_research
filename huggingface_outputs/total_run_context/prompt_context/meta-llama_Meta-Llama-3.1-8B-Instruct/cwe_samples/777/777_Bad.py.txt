 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the validate_ip_regex function is not anchored, which means it may match substrings of the input string rather than the entire string. This could potentially allow malicious or malformed data to slip through. The regular expression should be anchored to the start and end of the string to ensure it only matches the entire string.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Anchor the regular expression to the start and end of the string by adding ^ and $ to the pattern. For example: r"^((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}$"
2. Consider using a more robust IP address validation library or function to handle edge cases and ensure accurate validation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 200
CWE Description:
The code uses the subprocess module to execute the ping command, but it does not properly handle the output of the command. This could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if the command output is large.

Code Sample:

		
		  import subprocess
		  import re
		  
		  def validate_ip_regex(ip
