 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to predictable initialization vector (IV) attacks. The IV is hardcoded to all zeros, which is not unpredictable or unique. This can allow an attacker to exploit the weakness of the IV and potentially decrypt the encrypted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Generate a random IV for each encryption operation. This can be done using a SecureRandom instance.
2. Store the IV along with the encrypted data, so it can be used for decryption.
3. Consider using a mode of operation that does not require an IV, such as ECB mode. However, this may not be suitable for all use cases due to the potential for block cipher block size limitations.
