 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to predictable initialization vector (IV) attacks. The IV is initialized with all zeros, which is not sufficient for a CBC mode encryption. A predictable IV can allow an attacker to decrypt the encrypted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate the IV, such as RAND_bytes() with a sufficient length.
2. Use a secure method to initialize the IV, such as using a random number generator or a secure random number generator.
3. Consider using a mode of operation that does not require an IV, such as GCM or EAX. 
4. If using CBC mode, use a secure method to generate the IV, such as using a random number generator or a secure random number generator. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses a key, but the product does not generate keys that are sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			
Code Sample:

			      char key[EVP_MAX_KEY_LENGTH];RAND_bytes(key, EVP_MAX_KEY_LENGTH);
