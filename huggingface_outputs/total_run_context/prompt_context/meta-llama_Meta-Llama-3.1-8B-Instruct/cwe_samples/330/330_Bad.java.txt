 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-330 because it uses a predictable random number generator. The seed for the Random object is set to the current time, which is not unpredictable and can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can lead to predictable and reproducible random numbers being generated, which can compromise the security of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) instead of the Random class. The SecureRandom class in Java is a good example of a CSPRNG.
2. Avoid using the current time as a seed for the random number generator. Instead, use a truly random source of entropy, such as the /dev/urandom file on Unix-like systems or the CryptGenRandom function on Windows.
3. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to generate random numbers, such as the RandomStringUtils class in the Apache Commons Lang library.
