 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-1232 vulnerability because it uses a register lock bit protection mechanism that disables changes to system configuration once the bit is set. However, the code does not properly handle power state transitions, which can cause the system configuration to become changeable after power state transitions (e.g., Entry and wake from low power sleep modes). Specifically, the code does not reset the register lock bits after power state transitions, which can lead to unintended changes to the system configuration.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a reset mechanism to reset the register lock bits after power state transitions.
2. Use a more robust mechanism to protect the system configuration, such as using a secure boot process or a hardware-based protection mechanism. 
3. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles all possible power state transitions and system configuration changes. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 1232
CWE Description:
Register lock bit protection disables changes to system configuration once the bit is set. Some of the protected registers or lock bits become programmable after power state transitions (e.g., Entry and wake from low power sleep modes) causing the
