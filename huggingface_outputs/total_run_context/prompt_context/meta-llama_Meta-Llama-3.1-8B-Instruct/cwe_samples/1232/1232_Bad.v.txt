 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-1232 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the register lock bit protection. The condition `~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock && ~rst_9)` is not sufficient to prevent changes to system configuration after power state transitions. The `reglk_mem` array is being cleared in this block, which could potentially allow changes to system configuration.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle the register lock bit protection. This can be achieved by adding additional checks to ensure that the system configuration is not changeable after power state transitions. One possible solution is to add a flag to indicate whether the system is in a power state transition, and only clear the `reglk_mem` array when this flag is not set. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all protected registers or lock bits are properly handled. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE-1232: Register lock bit protection disables changes to system configuration once the bit is set. Some of the protected registers or lock bits become programmable after power state transitions (e.g., Entry and wake from
