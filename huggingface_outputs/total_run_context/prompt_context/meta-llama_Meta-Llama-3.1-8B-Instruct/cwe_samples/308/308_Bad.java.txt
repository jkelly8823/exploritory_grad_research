 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-308 because it uses single-factor authentication. The password is hashed using SHA, but it is not compared with a stored hash using a secure method. The use of the `digest()` method on the `password` object is not secure as it does not provide any protection against timing attacks. Additionally, the `secret_password()` method is not shown, but it is likely that it returns a hardcoded password or a password stored in plaintext, which is a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to compare the hashed password with the stored hash, such as using a constant-time comparison function.
2. Use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive to prevent brute-force attacks.
3. Store passwords securely, such as using a password hashing library or a secure key-value store. 
4. Consider implementing dual-factor authentication to provide an additional layer of security.
