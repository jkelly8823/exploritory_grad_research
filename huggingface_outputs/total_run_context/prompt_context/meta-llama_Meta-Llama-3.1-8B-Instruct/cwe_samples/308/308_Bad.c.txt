 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a single-factor authentication attack. The function check_passwd() uses a simple SHA1 digest to verify the user's password. This is a single-factor authentication scheme, which can be easily compromised by an attacker. The use of a simple hash function like SHA1 is also a concern, as it can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Furthermore, the function does not appear to be using any additional security measures, such as salting or key stretching, to make the password verification process more secure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a dual-factor authentication scheme to provide an additional layer of security.
2. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm, such as Argon2 or PBKDF2, to make the password verification process more resistant to brute-force attacks.
3. Consider using a salt value to make the password hashing process more secure.
4. Implement key stretching to slow down the password verification process and make it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
