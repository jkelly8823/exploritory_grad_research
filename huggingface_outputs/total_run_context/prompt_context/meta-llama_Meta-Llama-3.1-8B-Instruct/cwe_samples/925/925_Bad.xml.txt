 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to the CWE-925: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability. This is because the ShutdownReceiver is not properly verifying the source of the Intent it receives. An attacker could potentially send a malicious Intent to the ShutdownReceiver, causing it to perform unintended actions. This could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, such as consuming system resources or causing the device to shut down unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the ShutdownReceiver should be modified to properly verify the source of the Intent it receives. This can be done by checking the Intent's signature or the sender's identity. For example, the receiver could check if the Intent was sent by the system or a trusted application. Additionally, the receiver could also check the Intent's action and category to ensure it matches the expected values. Here is an example of how the modified receiver could look like:
```java
public class ShutdownReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        if (intent.getAction().equals("android.intent.action.ACTION_SHUTDOWN") && 
            intent.getSender().getPackageName().equals("android")) {
            // Perform shutdown
