 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code includes a script tag that loads a JavaScript file from an external domain, which could potentially grant total access and control of the product to the untrusted source. This is a classic example of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically CWE-830.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to specify which domains are allowed to load scripts. Alternatively, you can use a library like jQuery to load the external script in a way that prevents XSS attacks. Additionally, ensure that the external script is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any malicious code from being executed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user input, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or other security issues.

Code Sample:

                  <?php
$login = $_POST['login'];
$password = $_POST['password'];
if ($login == 'admin' && $password == 'password') {
    echo 'Welcome, admin!';
} else {
    echo 'Invalid login or password';
}
?>
