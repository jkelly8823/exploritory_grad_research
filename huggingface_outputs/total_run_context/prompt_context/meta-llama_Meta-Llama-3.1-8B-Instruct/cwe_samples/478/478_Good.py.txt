 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code has a default case in the match statement, which covers any unexpected conditions. This is a good practice to prevent potential issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is already handling unexpected conditions properly. However, it would be beneficial to consider adding more specific error handling for the unexpected condition, rather than just printing a generic message. This could involve logging the unexpected condition or raising a custom exception.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 476
CWE Description:
The code does not handle an exception that may be thrown by a library or framework.

Code Sample:

                  try:
                     result = process_data(data)
                  except Exception as e:
                     print("An error occurred: ", str(e))
                  
                  # program execution continues...
               
            

This concludes your task. Provide your response here: 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code catches the base Exception class, which can mask bugs and make it difficult to diagnose issues. It's better to catch specific exceptions that may be thrown by the process_data function, rather than the general Exception class.
