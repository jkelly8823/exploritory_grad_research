 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code has a default case in the switch statement, which covers all cases not explicitly handled. This prevents the code from falling through to the next case and ensures that the state is properly set for all possible user inputs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is already secure against this vulnerability.  The default case is properly set to handle any unexpected user input.  However, it would be beneficial to add comments to the code to explain the purpose of the default case and the expected behavior for unexpected user input. This would improve code readability and maintainability.  Additionally, it would be a good practice to add a check to ensure that the user input is within the expected range before passing it to the switch statement. This would prevent any potential errors that may occur if the user input is not within the expected range.  This check could be added at the beginning of the function or method that contains the switch statement.  This would provide an additional layer of security and help prevent potential errors.  However, this is not necessary to address the CWE-478 vulnerability.  The code is already secure against this vulnerability.  The default case is properly set to handle any unexpected
