 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code does not have a default case in the switch statement, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the result variable does not match any of the specified cases. This is a classic example of a CWE-478 vulnerability. The break statement after the exit() function call is unnecessary and can be removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a default case to the switch statement to handle any unexpected values of the result variable. For example: case DEFAULT: printf("Unknown result value.\n"); break; where DEFAULT is a new constant defined as #define DEFAULT 2. This will ensure that the program behaves predictably even if the result variable does not match any of the specified cases. Alternatively, consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as throwing an exception or returning an error code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The code uses a function that is not thread-safe, which can lead to data corruption or other concurrency issues.

Code Sample:

                  #include <stdio.h>
                  #include <stdlib.h>
                  #include <string.h>
                  #include <pthread.h>
