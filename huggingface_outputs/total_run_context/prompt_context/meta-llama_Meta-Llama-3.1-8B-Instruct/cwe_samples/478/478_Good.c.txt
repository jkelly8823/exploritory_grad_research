 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code has a default case in the switch statement, which covers all possible values of the result variable. This makes it unlikely for the program to reach the "Unknown error" message. However, it's worth noting that the use of exit() in the default case can make it difficult to debug the program if the default case is reached. A better approach would be to handle the unknown error in a more controlled manner, such as by logging the error and continuing execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as logging the error and continuing execution.
2. Remove the use of exit() in the default case, as it can make it difficult to debug the program if the default case is reached.
