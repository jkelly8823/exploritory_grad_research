 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code does not have a default case in the switch statement. This means that if the input points is not 0, 1, or 2, the code will not return the correct interest rate. This is a potential security vulnerability because it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a default case to the switch statement to handle any unexpected input. For example: case default: result = new BigDecimal("4.25"); break; This will ensure that the code returns a default interest rate if the input points is not 0, 1, or 2. Alternatively, you could also consider throwing an exception or logging an error to handle unexpected input. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 476
CWE Description:
The code does not handle the case where the input points is negative.

Code Sample:

                  public BigDecimal getInterestRate(int points) {
                        if (points < 0) {
                            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Points cannot be negative");
                        }
                        BigDecimal result = new BigDecimal(INTEREST_RATE_AT_ZERO_POINTS);
                        switch (points) {
                            case 0:
                                result =
