 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code does not have a default case in the switch statement. However, the default case is not necessary in this scenario because the switch statement only handles three cases (0, 1, and 2). The code will still work as expected without the default case. Nevertheless, it is a good practice to include a default case to handle unexpected values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a default case to the switch statement to handle unexpected values. The default case can be used to log the unexpected value and return a default interest rate or throw an exception. For example:
```java
default:
    System.err.println("Invalid value for points, must be 0, 1 or 2");
    return BigDecimal.ZERO;
``` 
or
```java
default:
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid value for points, must be 0, 1 or 2");
``` 
Note that the default case should be placed at the end of the switch statement, after all the other cases.
