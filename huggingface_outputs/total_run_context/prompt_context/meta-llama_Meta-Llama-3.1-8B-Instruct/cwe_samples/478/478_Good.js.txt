 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code has a default case in the switch statement, which covers all cases not explicitly handled. This prevents the code from falling through to the next case or continuing execution without handling the unexpected step.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure in this regard.  The default case is properly implemented and will handle any unexpected step encountered.  However, it would be beneficial to consider adding additional logging or error handling to provide more information about the unexpected step.  This could be done by adding a console.log statement or a logging library to the default case.  This would provide more insight into the unexpected step and aid in debugging.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider adding a try-catch block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the switch statement.  This would provide a more robust error handling mechanism and prevent the program from crashing in the event of an error.  However, this is not directly related to the CWE-478 vulnerability.  The code is secure in this regard.  The default case is properly implemented and will handle any unexpected step encountered.  However, it would be beneficial to consider adding additional logging or error handling
