 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-285 because it does not perform any authorization check when accessing the database. The function runEmployeeQuery() allows any user to access the database by simply passing the database name and the name of the employee. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Although the code uses a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89, it does not address the authorization issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authorization checks before accessing the database. This can be done by verifying the user's credentials or role before allowing them to access the database.
2. Use a more secure method to pass the database name, such as using a configuration file or environment variables.
3. Consider using a more secure database connection method, such as using a connection pool or a more modern database library.
