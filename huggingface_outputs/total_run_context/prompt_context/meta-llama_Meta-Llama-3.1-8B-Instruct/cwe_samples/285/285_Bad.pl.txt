 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-285 because it does not perform an authorization check when displaying a private message. The function DisplayPrivateMessage is called with the id parameter which is retrieved from the CGI query string. However, the code does not verify if the user is authorized to view the message with the given id. This could potentially allow an attacker to view private messages that they are not authorized to see.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add an authorization check before calling the DisplayPrivateMessage function. This could involve verifying the user's permissions or checking if the message is intended for the current user.
2. Consider using a more secure method to retrieve the message id, such as using a session variable or a secure token. 
3. Ensure that the AuthenticateUser function is properly implemented to prevent unauthorized access. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to display the message, such as using a template engine that can handle user input securely.
