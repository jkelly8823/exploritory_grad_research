 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.getcwd()` function returns the current working directory, which can be manipulated by an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory. The `os.path.normpath()` function is used to normalize the path, but it does not prevent path traversal attacks. An attacker can provide a filename that starts with `../` or `./` to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the filename and ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use the `os.path.join()` function to construct the path, which will prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Use a try-except block to handle potential exceptions and provide a more informative error message. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly validate the external input to prevent directory traversal.

Code Sample:

                  
                     import os
                     import sys
                     def main():
                        
                        filename = sys
