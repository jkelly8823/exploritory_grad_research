 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The filename is obtained from an external source (System.getProperty) and is used to construct a pathname to a file. However, the filename is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the filename to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of CWE-22.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the filename before using it to construct the pathname. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides filename validation.
2. Consider using a more secure method to obtain the filename, such as using a configuration file or a database that is not accessible to the attacker.
3. Use a File object with a specific directory path instead of relying on the filename to determine the directory. For example: File dictionaryFile = new File("/path/to/dictionary"); 
4. Consider using a library that provides secure file handling, such as Apache Commons IO.
