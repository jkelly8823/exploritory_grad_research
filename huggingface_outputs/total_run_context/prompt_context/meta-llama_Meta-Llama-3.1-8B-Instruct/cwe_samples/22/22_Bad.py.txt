 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join()` function is used to construct a path by joining the current working directory with the filename provided as an argument. However, this can lead to a path traversal attack if the filename contains a directory traversal sequence, such as '../'. The `os.path.join()` function does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `os.path.abspath()` function to ensure that the path is absolute and cannot be manipulated by an attacker.
2. Use the `os.path.dirname()` function to ensure that the path is within the intended directory.
3. Validate the filename to ensure it does not contain any directory traversal sequences.
4. Consider using a library like `pathlib` which provides a more secure way to handle paths. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
