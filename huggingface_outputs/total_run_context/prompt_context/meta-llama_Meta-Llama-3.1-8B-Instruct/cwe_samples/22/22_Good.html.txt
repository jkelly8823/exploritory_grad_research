 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it allows the user to upload a file with a path that can be manipulated to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of CWE-22, where the application uses external input to construct a pathname that can be used to access files outside of the restricted directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the file path to ensure it only contains the intended directory and file name.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific file extensions to be uploaded.
3. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to handle file uploads, such as Apache Commons FileUpload. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a SQL command and sends the command to a SQL parser without performing adequate validation.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
                  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
                  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
