 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The GetUntrustedInput() function is used to get user input, which is then used to construct a pathname. The regular expression s/\.\.\/// is used to remove any ".." from the input, but this does not prevent the user from entering a path that is outside of the restricted directory. For example, if the user enters "/home/user/../etc/passwd", the regular expression will remove the ".." but the resulting path will still be outside of the restricted directory. This can be exploited by an attacker to read sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input. Only allow specific directories and files to be accessed.
2. Use a library that can safely handle user input, such as Path::Class.
3. Use a secure method to construct the pathname, such as using File::Spec to join the directory and filename. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
