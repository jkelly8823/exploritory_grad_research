VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The variable "filename" is constructed by extracting the filename from the HTTP header, which can be controlled by an attacker. The filename is then appended to the "uploadLocation" variable, which is a constant value representing the upload directory. However, the filename is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the filename to traverse outside of the intended upload directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize and validate the "filename" variable to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides path validation.
2. Use a more secure method to construct the file path, such as using a Path object from the java.nio.file package, which provides a more secure way to handle file paths.
3. Consider using a more secure upload mechanism, such as using a library that provides secure file uploads, such as Apache Commons FileUpload.
