 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The getInputPath() function is not validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside of the /safe_dir/ directory. This is because the path is not properly sanitized, allowing special elements such as ".." to be used to traverse the directory structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input path to ensure it only contains the expected characters and does not contain any special elements that could be used for path traversal.
2. Use a library such as Apache Commons IO to safely manipulate file paths and avoid the use of File.delete() which can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure approach such as using a File object with a restricted directory and then using the File.listFiles() method to list the files in that directory. This approach would prevent an attacker from accessing files outside of the restricted directory.
