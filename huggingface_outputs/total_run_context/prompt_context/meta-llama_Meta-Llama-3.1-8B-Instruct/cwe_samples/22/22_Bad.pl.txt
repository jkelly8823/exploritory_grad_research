 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The variable $username is taken directly from the user input and is used to construct the path to the profile. This allows an attacker to potentially access files outside of the intended directory by manipulating the $username variable to include directory traversal characters such as '../'.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a whitelist approach to validate the $username variable to ensure it only contains valid characters. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to match the input against a set of allowed characters. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to construct the path, such as using a path manipulation library that can handle directory traversal attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a format string that is used in a printf or sprintf function, but the product does not properly validate the format string to prevent attacks that use the format string as a command.

Code Sample:

                  my $formatString = param("format");my $data = sprintf($formatString, "Hello, World!");print $data;
