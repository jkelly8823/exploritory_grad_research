 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-617 because it uses an assert statement to check if the email parameter is not null. However, an attacker could potentially manipulate the request to make the email parameter null, triggering the assert statement and causing the application to exit. This is a severe vulnerability because it can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the assert statement with a more robust null check, such as using the Optional class in Java.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to handle the case where the email parameter is null, rather than relying on the assert statement.
3. Validate the email parameter to ensure it meets the expected format and length. This can help prevent an attacker from manipulating the request to trigger the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:

Code Sample:
