 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-794 because it directly uses the untrusted input from the user to construct a file path. The regular expression used to remove the special characters does not cover all possible special characters, and the code does not properly sanitize the input. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious characters into the file path, leading to a potential path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a library like Path::Class to properly sanitize the file path and prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle file paths, such as using a hash or a UUID to generate a unique file path. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not validate or sanitize the data before using it.

Code Sample:

                  my $data = GetUntrustedInput();my $result = process_data($data);print $result;
