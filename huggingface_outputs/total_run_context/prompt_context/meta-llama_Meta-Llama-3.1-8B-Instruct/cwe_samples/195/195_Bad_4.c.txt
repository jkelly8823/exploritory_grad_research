 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-195 because it performs a subtraction operation on the return value of the returnChunkSize function, which is an unsigned integer, and then passes the result to the memcpy function. This can lead to an unexpected value being passed to memcpy, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the return type of the returnChunkSize function to a signed integer to prevent the unsigned integer overflow.
2. Use a safe function like memcpy_s to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Validate the return value of returnChunkSize before passing it to memcpy to ensure it is a valid size. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is declared but not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
                        int x;
                        int y = 5;
                        int z = x + y;
                        return 0;
                    }
