 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-195 because it casts the signed integer numHeaders to an unsigned integer when it is used to allocate memory for the headers array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if numHeaders is negative, as the cast will produce an unexpectedly large value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the type of numHeaders to unsigned int to prevent the cast.
2. Use a safer method to allocate memory, such as using a buffer size that is a power of 2 to avoid potential issues with alignment.
3. Consider using a more robust method to handle the case where numHeaders is greater than 100, such as using a loop to process the headers individually. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable-length string without bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is longer than expected.

Code Sample:

                  char buffer[10];char *str = "Hello, World!";strncpy(buffer, str, 10);printf("%s", buffer);
