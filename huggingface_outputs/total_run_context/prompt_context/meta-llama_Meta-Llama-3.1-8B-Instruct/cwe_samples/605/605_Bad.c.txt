 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-605 because it allows multiple sockets to bind to the same port. In this case, the port number 21 is used, which is typically associated with the FTP service. This could potentially allow other services on the same port to be stolen or spoofed. The issue arises from the fact that the bind() function is called with the address of a variable's1' which is not defined in the given code snippet. This could potentially be a pointer to a different socket address structure, allowing multiple sockets to bind to the same port.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the bind() function is called with the address of the correct socket address structure, i.e.,'server_address'.
2. Consider using a different port number to avoid potential conflicts with other services.
3. Implement a mechanism to prevent multiple sockets from binding to the same port, such as using a unique port number for each socket or using a socket address structure with a unique identifier.
