 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided defines a register with a default value of 1225, which is a secure value. This suggests that the code is correctly defining register defaults to secure values, and therefore, it is not vulnerable to CWE-1221.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and verify the default values of registers to ensure they are set to secure values. Additionally, consider using secure coding practices and guidelines when working with hardware description languages.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 1221 CWE Description: Hardware description language code incorrectly defines register defaults or hardware Intellectual Property (IP) parameters to insecure values.  Code Sample: register_example #(.REGISTER_WIDTH (32),.REGISTER_DEFAULT (1225) // Correct default value set, to enable Secure_mode ) Secure_Device_ID_example (.Data_in (Data_in),.Data_out (Secure_reg),.Clk (Clk),.resetn (resetn),.write (write) );                    ``` VULNERABLE: NO VULNERABLE_LINES: None EXPLANATION: The code sample
