 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a parameter MEM_SIZE to be 100, which is a fixed value. However, this value is not validated or checked for any potential security risks. In a real-world scenario, this value could be set to a large or malicious value, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other security issues. Additionally, the localparam JTAG_OFFSET is set to 100, which could also be a potential security risk if not properly validated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the MEM_SIZE parameter to ensure it is within a safe range.
2. Consider using a more secure method to define the JTAG_OFFSET, such as using a secure random number generator.
3. Consider using a secure method to define the MEM_SIZE, such as using a secure random number generator or a secure hash function.

CWE_ID: 1221
CWE Description:
Hardware description language code incorrectly defines register defaults or hardware Intellectual Property (IP) parameters to insecure values.  CWE-1221 is a specific type of CWE-122, which is a more general category of vulnerabilities related to hardware description language (HDL) code. CWE-
