 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1221 because it sets the default value of the `acct_mem` array to all ones (`32'hffffffff`). This could potentially lead to a security issue if the array is used to store sensitive information. The use of `32'hffffffff` as a default value is insecure because it does not follow the recommended practice of setting default values to a secure state, such as all zeros.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the default value of `acct_mem` to a secure state, such as all zeros (`32'h00000000`).
2. Consider using a secure initialization mechanism, such as a reset value, to ensure that the array is initialized to a secure state.
