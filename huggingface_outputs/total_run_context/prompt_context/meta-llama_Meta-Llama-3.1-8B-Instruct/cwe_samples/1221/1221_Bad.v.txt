 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to CWE-1221 due to the incorrect definition of register defaults or hardware Intellectual Property (IP) parameters to insecure values. In the module register_example, the default value of the register is computed from the width, which sets all bits to 1s except bit 0 (Secure_mode). However, in the module register_top, the default value of the register is set to 1224, which is an incorrect value. Additionally, in the second instance of the register_example module, the default value is not defined, which will result in the default value being 2^32-2, which is also an insecure value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Define the default value of the register explicitly in the module register_top, instead of relying on the computed default value.
2. Ensure that the default value of the register is secure and does not pose any security risks.
3. Consider using a secure default value, such as 0, for the register. 
4. Review the code and ensure that all instances of the register_example module are using secure default values. 
5. Consider using a secure coding standard or
