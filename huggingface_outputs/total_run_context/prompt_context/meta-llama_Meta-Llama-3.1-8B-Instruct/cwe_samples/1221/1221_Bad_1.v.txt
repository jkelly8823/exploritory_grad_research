 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a local parameter JTAG_OFFSET to 81, which is used to access the memory array mem. However, the memory array mem is defined with a size of MEM_SIZE, which is 100. This means that the memory array mem is being accessed out of bounds when JTAG_OFFSET is 81, as it is greater than the size of the array. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the JTAG_OFFSET is within the bounds of the memory array mem. This can be done by checking if JTAG_OFFSET is less than or equal to MEM_SIZE-1.
2. Consider using a safer way to access the memory array, such as using a pointer or an index variable that is checked for bounds before accessing the array.
3. Consider using a secure way to define the memory array, such as using a secure memory allocation function or a secure data type.
