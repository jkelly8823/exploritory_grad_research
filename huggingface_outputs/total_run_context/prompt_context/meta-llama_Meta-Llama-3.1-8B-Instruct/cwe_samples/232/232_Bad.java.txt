 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-232 because it does not handle the case when the 'address' parameter is not defined or supported. If the 'address' parameter is missing or empty, the code will throw a NullPointerException when trying to trim it. Additionally, the code is using a parameterized query, but it is not properly handling the case when the 'address' parameter is not defined or supported. The '?' in the SQL query is a placeholder for the address parameter, but if the address parameter is not defined, it will be treated as a literal '?' in the SQL query, which can lead to a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the 'address' parameter is defined and supported before trying to trim it.
2. Use a try-catch block to catch and handle the NullPointerException that may be thrown when trying to trim the 'address' parameter.
3. Use a more robust way to handle the case when the 'address' parameter is not defined or supported, such as using a default value or throwing a custom exception.
4. Use a prepared statement with a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, make sure to
