 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-193 because the loop counter variable 'i' is not checked for the maximum value of PATH_SIZE. The loop will run one extra time, potentially causing an out-of-bounds access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the loop counter variable 'i' is checked against the maximum value of PATH_SIZE. This can be done by changing the loop condition to 'i < PATH_SIZE - 1'. Alternatively, use a safer approach by using a 'while' loop with a separate counter variable. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product generates error messages that may reveal sensitive information.

Code Sample:

                  if (error_code == 1) {
                        printf("Error: unable to open file %s\n", filename);
                  } else if (error_code == 2) {
                        printf("Error: unable to read file %s\n", filename);
                  } else {
                        printf("Error: unknown error\n");
                  }
