 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-193 because it uses an incorrect maximum value for the loop counter. The loop counter `i` is set to `PATH_SIZE` which is 60, but the array `filename` has a size of `PATH_SIZE` which is also 60. However, the array indices in C start from 0, so the last valid index for the array is `PATH_SIZE - 1`. The loop counter `i` is not checked for this condition, and it will attempt to access `filename[60]` which is out of bounds. This can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the loop counter to `i < PATH_SIZE` to prevent accessing out of bounds memory.
2. Consider using a safer way to read the filename, such as using `fgets` which can handle the buffer size and null-terminate the string for you. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code of the program does nothing and can be optimized away at compile time.

Code Sample:

                  int x = 0;
                  int y = 0;
