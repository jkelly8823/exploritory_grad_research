 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-193 because the sprintf function is used to format the filename. The format string "%16s.dat" is used to ensure the filename is 16 characters long, but it does not account for the ".dat" extension. This means that if the filename is longer than 16 characters, it will be truncated, resulting in an incorrect filename being saved to the database. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access the file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a more robust method to handle filename formatting, such as using a library function or a custom function that takes into account the length of the filename and the extension.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve filenames, such as using a database that supports storing and retrieving binary data.
