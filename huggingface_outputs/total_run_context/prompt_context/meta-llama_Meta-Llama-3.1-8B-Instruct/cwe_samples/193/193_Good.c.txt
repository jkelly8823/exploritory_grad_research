 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-193 because it uses an incorrect maximum value when calculating the size of the buffer for the strncat function. The correct maximum value should be the size of the buffer minus the length of the string already in the buffer, but the code subtracts 1 from this value. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the strings are longer than expected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the correct formula to calculate the maximum size for the strncat function: sizeof(fullname) - strlen(fullname). 
2. Consider using a safer function like snprintf or sprintf to avoid buffer overflows. 
3. Always check the return value of strncat to ensure it did not overflow the buffer. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to concatenate strings, such as using a library like strsafe.h.  ```c
strncat(fullname, firstname, sizeof(fullname) - strlen(fullname));
strncat(fullname, lastname, sizeof(fullname) - strlen(fullname));
``` 
5. Consider using a safer function like snprintf or sprintf to avoid buffer overflows. 
6. Always check the return
