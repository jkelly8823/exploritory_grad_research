 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-193 because it does not check for the case where numWidgets equals MAX_NUM_WIDGETS. This would result in an out-of-bounds access when trying to access WidgetList[MAX_NUM_WIDGETS].
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that numWidgets is strictly less than MAX_NUM_WIDGETS before allocating memory for WidgetList.
2. Consider using a safer allocation function that can handle the case where numWidgets equals MAX_NUM_WIDGETS, such as realloc or a custom function that handles this case. 
3. Consider adding bounds checking when accessing WidgetList to prevent out-of-bounds access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code of the application stores sensitive information in locations that are easily accessible to an attacker.

Code Sample:

                  char password[10];printf("Enter your password: ");fgets(password, sizeof(password), stdin);printf("Your password is: %s\n", password);
