 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-234 because the function foo_funct is called with only two arguments, but it expects three. This can lead to undefined behavior if the function tries to access the third argument, which is not provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function foo_funct should be called with the correct number of arguments, or the function should be modified to handle a variable number of arguments. For example, the function could be modified to use a variable number of arguments by changing its declaration to void foo_funct(int one, int two,...) {printf("1) %d\n2) %d\n", one, two); va_start(ap, two); while (va_arg(ap, int)) printf("\n%d", va_arg(ap, int)); va_end(ap);}. Alternatively, the function could be called with the correct number of arguments, such as foo_funct(one, two, three).
