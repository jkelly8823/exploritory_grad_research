 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-93 because it directly concatenates user input ("streetAddress") into a string without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious CRLF sequences, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a parameterized query or prepared statement to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Alternatively, use a library like OWASP ESAPI to encode user input before concatenating it into the string. For example: 
logger.info("User's street address: " + ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(request.getParameter("streetAddress"))); 
This will ensure that any malicious input is properly sanitized and cannot be used to inject CRLF sequences. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses external input to construct a SQL command without using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
                  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
                  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
