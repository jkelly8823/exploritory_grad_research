EXPLANATION:
The Kibitzer class does not call super.clone() in its clone() method, which is a violation of the Cloneable interface. This can lead to shallow copies of objects, where the new object references the same objects as the original object, rather than creating new objects. The FancyKibitzer class, which extends Kibitzer, does call super.clone() in its clone() method, which is correct.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Modify the Kibitzer class to call super.clone() in its clone() method.
2. Ensure that all classes that extend Kibitzer also call super.clone() in their clone() methods.

                              int y = x / z;
                              System.out.println(y);
                        }
                     }
