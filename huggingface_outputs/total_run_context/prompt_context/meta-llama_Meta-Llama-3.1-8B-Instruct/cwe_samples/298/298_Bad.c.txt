 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a certificate expiration issue because it incorrectly validates the certificate expiration. The line `if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))` suggests that the code considers a certificate that has expired as valid, which is a security risk. This is because a certificate that has expired may have been compromised or abandoned, and trusting it may lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the condition to only consider `X509_V_OK` as a valid result, and handle `X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED` as an error.
2. Consider implementing a certificate revocation list (CRL) check to ensure that the certificate has not been revoked.
3. Regularly update the certificate store to ensure that expired certificates are removed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for a null pointer before dereferencing it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.

Code Sample:

                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
                        foo=SSL_get
