VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1220 because the access control policy is too broad. The condition (j==6) allows access to the security-sensitive assets from an unauthorized agent (j=6) when the access control policy is set to priv_lvl_i. This is because the policy lacks required granularity, allowing accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more granular access control policy that restricts accesses to security-sensitive assets based on the actual privileges of the agents.
2. Review and refine the access control policy to ensure it is not too broad and allows accesses from unauthorized agents to security-sensitive assets. 
3. Consider using a more fine-grained access control mechanism, such as role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict accesses to security-sensitive assets. 
4. Ensure that the access control policy is properly configured and enforced to prevent unauthorized accesses to security-sensitive assets. 
5. Regularly review and update the access control policy to ensure it remains effective and aligned with the security requirements of the system.  ```bash
