 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1220 because the access control policy is too broad. The policy allows accesses from unauthorized agents to security-sensitive assets. The code assigns values from the `access_ctrl_i` array to the `connectivity_map_o` array without checking the access level of the agents. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive assets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more granular access control policy that checks the access level of each agent before assigning values to the `connectivity_map_o` array.
2. Use a more secure method to assign values to the `connectivity_map_o` array, such as using a secure function that checks the access level of each agent. 
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a hash table or a graph, to represent the connectivity map, which can provide better control over access to sensitive assets. 4. Regularly review and update the access control policy to ensure it remains effective and up-to-date. 5. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to further protect sensitive assets. 6. Use secure coding practices, such as input validation
