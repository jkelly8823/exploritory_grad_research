 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure because it includes a database connection file that may contain sensitive information such as database credentials. This file should not be accessible to users. Additionally, the authenticateUser function is called directly from the code, which may also contain sensitive information. It is recommended to move the database connection and authentication logic to a secure location, such as a separate file or a secure database connection pool.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the database connection and authentication logic to a secure location, such as a separate file or a secure database connection pool.
2. Ensure that the database connection file and the authenticateUser function do not contain sensitive information.
3. Consider using a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to authenticate users.
