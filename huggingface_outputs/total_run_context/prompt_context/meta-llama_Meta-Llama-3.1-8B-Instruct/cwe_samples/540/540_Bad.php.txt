 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code contains sensitive information such as database credentials ($dbName and $dbPassword) which are directly accessible to users. This is a potential security risk as an attacker could exploit this information to gain unauthorized access to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store database credentials securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure configuration file.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code.
3. Consider using a secure method to connect to the database, such as using a library that supports secure connections.

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code directly echoes user input ($var) without proper sanitization or encoding, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code to steal user data or take control of the
