 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-487 because the package'math' is not inherently closed, and the class 'Lebesgue' is implementing an interface 'Integration'. This could potentially allow malicious code to be injected into the package, compromising its security. The 'Static' keyword is also incorrectly used, it should be'static'.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Close the package by adding a 'package-private' access modifier to the 'youAreHidingThisFunction' method.
2. Correct the 'Static' keyword to'static'.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a sealed class or an enum, to ensure the package's integrity. 
4. Review the 'Integration' interface to ensure it is not exposing any sensitive information. 5. Consider using a dependency injection framework to manage the 'Integration' interface. 6. Use a code analysis tool to scan the code for any potential security vulnerabilities. 7. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure random number generator, to generate the 'youAreHidingThisFunction' method's return value. 8. Review the code's documentation to ensure
