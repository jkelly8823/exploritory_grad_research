 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-914 because it uses the extract() function to extract variables from the $_POST array. This can lead to dynamically-identified variables being read from or written to, which can be exploited by an attacker. Additionally, the mysql_real_escape_string() function is used to sanitize the input, but it is not sufficient to prevent this type of vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the extract() function, instead use the $_POST array directly.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Use a more secure method to sanitize user input, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters. 
4. Consider using a more secure database library, such as PDO. 
5. Remove the $isAdmin variable and instead use a more secure method to determine if the user is an administrator. 6. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID. 7. Use a secure random number generator to generate session IDs. 8. Consider using a secure cookie library, such as PHP Secure Cookie. 9. Use a secure method to store sensitive data, such
