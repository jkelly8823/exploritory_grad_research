 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-839 because it checks if the withdrawal amount is less than the maximum withdrawal limit, but it does not check if the withdrawal amount is greater than or equal to zero. This could potentially allow a user to withdraw a negative amount, which could lead to an inconsistent state of the bank account.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the withdrawal amount is greater than or equal to zero before performing the withdrawal.
2. Consider adding a check to ensure that the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current account balance to prevent over-withdrawal. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

                           // variable for bank account balance
                           private double accountBalance;
                           
                           // constructor for BankAccount
                           public BankAccount() {accountBalance = 0;}
                           
                           // method to deposit amount into BankAccount
