 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-839 because it checks if the withdrawAmount is less than the MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT and greater than the MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT. However, it does not check if the withdrawAmount is greater than or equal to the MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT before checking if it is less than the MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT. This could potentially allow a user to withdraw an amount less than the minimum withdrawal limit.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if the withdrawAmount is greater than or equal to the MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT before checking if it is less than the MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT. This can be achieved by changing the if statement to: if (withdrawAmount >= MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT && withdrawAmount <= MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT). This will ensure that the withdrawAmount is within the valid range before allowing the withdrawal.
