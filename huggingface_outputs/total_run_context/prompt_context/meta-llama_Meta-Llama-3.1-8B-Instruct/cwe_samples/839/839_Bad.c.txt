 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-839 because it checks if the number of headers is greater than 100, but it does not check if it is less than or equal to 0. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access when allocating memory for the headers array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that numHeaders is within the valid range (0 <= numHeaders <= 100) before allocating memory for the headers array.
2. Consider using a safer memory allocation function, such as malloc() with a size check, to prevent potential buffer overflows. 
3. Use a more robust data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array or a linked list, to store the packet headers, which can help prevent out-of-bounds access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 122
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is declared but not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int x;int y = 5;int z = x + y;printf("%d", z);
