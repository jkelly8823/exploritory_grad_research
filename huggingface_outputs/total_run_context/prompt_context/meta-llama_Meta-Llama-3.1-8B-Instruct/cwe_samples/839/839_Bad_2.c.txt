 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check if the index is less than the minimum allowed index. It only checks if the index is less than the length of the array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access if the index is less than 0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the index is greater than or equal to 0 before accessing the array.
2. Consider using a more robust way to handle out-of-bounds access, such as using a bounds-checked array access function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for a null pointer before dereferencing it.

Code Sample:

                  int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
                        
                           int value;
                           
                           // check that the array index is less than the maximum
                           
                           
                           // length of the array
                           if (index < len) {
                              
                                 
                                 // get the value at the specified index of the array
                                 value = array[index];
                           }
                           // if array index is invalid then output error message
                           
                           
                           // and return value indicating
