 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-807 because it relies on the existence of a cookie to determine if the user is authenticated. However, an attacker can modify the cookie value to bypass the authentication check. Additionally, the code does not properly validate the user input, which can lead to further vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to authenticate users, such as a session-based system or a token-based system.
2. Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. Use a secure cookie mechanism, such as HTTPS, to prevent cookie tampering. 
4. Implement a proper authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access. 
5. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
6. Use a secure method to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as passwords. 
7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 
8. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks. 
9. Implement a secure way to handle errors and exceptions to prevent sensitive information from being leaked. 
10. Use a secure method to handle user
