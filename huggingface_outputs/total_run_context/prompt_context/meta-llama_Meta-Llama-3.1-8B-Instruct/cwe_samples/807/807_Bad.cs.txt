 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-807 because it relies on the existence of a specific hostname ("trustme.com") to determine if a host is trusted. However, an attacker could potentially modify the hostname of the host to bypass this protection mechanism. This could be done by spoofing the DNS response or by modifying the host's DNS settings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to determine if a host is trusted, such as checking the host's IP address against a trusted list or using a secure authentication mechanism.
2. Consider using a secure DNS resolution method, such as using a DNSSEC-enabled resolver, to prevent DNS spoofing attacks.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as IP blocking or rate limiting, to prevent brute-force attacks on the system. 4. Regularly review and update the trusted hostname list to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date. 5. Consider using a more secure method to parse the hostname, such as using a library that can handle DNS spoofing attacks. 6. Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security incidents. 7. Consider using a secure communication protocol, such as TLS
