 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-807 because it relies on the existence and value of a cookie named "role" to determine the user's role. However, an attacker could potentially modify the cookie's value or name to bypass this protection mechanism. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the cookie's name and value before using it to determine the user's role.
2. Consider using a more secure method to authenticate users, such as a session-based approach or a token-based approach.
3. Implement a secure cookie handling mechanism to prevent tampering with the cookie's value or name. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
