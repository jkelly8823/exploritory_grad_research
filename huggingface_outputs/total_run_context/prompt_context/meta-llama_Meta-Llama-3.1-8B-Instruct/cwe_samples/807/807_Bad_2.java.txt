 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-807 because it relies on the existence of a specific domain name ("trustme.com") to determine if a request is trusted. However, an attacker could potentially modify the request's IP address to bypass this protection mechanism. This is a classic example of a "domain name spoofing" attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to determine if a request is trusted, such as checking the request's headers or cookies.
2. Consider using a whitelist of trusted IP addresses or domains instead of relying on a single domain name.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as rate limiting or IP blocking, to prevent brute-force attacks.
