VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for the presence of '..' in the directory name before creating the directory. However, it does not check for other invalid characters that could be introduced after filtering. Although the code does filter out the '~' character, it does not validate the filtered string for any other invalid characters. This could potentially allow an attacker to create a directory with an invalid name.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the filtered directory name for any other invalid characters before creating the directory.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate directory names, where only a specific set of allowed characters are accepted. 
3. Use a more robust validation function that checks for a wider range of invalid characters, such as those that could be used to create a directory traversal attack. 
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure way to create directories and handle user input.
