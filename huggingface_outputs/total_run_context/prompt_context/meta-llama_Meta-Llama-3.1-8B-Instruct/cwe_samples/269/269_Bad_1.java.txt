 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-269 because it does not properly check the privileges of the requesting user. The `isAuthenticated` method is called before checking the user's role, which means that an authenticated user with a role of GUEST can still access the debug information. This is because the `isAuthenticated` method does not check the user's role, it only checks if the user is logged in. To fix this, the code should check the user's role before printing the debug information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the role check before the `isAuthenticated` method call.
2. Use a more secure approach to handle user roles, such as using a role-based access control system. 
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle authentication, such as using a token-based system.

                     }
