 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-269 because it does not properly check the privileges of the requesting user. The `isAuthenticated` method is called, but it does not check the role of the user. The `switch` statement checks the role of the user, but it only allows the ADMIN role to perform the action. The GUEST and USER roles are not allowed to perform the action, but the code does not check if the user is authenticated before checking their role. This creates an unintended sphere of control for the GUEST and USER roles.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the `isAuthenticated` check to before the `switch` statement to ensure that only authenticated users can perform the action.
2. Remove the `case GUEST` and `case USER` statements from the `switch` statement, as they are not allowed to perform the action.
3. Add a check to ensure that the user is not null before calling the `setPassword` method.
