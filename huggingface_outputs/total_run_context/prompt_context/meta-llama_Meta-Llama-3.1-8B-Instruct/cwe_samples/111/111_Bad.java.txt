 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-111 because it uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to call code written in another programming language, which can expose the application to weaknesses in that code. In this case, the code is loading a native library called "echo" using System.loadLibrary(). This can potentially introduce vulnerabilities from the native code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the native code in the "echo" library to ensure it does not contain any vulnerabilities.
2. Consider using a sandboxed environment to run the native code, to isolate it from the rest of the application.
3. Use a secure coding practice, such as code review and testing, to ensure that the native code is secure. 
4. Consider using a library that provides a secure interface to the native code, to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. 5. If possible, avoid using native code and instead use Java code to implement the functionality. 6. Use a secure library loading mechanism, such as using a trusted library loader, to load the native library. 7. Consider using a code obfuscation tool to make it harder for attackers to understand the native code. 8
