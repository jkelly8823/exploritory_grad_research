 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-111 due to the use of the gets() function, which is a known insecure function that can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious input. The gets() function does not perform any bounds checking on the input, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the gets() function with a safer function such as fgets(), which performs bounds checking on the input. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for reading input, such as using a library that provides secure input handling. For example, you can use the getline() function from the POSIX standard, which is designed to be more secure than gets(). Here is an example of how you can modify the code to use fgets():```c
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Echo_runEcho(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj){
    char buf[64];
    fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin);
    printf(buf);
}
