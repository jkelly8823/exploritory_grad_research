 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The variable $fname is not properly sanitized before being used in the system call. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the value of $fname. For example, if an attacker passes a value like "/bin/ls -l; rm -rf /", the system call would execute the ls command and then delete the entire file system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensure that only allowed characters are passed to the system call. You can use a regular expression to match the allowed characters. Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to system calls, such as using a library that provides a secure way to execute commands. For example, you can use the "File::Spec" module to construct the command string in a safe way. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89

intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.
