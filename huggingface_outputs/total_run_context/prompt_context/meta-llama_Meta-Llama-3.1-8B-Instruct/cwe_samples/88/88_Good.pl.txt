 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection due to the use of regular expression to validate the input. The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` does not properly delimit the intended arguments, options, or switches within the command string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a whitelist approach to validate the input, and ensure that only expected characters are allowed. For example, you can use a regular expression like `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$` to only allow alphanumeric characters. Additionally, consider using a parameterized query or a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
