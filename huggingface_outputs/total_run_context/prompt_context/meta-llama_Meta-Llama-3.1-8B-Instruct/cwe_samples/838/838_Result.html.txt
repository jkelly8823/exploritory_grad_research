 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of the 'onload' event handler in the 'img' tag. The 'onload' event handler is executed when the image is loaded, and it can be used to execute malicious JavaScript code. In this case, the code attempts to access the 'document.cookie' property, which can be used to steal sensitive information such as session IDs or authentication tokens.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within a web page. This can help prevent XSS attacks by specifying which scripts are allowed to run.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious code from being injected into the page.
3. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block suspicious traffic. 
4. Consider using a library like DOMPurify to sanitize user input and prevent XSS attacks. 
5. Avoid using inline event handlers like 'onload' and instead use JavaScript event listeners to handle events. This can help prevent XSS attacks by making it more difficult for attackers to inject
