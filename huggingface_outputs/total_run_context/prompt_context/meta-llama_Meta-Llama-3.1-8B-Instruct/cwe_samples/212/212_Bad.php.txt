 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure because it stores the user's email address in the $record array. When the 'json' flag is not set, the code iterates over the $record array and writes the field values to an HTML page. However, it skips displaying the email address. This means that the email address is still stored in the $record array and can be accessed by unauthorized actors. When the 'json' flag is set, the code directly echoes the $record array as JSON, which includes the email address. This allows unauthorized actors to access the email address.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the email address from the $record array before writing it to the HTML page or echoing it as JSON.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve user data, such as using a database with proper access controls.
3. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
