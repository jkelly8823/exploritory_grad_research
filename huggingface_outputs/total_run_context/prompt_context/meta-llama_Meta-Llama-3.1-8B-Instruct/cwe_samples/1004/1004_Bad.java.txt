 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to cookie hijacking because the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag. This allows a malicious script to access the cookie, potentially leading to session fixation or other attacks. The HttpOnly flag prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, making it more secure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add the HttpOnly flag to the cookie by setting the `httpOnly` property to `true` when creating the cookie.
2. Consider using a secure protocol (HTTPS) to encrypt the cookie and prevent eavesdropping attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to weak session ID generation because it uses the `UUID.randomUUID()` method, which is not suitable for generating session IDs. This method can produce predictable and guessable IDs,
