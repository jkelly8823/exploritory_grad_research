VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided sets the HttpOnly flag for the cookie, which is a good practice to prevent JavaScript access to the cookie. However, the cookie is not marked as secure, which means it can be transmitted over an unencrypted connection. This could potentially allow an attacker to intercept the cookie and gain unauthorized access to the user's session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Mark the cookie as secure by adding the secure attribute to the Cookie object. This will ensure that the cookie is only transmitted over a secure connection (HTTPS). For example: c.setSecure(true);. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator to generate the session ID to prevent predictable session IDs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 2005
CWE Description:
The product uses a random number generator to generate a session ID, but the random number generator is not seeded with a cryptographically secure source of randomness.

Code Sample:

                  String sessionID = UUID.randomUUID().toString();response.addCookie(new Cookie("session_id", sessionID));
