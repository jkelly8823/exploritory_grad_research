 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-184 because the regular expression used to remove script tags is incomplete. The regular expression "script" only matches the word "script" literally, but it does not account for script tags that may be nested or have attributes. This means that the code may not remove all script tags from the input, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be updated to match all possible script tags, including nested and attribute-containing tags. This can be achieved by using a more robust regular expression, such as one that matches the HTML syntax for script tags. For example: return input.replaceAll("<script[^>]*>", mask); This will remove all script tags, regardless of their nesting or attributes. Additionally, it's a good practice to use a library like Jsoup to parse and manipulate HTML, which can provide more robust and secure methods for removing script tags.
