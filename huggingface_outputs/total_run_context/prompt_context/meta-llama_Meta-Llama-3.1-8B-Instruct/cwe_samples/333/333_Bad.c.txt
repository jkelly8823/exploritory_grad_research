 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-333 because it uses a true random number generator (TRNG) to generate a session ID. The TRNG is called within a loop that continuously checks for new connections. If the TRNG fails or blocks due to a lack of entropy, the program will hang indefinitely. This is because the TRNG is called within a conditional statement that is part of a loop, and if the TRNG fails, the loop will not terminate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) instead of a TRNG to generate session IDs.
2. Implement a timeout or retry mechanism to handle cases where the TRNG fails or blocks.
3. Consider using a more robust entropy source, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a dedicated TRNG with a larger entropy pool.
