 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap overflow condition. The buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory. The buffer size is determined by the variable MAX_SIZE, which is multiplied by 4 to allocate space for the buffer. However, the buffer is not checked for overflow before writing to it. If the user-supplied string is longer than MAX_SIZE, it can cause a heap overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the user-supplied string before allocating the buffer to prevent a potential overflow.
2. Use a safer function like strncpy to copy the user-supplied string to the buffer, which will prevent a buffer overflow.
3. Consider using a more secure function like asprintf to allocate the buffer and copy the string, which will prevent a buffer overflow and also handle the case where the string is longer than the buffer.

CWE_ID: 122
CWE Description: A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().
