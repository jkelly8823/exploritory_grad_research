 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-597 because it uses the "===" operator to compare a string and an integer. The "===" operator checks for both value and type equality, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing strings and integers. In this case, the code is comparing the string "65" with the integer 65, and the "===" operator will return TRUE because the values are equal, but the types are different. This can lead to bugs that are difficult to track down.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the ".equals()" method to compare strings and integers, like this: if ($s1.equals($i)) {... }. This will ensure that the comparison is done correctly and will not return TRUE for strings and integers with the same value but different types. Alternatively, you can use the "==" operator to compare the values of the string and integer, like this: if ($s1 == $i) {... }. However, this will not check for type equality, so it may not be the best solution in all cases.
