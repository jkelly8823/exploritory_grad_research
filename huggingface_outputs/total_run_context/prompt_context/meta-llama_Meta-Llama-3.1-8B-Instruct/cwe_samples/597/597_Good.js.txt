VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-597 vulnerability because it uses the "==" operator to compare a string with an integer and another string. The "==" operator checks for reference equality, not value equality, which can lead to unexpected results. In this case, the variable "s1" is a string literal, and the variable "i" is an integer. When comparing "i" with "s1", the code is checking if the reference of "i" is equal to the reference of "s1", which is not the intended behavior. The correct operator to use in this case is the ".equals()" method, which checks for value equality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the "==" operator with the ".equals()" method in the if statements.
2. Consider using the "===" operator for strict equality checks, but be aware that it will not work correctly in this case because "i" is an integer and "s1" is a string.
```javascript
if (i.equals(s1)) {
    document.getElementById("ieq2s1").innerHTML = "(i == s1) is TRUE";
}
if (s
