 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-597 vulnerability because it uses the "===" operator to compare a string with a number. In JavaScript, the "===" operator performs a strict equality check, which means it checks both the value and the type of the operands. Since the variable "i" is a number and the variables "s1" and "s4" are strings, the comparison will always return false, even if the values are equal. To fix this, the code should use the ".equals()" method or the "==" operator, which performs a loose equality check and returns true if the values are equal, regardless of the type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the "===" operator with the "==" operator in the if statements.
2. Consider using the ".equals()" method instead of the "==" operator for string comparisons. This is because the "==" operator can return false for strings that are equal when compared using the ".equals()" method. For example, the strings "abc" and "abc" would return false when compared using the "==" operator, but true when compared using the ".equals()" method.
