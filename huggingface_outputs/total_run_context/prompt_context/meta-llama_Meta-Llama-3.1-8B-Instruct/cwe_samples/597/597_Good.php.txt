 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-597 because it uses the "==" operator to compare a string and an integer. This can lead to unexpected results because the "==" operator performs a loose comparison, which can result in a true result even if the values are not equal. In this case, the string "65" is not equal to the integer 65, but the "==" operator returns true because the string "65" can be converted to the integer 65. This is not the expected behavior and can lead to bugs in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the equals() method to compare strings, like this: if ($i == $s1) should be if ($i.equals($s1)). This will ensure that the comparison is done correctly and will not return true for unexpected values. Alternatively, you can use the === operator to compare the values and their types, like this: if ($i === $s1). This will also ensure that the comparison is done correctly and will not return true for unexpected values.
