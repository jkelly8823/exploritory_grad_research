 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-597, which is a result of using the "==" operator to compare two string objects. This operator checks for reference equality, not content equality. In this case, str1 and str2 are two separate objects in memory, even though they contain the same string. Therefore, the condition "str1 == str2" will evaluate to false. To fix this, the code should use the ".equals()" method to compare the contents of the strings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the "==" operator with the ".equals()" method in the if condition. For example: if (str1.equals(str2)) {System.out.println("str1 == str2");}
2. Consider using the "String.intern()" method to ensure that the strings are interned, which can improve performance by reducing the number of objects in memory. However, this is not necessary in this case, as the strings are already identical.
