 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-14
EXPLANATION:
The equals method in the Truck class does not consider the year attribute when comparing two Truck objects. This is a vulnerability because it may lead to incorrect results when comparing two objects that have the same make and model but different years. This is an example of CWE-1023, where the comparison does not include one or more factors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the equals method should be modified to include the year attribute in the comparison. This can be done by adding the condition `this.year == t.getYear()` to the return statement. The corrected equals method should look like this:

```java
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == null) return false;
    if (o == this) return true;
    if (!(o instanceof Truck)) return false;
    Truck t = (Truck) o;
    return (this.make.equals(t.getMake()) && this.model.equals(t.getModel()) && this.year == t.getYear());
}
