 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1023 because it performs a comparison between the username and password entered by the user and the hardcoded values, but it does not consider the length of the input strings. The strncmp function is used with the length of the input strings, but the comparison is still not accurate because it does not account for the possibility of null characters in the input strings. This can lead to incorrect authentication results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to compare the username and password, such as using a secure hash function or a password verification library.
2. Always check the length of the input strings before performing any operations on them.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and compare passwords, such as using a password hashing library.
