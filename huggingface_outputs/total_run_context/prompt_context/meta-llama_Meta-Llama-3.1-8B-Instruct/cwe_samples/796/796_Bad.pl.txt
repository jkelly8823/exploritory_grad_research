 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-796 because it does not properly sanitize the input from the user. The regular expression used to remove leading dots does not account for all possible special characters that may be present in the input. Additionally, the code directly concatenates the user input with a hardcoded path, which can lead to path traversal attacks. The ReadAndSendFile function is not shown, but it is likely that it will read and send the file without proper validation, allowing an attacker to access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a proper input validation library to sanitize the user input.
2. Use a path validation library to ensure that the resulting path is within the expected directory.
3. Avoid directly concatenating user input with hardcoded paths. Instead, use a path joining function to ensure that the resulting path is correct.
4. Ensure that the ReadAndSendFile function properly validates the file path and contents before reading and sending the file.
