 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the getlogin() function in a multithreaded context, which can cause it to return incorrect values. This is because the getlogin() function is not thread-safe. The getpwnam() function is then called with the result of getlogin(), which can lead to incorrect results. This is a potential security vulnerability as it can allow unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a thread-safe method to obtain the current user's login name, such as using the pthread_getname_np() function.
2. Consider using a more secure method to determine if a group is trusted, such as using a whitelist of trusted groups.
3. Use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur when calling getpwnam(), to prevent the program from crashing in case of an error. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code uses a hardcoded password in a configuration file, which can be easily accessed by an attacker.

Code Sample:

                  char password[] = "mysecretpassword";FILE *fp = fopen("config.txt", "r");f
