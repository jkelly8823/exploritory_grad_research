 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is transmitting sensitive data in cleartext over a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. This is a clear indication of CWE-319. The code is using the HttpURLConnection to send a PUT request to a URL that contains sensitive information. The request is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt the communication channel. This can be achieved by changing the URL scheme from "http" to "https". Additionally, consider using a secure protocol like TLS to encrypt the data being transmitted. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

                           //...
                           
                     }
