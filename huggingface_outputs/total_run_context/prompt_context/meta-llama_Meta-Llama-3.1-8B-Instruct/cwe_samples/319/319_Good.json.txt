 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-319 because it transmits sensitive data (StorageAccountName) in cleartext. This is a potential security risk as an unauthorized actor can sniff the data in the communication channel. The "enableHttpsTrafficOnly" property is set to true, which is a good practice, but it does not prevent the transmission of sensitive data in cleartext.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a secure method to transmit sensitive data, such as encryption or a secure communication channel. One possible solution is to use Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve sensitive data. Additionally, ensure that all communication channels are properly configured to use HTTPS. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external control input to control the flow of control.

Code Sample:

		   
		    if (request.query["username"] == "admin") {
		       
		        // grant access
		       
		    } else {
		       
		        // deny access
		       
		    }
