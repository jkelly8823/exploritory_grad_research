VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not transmit sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext. The command is used to enable HTTPS-only for a storage account, which is a secure configuration. However, it's worth noting that the command itself is not transmitting any data, it's just updating the configuration of the storage account.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure in this context. However, it's always a good practice to ensure that the storage account is properly secured, including enabling firewall rules and access controls. Additionally, consider using Azure Policy to enforce secure configurations across your resources.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
