 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-319 because it transmits sensitive data (StorageAccountName) in cleartext. This is a security risk because an unauthorized actor can sniff the data in the communication channel. The "enableHttpsTrafficOnly" property is set to false, which means that the data is transmitted in cleartext.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the "enableHttpsTrafficOnly" property to true to ensure that sensitive data is transmitted over HTTPS.
2. Consider using a secure method to transmit sensitive data, such as encryption.
