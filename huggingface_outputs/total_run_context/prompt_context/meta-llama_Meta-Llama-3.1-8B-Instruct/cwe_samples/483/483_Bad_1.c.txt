 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not explicitly delimit a block that is intended to contain 2 or more statements, creating a logic error. This is a classic example of a missing semicolon or a missing block delimiter. In this case, the code is missing a semicolon after the Do_X() function call. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the condition is true, as the Do_Y() function will be executed regardless of the condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a semicolon after the Do_X() function call to explicitly delimit the block.
2. Consider using a code formatter to ensure consistent code style and prevent similar issues in the future. 
3. Review the code to ensure that the logic is correct and that the condition is being evaluated as expected.  ```c
if (condition==true) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
}
```  ```c
```c
if (condition==true) Do_X();Do_Y();
```c
```c
```c
if (condition==true) Do_X();Do_Y();
