 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not explicitly delimit a block that is intended to contain 2 or more statements, creating a logic error. This is a classic example of a missing semicolon or a missing block delimiter. In this case, the code is missing a semicolon after the Do_X() function call. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the code is executed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a semicolon after the Do_X() function call to explicitly delimit the block.
2. Consider using a code formatter or linter to catch such errors in the future. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all blocks are properly delimited to avoid similar issues.  ```c
if (condition==true)
{
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
}
```  ```c
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The code uses a function that is not declared or defined in the current scope, leading to undefined behavior.

Code Sample:

                  int x = 5;
                  int y = 10;
                  int z = x + y;
                  int result = add(x,y);
