 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-315 because it stores sensitive information (userAccountID) in a cookie in cleartext. This allows an attacker to intercept the cookie and gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a secure cookie with a secure flag and a random value. This will prevent the cookie from being transmitted in cleartext and reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, consider using a token-based authentication system to further secure the application.

                String data = scanner.nextLine();
                scanner.close();
                System.out.println(data);
