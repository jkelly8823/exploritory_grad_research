 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XPath injection attacks. The XPath expression is constructed by concatenating user input (login.getUserName() and login.getPassword()) without proper sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the XPath expression to retrieve sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a parameterized XPath expression to prevent injection attacks. This can be achieved by using the XPathExpression object's setParameter() method to set the values of the variables in the XPath expression.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input values to ensure they only contain expected characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to retrieve data from the XML database, such as using a database abstraction layer or an ORM framework. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses external input to construct a SQL query string without proper validation or sanitization of that input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially extract or modify sensitive data.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
