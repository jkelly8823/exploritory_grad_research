 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow condition. The strcpy function is used to copy the hostname into the hostname buffer without checking the length of the hostname. If the hostname is longer than 63 characters, it will overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent variables on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer function like strncpy to copy the hostname into the hostname buffer. The strncpy function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing a buffer overflow. For example: strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, 63); hostname[63] = '\0'; This will ensure that the hostname is copied into the buffer without overflowing it. Additionally, consider using a more secure function like gethostbyname to perform the hostname lookup, as it does not require the use of strcpy. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) vulnerability occurs when a program fails to properly restrict operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, allowing an attacker to access or modify memory outside the intended buffer.
