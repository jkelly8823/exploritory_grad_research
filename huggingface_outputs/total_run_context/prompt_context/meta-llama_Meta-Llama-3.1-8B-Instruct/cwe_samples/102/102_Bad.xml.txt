 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains two forms with the same name, "ProjectForm". This is a potential vulnerability as it may cause the Struts Validator to validate a form that the programmer does not expect. This is a classic example of CWE-102, where multiple validation forms have the same name.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, rename one of the forms to a unique name. For example, the second form could be renamed to "ProjectForm2". This will ensure that the Struts Validator validates the correct form. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that all forms have unique names to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```<form-validation>   <formset>     <form name="ProjectForm">... </form>     <form name="ProjectForm2">... </form>   </formset> </form-validation>```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```
