 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-117 because it does not properly handle the case where the "val" parameter is not a valid integer. In this case, the code catches the NumberFormatException and logs the error, but it does not prevent the error from being written to the logs. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious data into the logs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the log statement is executed even if an exception is thrown.
2. Use a more specific exception type, such as NumberFormatException, to catch the error and prevent it from being written to the logs.
3. Consider using a more robust input validation mechanism, such as a regular expression, to ensure that the "val" parameter is a valid integer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the syntax of input received from the network or some other external source.

Code Sample:

                  String val = request.getParameter("val");if (val!= null && val.length() > 0) {
                        // do something with val
                    }else {
