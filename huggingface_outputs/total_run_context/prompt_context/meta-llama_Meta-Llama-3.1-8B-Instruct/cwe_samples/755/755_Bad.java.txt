 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-755 because it does not handle the case where the IP address is not a valid hostname. If the IP address is not a valid hostname, the getHostName() method will return null, and the code will throw a NullPointerException when trying to concatenate the null value with the string "hello ". This is a potential security vulnerability because an attacker could potentially exploit this by sending a malicious IP address that is not a valid hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can add a null check before trying to concatenate the hostname with the string "hello ". For example, you can use the following code: if (addr.getHostName()!= null) { out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName()); } else { out.println("hello unknown"); } This will prevent the NullPointerException from being thrown and provide a more robust solution. Alternatively, you can use a try-catch block to catch the NullPointerException and handle it accordingly. For example: try { out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName()); } catch (NullPointerException e) { out.println("hello unknown"); } This will also prevent the NullPointerException from being thrown and provide a
