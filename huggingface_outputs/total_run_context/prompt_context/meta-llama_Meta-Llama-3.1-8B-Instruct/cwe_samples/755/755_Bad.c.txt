 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the exceptional condition of malloc failing to allocate memory. Although it checks if malloc failed, it does not take any action to handle the error, effectively ignoring it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the code attempts to use the allocated memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if malloc failed and handle the error by freeing the allocated memory and returning an error code or throwing an exception.
2. Use a more robust memory allocation function that can handle allocation failures, such as malloc or calloc with a non-zero size.
3. Consider using a smart pointer or a container that can handle memory management for you. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int x;
                  if (x > 5) {
                      printf("x is greater than 5");
                  }
