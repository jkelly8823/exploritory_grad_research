 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The <%= %> syntax is used to inject user input directly into the HTML output, which can lead to malicious scripts being executed. The input is not sanitized or validated, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a templating engine that supports safe interpolation, such as FreeMarker or Velocity.
2. Use a library like OWASP ESAPI to sanitize and validate user input.
3. Avoid using <%= %> syntax and instead use a safer method to inject user input, such as using a function that escapes special characters. 
4. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent XSS attacks.  ```python
def analyze_code(code):
    # Define the vulnerability pattern
    pattern = r'<%.*?%>'
    
    # Find all occurrences of the pattern in the code
    matches = re.findall(pattern, code)
    
    # Check if any matches are found
    if matches:
        # Extract the vulnerable lines
        vulnerable_lines = [match for match in matches]
        
        # Return the
