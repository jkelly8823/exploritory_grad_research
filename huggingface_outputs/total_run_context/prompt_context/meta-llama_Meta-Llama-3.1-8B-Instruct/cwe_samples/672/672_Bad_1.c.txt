 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-672 because it attempts to free the memory allocated by malloc twice. The first free is called when the abrt flag is set, and the second free is called at the end of the function. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Free the memory allocated by malloc only once, either when the abrt flag is set or at the end of the function. For example, you can remove the first free call and let the second free call handle the memory deallocation. Alternatively, you can introduce a flag to track whether the memory has already been freed and only free it if that flag is not set.
