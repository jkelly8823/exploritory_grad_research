 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-672 because it accesses the messageBody after it has been freed. This occurs when the processMessageBody function returns an error, and the code attempts to log the error message. The messageBody has already been freed in the previous line, resulting in a dangling pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the free(messageBody) call to after the logError function call to prevent the messageBody from being freed prematurely.
2. Consider using a smart pointer or a container to manage the memory of the messageBody, to avoid manual memory management and potential issues like this one. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product uses, accesses, or otherwise operates on a resource after that resource has been expired, released, or revoked.

Code Sample:

                #define FAIL 0#define SUCCESS 1#define ERROR -1#define MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE 32
                     int processMessage(char **message){
                        int result = SUCCESS;
                           int length = getMessageLength(message[0]);char *messageBody;
                           if ((length > 0) && (length < MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE
