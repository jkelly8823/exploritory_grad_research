 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-672 because it accesses the memory location pointed to by messageBody after it has been freed. This is because the free() function is called before the if statement that checks the success of processing the message body. If the processMessageBody() function fails, the memory location pointed to by messageBody is accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the free() call to after the if statement to ensure that the memory location is not accessed after it has been freed.
2. Consider using smart pointers or other memory management techniques to avoid manual memory management and potential memory leaks. 
3. Add error handling to ensure that the memory location is not accessed if the processMessageBody() function fails.  ```c
if (success == ERROR) {
    result = ERROR;
    logError("Error processing message", messageBody);
    free(messageBody);
}
``` 
should be changed to 
```c
if (success == ERROR) {
    result = ERROR;
    logError("Error processing message", messageBody);
}
free(messageBody);
``` 
This ensures that the memory location is
