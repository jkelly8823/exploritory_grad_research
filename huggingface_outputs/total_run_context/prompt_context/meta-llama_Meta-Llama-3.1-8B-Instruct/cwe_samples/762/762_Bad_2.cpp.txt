 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to dynamically allocate memory using the new operator when the heap parameter is true. However, it then attempts to deallocate this memory using delete[], which is intended for arrays allocated with new[]. This is a mismatch between the allocation and deallocation functions, which can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the correct deallocation function, delete, when deallocating memory allocated with new. Alternatively, use smart pointers or containers to manage memory automatically. For example, replace the line delete[] p; with delete p;. If heap is true, consider using a std::vector or std::array to manage the memory automatically.
