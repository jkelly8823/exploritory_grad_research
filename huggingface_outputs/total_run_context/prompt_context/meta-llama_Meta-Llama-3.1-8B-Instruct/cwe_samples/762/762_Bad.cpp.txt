 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the incorrect use of the free() function. The memory was allocated using the new operator, which returns a pointer to the allocated memory. However, the free() function is used to deallocate memory that was allocated using malloc(). This will result in undefined behavior and potentially cause a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the delete operator to deallocate memory that was allocated using the new operator. The corrected code should be:
void foo(){
                        BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
                           /* do some work with ptr here */
                           
                          ...
                           delete ptr;
                     } 
VULNERABILITY LIST:
