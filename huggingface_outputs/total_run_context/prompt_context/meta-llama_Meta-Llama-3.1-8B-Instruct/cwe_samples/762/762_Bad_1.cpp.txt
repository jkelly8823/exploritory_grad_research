 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the incorrect usage of malloc and delete. The malloc function is used to allocate memory on the heap, but the delete function is used to deallocate it. However, the delete function is not compatible with the malloc function, which can lead to undefined behavior and memory leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the new and delete operators instead of malloc and free. The correct code should be: int* ptr = new int; delete ptr; or use smart pointers to manage memory automatically. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product uses a function that is not thread-safe, but it is called from multiple threads.

Code Sample:

                  #include <iostream>
                  #include <thread>
                  void foo() {std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;}
                  int main() {std::thread t1(foo);std::thread t2(foo);t1.join();t2.join();return 0;}
