 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the use of the "new" operator to allocate memory for the BarObj object, but the "delete" operator is used to release the memory. However, the "delete" operator is not compatible with the "new" operator used to allocate the memory. This is because the "new" operator allocates memory on the heap, but the "delete" operator is used to release memory on the stack. To fix this, the code should use the "delete" operator to release the memory allocated by the "new" operator.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the "delete" operator with the "delete" operator that is compatible with the "new" operator used to allocate the memory. In this case, the code should use the "delete" operator to release the memory allocated by the "new" operator.
2. Consider using smart pointers, such as unique_ptr or shared_ptr, to manage memory and avoid memory leaks. This will ensure that the memory is released properly when it is no longer needed.
