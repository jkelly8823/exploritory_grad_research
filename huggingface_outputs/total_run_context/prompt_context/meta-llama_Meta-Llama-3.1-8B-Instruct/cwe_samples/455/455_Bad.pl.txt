 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle the case when GetCurrentUser() or GetStateData() fails to return a value. This could potentially lead to a security-relevant error during initialization. If GetStateData() fails to return a defined value, the code will attempt to extract the user ID from an undefined variable, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error handling to GetCurrentUser() and GetStateData() to ensure they return a defined value or throw an exception if they fail.
2. Check the return value of GetStateData() before attempting to extract the user ID.
3. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may be thrown by GetStateData().
