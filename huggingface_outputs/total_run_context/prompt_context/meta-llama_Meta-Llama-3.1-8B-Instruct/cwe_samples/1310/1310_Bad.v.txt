 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-1310 as it does not seem to be missing the ability to patch ROM code. The bootrom and bootrom_linux instances are properly configured and the rom_rdata is assigned based on the ariane_boot_sel_i signal. However, the rom_rdata is assigned to itself, which might be a logical error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the logic of the rom_rdata assignment to ensure it is correct.
2. Consider adding a patching mechanism for the ROM code to address CWE-1310. 
3. Ensure that the bootrom and bootrom_linux instances are properly configured and functional.  ```bash

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1310 because the bootrom and bootrom_linux instances are not properly configured. The rom_req and rom_addr signals are not connected to the bootrom instance, which means the ROM code cannot be patched.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Connect the rom_req and rom_addr signals to the bootrom instance.
2. Ensure that the
