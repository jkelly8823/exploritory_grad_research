 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to missing an ability to patch ROM code. The bootrom i_bootrom_patch and i_bootrom_linux instances are not patched, which may leave the system in a vulnerable state. The assign statement at line 9-10 does not address the vulnerability as it only selects between the two instances based on the ariane_boot_sel_i signal, but does not provide a mechanism to patch the ROM code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a patching mechanism to the bootrom instances, such as a patching signal or a patching module.
2. Modify the assign statement to include the patching mechanism, so that the ROM code can be patched accordingly. 3. Consider adding a reset mechanism to ensure that the system is in a known state after patching. 4. Verify that the patching mechanism is properly tested and validated to ensure that it works correctly. 5. Consider adding a mechanism to prevent unauthorized patching of the ROM code. 6. Document the patching mechanism and its usage in the code and documentation. 7. Consider adding a mechanism to track and record the patching history of the ROM
