 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of strcpy() function which does not perform bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location in the memory, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer function like strncpy() to prevent buffer overflows. Also, free the memory allocated for buf2 before reassigning it to a new value. The corrected code should be: char *buf1 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE); char *buf2 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE); strncpy(buf1, argv[1], BUFSIZE); free(buf2); buf2 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE); free(buf1); free(buf2); 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 122
CWE Description:
A condition where an attacker can cause a program to access memory outside of its intended bounds, often as the result of a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

                  #define BUFSIZE 256int main(int argc, char **argv) {char *buf1 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE);char *buf2 = (
