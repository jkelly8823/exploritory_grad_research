 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-1326. The always_ff block is used for sequential logic, and the raddr_q is being updated based on the req_i signal. However, the raddr_q is being checked against RomSize before accessing the memory, which prevents any potential out-of-bounds access. Additionally, the use of '0' as a default value for rdata_o when raddr_q is out of bounds suggests that the code is designed to handle such cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against CWE-1326. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 1326
CWE Description:
A missing immutable root of trust in the hardware results in the ability to bypass secure boot or execute untrusted or adversarial boot code. 

Code Sample:

						...
                            always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
                                if (req_i) begin
										raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3
