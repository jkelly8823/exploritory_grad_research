 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a missing immutable root of trust in the hardware due to the lack of secure boot mechanism. The always_ff block is sensitive to the clk_i signal, which can be manipulated by an attacker to bypass secure boot or execute untrusted or adversarial boot code. The use of the raddr_q variable to store the address of the memory location being accessed also introduces a potential vulnerability, as it can be modified by an attacker to access unauthorized memory locations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a secure boot mechanism to ensure that only trusted code is executed during boot.
2. Use a secure and immutable root of trust in the hardware to prevent manipulation of the clk_i signal.
3. Use a secure and tamper-evident memory access mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to memory locations. 
4. Validate the address being accessed to ensure it is within the valid range of the memory.
