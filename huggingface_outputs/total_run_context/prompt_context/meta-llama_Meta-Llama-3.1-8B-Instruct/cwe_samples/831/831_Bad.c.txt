 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a function handler that is used as a handler for two different signals, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. This is a potential vulnerability as it may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the signals are received in a specific order or concurrently. The signal function is used to install a signal handler, and in this case, the same handler function is used for both signals. This can cause issues if the handler function is not properly synchronized or if it has side effects that are not intended for the specific signal being handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should define separate signal handlers for each signal, or use a single handler function that is properly synchronized to handle both signals. For example, the code could use a switch statement to determine which signal was received and handle it accordingly. Alternatively, the code could use a single handler function that is designed to handle both signals and is properly synchronized to avoid any issues.
