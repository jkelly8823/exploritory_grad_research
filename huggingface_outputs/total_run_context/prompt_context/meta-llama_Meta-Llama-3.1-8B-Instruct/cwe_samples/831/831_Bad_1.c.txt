 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The function handler is registered to handle two different signals: SIGHUP and SIGTERM. This is a potential vulnerability as it may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the signals are received in a specific order or at the same time. The handler function is not designed to handle multiple signals concurrently, which can cause issues with the program's state and potentially lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use separate signal handlers for each signal to avoid potential conflicts and unexpected behavior.
2. Use a signal handler that can handle multiple signals concurrently, such as a signal handler that uses a mutex to protect shared resources.
3. Avoid using the sleep function in signal handlers, as it can cause the program to block and prevent it from responding to other signals. Instead, use a non-blocking function or a separate thread to handle the sleep function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a function that is not thread-safe.

Code Sample:

                  char *logMessage;
                     void handler (int sigNum) {
                        syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "%s\n", logMessage);free(log
