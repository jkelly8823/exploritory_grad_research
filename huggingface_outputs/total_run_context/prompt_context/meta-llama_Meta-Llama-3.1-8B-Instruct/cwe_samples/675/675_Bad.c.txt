 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-675 because it frees the memory allocated by malloc twice. The first free is called when the abrt flag is true, and the second free is called at the end of the function. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the first free statement to ensure the memory is only freed once.
2. Consider using smart pointers or RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) to manage memory and avoid manual memory management. 
3. If the abrt flag is intended to indicate an error, consider throwing an exception or returning an error code instead of freeing the memory. This will allow the caller to handle the error and avoid potential crashes.  ```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    // Do not free the memory here
}
...
free(ptr);
```  ```c
// Consider using smart pointers or RAII
std::unique_ptr<char> ptr = std::make_unique<char>(SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    // The memory will be automatically freed when ptr goes out of scope
}
