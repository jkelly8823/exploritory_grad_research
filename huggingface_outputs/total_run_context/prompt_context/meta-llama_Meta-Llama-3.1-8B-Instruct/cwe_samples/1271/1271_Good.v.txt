 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1271 because the lock_jtag signal is not set to a known value on reset. The lock_jtag signal is being set to 0 when the reset signal is active, but it is not being set to a known value when the reset signal is inactive. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the lock_jtag signal to a known value (e.g. 1) when the reset signal is inactive.
2. Consider using a reset value for the lock_jtag signal that is not 0, to avoid potential issues with the signal being set to an unknown value. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 120
CWE Description:
Use of a temporary variable in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

					always @(posedge clk) begin
					  
					    temp = {16{1'b0}};
					    temp[15:8] = {16{1'b0}};
					    temp[7:0] = {8{1'b0}};
					  
					  end
