 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-179 because it validates the input path by checking if it starts with "/safe_dir/", but it does not account for the possibility of an attacker manipulating the path after the validation. The getCanonicalPath() method can potentially modify the path, allowing an attacker to bypass the validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust validation method that takes into account the possibility of path manipulation after validation.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input path, where only specific, known-safe paths are allowed.
3. Avoid using methods like getCanonicalPath() that can modify the input path, and instead use a method that returns the original path. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user-controlled input for security-relevant characters, such as those used in SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
