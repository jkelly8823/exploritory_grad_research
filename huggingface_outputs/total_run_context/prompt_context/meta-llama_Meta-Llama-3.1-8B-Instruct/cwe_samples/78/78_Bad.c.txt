 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-78 because it uses the `strcat` function to concatenate user input (`argv[1]`) into a command string, which is then executed using `system`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the input string. The `strcat` function does not perform any sanitization or validation of the input, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to construct the command string, such as using `snprintf` or `sprintf` with format specifiers to prevent buffer overflows and ensure proper string formatting.
2. Validate and sanitize the user input to prevent malicious commands from being injected.
3. Consider using a more secure method to execute commands, such as using a library like `libssh2` or `libssh` to execute commands over SSH, which provides better security features and protection against command injection attacks.
