 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-78, a command injection vulnerability. The code constructs an OS command using user input from the "backuptype" parameter without properly sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data modification. The use of "cmd.exe /K" and the concatenation of the "rmanDB.bat" and "cleanup.bat" files with user input creates a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a library like Apache Commons Lang to properly escape special characters in the user input.
3. Consider using a more secure way to execute commands, such as using a ProcessBuilder or a library like Java Exec. 
4. Remove the use of "cmd.exe /K" and instead use a more secure way to execute the batch files. 
5. Consider using a more secure way to handle file paths, such as using a library like Java IO.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 78 CWE Description: The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced
