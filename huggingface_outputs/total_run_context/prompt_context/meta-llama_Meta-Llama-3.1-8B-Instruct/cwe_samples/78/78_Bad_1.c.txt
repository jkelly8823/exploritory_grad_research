 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-78 because it constructs an OS command using externally-influenced input from the argv[1] parameter without properly sanitizing it. The system() function executes the command, which can lead to arbitrary command execution if the input is not validated. The use of strncat() to concatenate the cat command and the user input is also a potential issue, as it does not prevent buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like snprintf() to construct the command string, ensuring that the input is properly sanitized and preventing buffer overflows.
2. Validate the user input to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters or commands.
3. Consider using a more secure function like execve() instead of system(), which allows for more fine-grained control over the command execution.
