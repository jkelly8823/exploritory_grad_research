 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-78 because it directly executes a system command using a script name that is obtained from an external source (System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME")). This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the SCRIPTNAME property. The use of System.exec() without proper validation or sanitization of the input makes the code susceptible to command injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input script name to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not contain any malicious commands.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, trusted scripts to be executed.
3. Use a more secure method to execute the script, such as using a ProcessBuilder or a library that provides a safer way to execute system commands. 
4. Avoid using System.getProperty() to obtain sensitive information, and instead use a more secure method to retrieve the script name. 
5. Consider using a sandboxed environment to execute the script, to prevent any potential damage to the system. 6. Always log and monitor the execution of system commands to detect any suspicious activity. 7. Consider using a library that provides a safer way to execute system commands, such
