 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-78 because it uses the output of the nslookup command as input to the escapeHTML function. This can lead to a command injection vulnerability if the output of the nslookup command contains special characters that can be interpreted by the escapeHTML function. The use of the pipe operator (|) to execute the nslookup command also makes the code vulnerable to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to execute the nslookup command, such as using a library that can execute commands safely.
2. Validate and sanitize the output of the nslookup command before passing it to the escapeHTML function.
3. Consider using a more secure method to execute the nslookup command, such as using a Perl module that can execute commands safely, such as IPC::Open3. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
