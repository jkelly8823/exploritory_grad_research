VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The user input from the $_POST["user"] variable is directly concatenated into the system command without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the user input. For example, an attacker could input "; ls -l /etc/passwd; " to execute the ls command on the /etc/passwd file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the user input from the system command.
2. Validate and sanitize the user input to prevent any malicious characters from being injected.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific commands or paths to be executed. 
4. Use a more secure method to execute system commands, such as using exec() or proc_open() with proper input validation. 
5. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in security features for executing system commands.  ```php
$command = 'ls -l /home/'. $userName;
``` 
should be replaced with 
```php
$command = 'ls -l /home/'. escapeshellarg($userName);
```
