 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to password reuse attacks because the password is stored in a recoverable format. The password is stored in plain text within the connection string, which can be accessed by malicious users or system administrators. This makes it possible for attackers to use the password on other accounts.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store the password, such as hashing and salting.
2. Avoid storing passwords in plain text within the connection string.
3. Consider using a secure connection string storage mechanism, such as a secrets manager. 
4. Regularly review and update the connection string to ensure it is secure. 
5. Consider implementing a password policy that enforces strong passwords and regular password rotation. 6. Consider using a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect. 7. Consider using a secure connection string encryption mechanism, such as SSL/TLS. 8. Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password vault. 9. Consider implementing a password expiration policy. 10. Consider implementing a password history policy. 11. Consider implementing a password complexity policy. 12. Consider implementing a password lock
