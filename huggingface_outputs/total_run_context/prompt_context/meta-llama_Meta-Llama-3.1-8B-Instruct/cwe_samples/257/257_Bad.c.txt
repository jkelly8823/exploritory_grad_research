 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to password reuse attacks because it stores the password in a recoverable format. The password is compressed and compared to a stored compressed password. This allows an attacker to obtain the password by recovering the compressed password and then decompressing it. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 to store passwords securely.
2. Avoid storing passwords in a recoverable format. Instead, store a hashed version of the password.
3. Consider using a library like OpenSSL to handle password storage securely. 
4. Always use a salt value when hashing passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks. 
5. Consider implementing a password policy that requires strong and unique passwords for all users. 
6. Regularly review and update password storage mechanisms to ensure they remain secure. 
7. Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage passwords. 
8. Always use secure communication protocols when transmitting passwords, such as HTTPS. 
9. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication to add an additional layer of security. 
10. Regularly monitor and audit password storage mechanisms to detect potential security issues.
