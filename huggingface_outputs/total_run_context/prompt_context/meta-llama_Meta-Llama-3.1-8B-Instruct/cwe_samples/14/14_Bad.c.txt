 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-14 because the memset function is used to clear the password, but the compiler may optimize away the memset call if the password is not used again. This is because the compiler may perform "dead store removal," which removes unnecessary assignments to variables that are not used again. To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a compiler directive to disable dead store removal or use a different method to clear the password that is not subject to compiler optimizations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the compiler directive "-fno-dead-store-removal" to disable dead store removal.
2. Use a different method to clear the password, such as using a loop to overwrite the password with a random value. 
3. Use a secure method to clear the password, such as using a secure erase function provided by the compiler or a third-party library. 
4. Avoid using compiler optimizations that may remove the memset call, such as disabling optimization or using a different compiler. 
5. Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password hashing library, to store the password securely.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID:
