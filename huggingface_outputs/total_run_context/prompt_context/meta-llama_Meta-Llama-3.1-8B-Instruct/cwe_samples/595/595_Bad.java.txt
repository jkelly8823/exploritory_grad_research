 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not demonstrate the CWE-595 vulnerability. The comparison operator '==' is used to compare the references of the two String objects, but the objects themselves are created with the same string literal "Hello". However, the Java compiler may cache string literals, which could potentially lead to the same object being created for both variables. Nevertheless, the comparison operator '==' is not the correct way to compare the contents of the objects. To fix this, the code should use the equals() method to compare the contents of the objects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the equals() method to compare the contents of the objects instead of the '==' operator. For example: if (str1.equals(str2)) {System.out.println("str1.equals(str2)");} 
VULNERABILITY LIST:  None  - CWE-595 is not present in this code sample.  However, the code sample does demonstrate a potential issue with string literal caching in Java. This is not a vulnerability in the classical sense, but rather a quirk of the Java language. It is worth noting that the equals() method will correctly compare the contents of the objects, even if they
