 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The attacker can repeatedly send login attempts until the maximum number of attempts is reached. This can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a rate limiting mechanism to limit the number of login attempts within a certain time frame. This can be achieved by storing the IP address and timestamp of each login attempt in a database and checking against this database before allowing a new login attempt. Additionally, consider implementing a CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not properly handle the case where the input to a function call is a null pointer.

Code Sample:

                  char *str = NULL;printf("%s", str);

            

This concludes your task. Provide your response here: 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If the input string is null, the printf function will attempt to access memory at address 0, leading to a segmentation fault.
