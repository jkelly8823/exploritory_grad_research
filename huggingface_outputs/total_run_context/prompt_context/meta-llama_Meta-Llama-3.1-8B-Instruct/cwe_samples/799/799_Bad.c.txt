 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-799: Excessive Data Exposure. The while loop continuously accepts user input until a valid user is authenticated. This can lead to excessive data exposure as the server will continue to accept and process user input even after a valid user has been authenticated. This can be exploited by an attacker to send multiple requests to the server, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a limit on the number of incoming requests to prevent excessive data exposure.
2. Use a more secure authentication mechanism that does not rely on a while loop to continuously accept user input.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as HTTPS, to encrypt user input and prevent eavesdropping attacks.
