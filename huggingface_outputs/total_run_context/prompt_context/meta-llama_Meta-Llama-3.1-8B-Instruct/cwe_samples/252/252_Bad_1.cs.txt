 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value from the Read method of the FileStream object. This can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions. The Read method can return 0 if the end of the file is reached, or a negative number if an I/O error occurs. The code does not check for these conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check the return value of the Read method and handle any errors that may occur. For example, you can check if the return value is less than the number of bytes read, and if so, handle the error accordingly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not check for buffer overflow conditions when copying data from one buffer to another.

Code Sample:

                Dim MyFile As New FileStream("myfile.txt", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read)Dim MyArray(50) As ByteMyFile.Read(MyArray, 0, 50)Dim MyBuffer(100) As ByteArray.Copy(MyArray, MyBuffer, 50)
