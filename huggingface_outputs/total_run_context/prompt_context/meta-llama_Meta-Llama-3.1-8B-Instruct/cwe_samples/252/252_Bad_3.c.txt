VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The function host_lookup does not check the return value from the function inet_addr, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions. The function inet_addr returns 0 in the event of an error, but this value is not checked. This can lead to a null pointer dereference when the function gethostbyaddr is called with a null pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check the return value of inet_addr and handle the error condition appropriately. This can be done by checking if the return value is 0 and if so, handle the error by returning an error code or throwing an exception. For example:
```c
in_addr_t addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);
if (addr == 0) {
    // handle error
    return -1;
}
