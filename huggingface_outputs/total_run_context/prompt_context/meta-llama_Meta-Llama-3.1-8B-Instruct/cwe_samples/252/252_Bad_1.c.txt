EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value from the returnChunkSize function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions. The returnChunkSize function is called with the argument destBuf, but the return value is not checked before being used in the memcpy function. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the return value is -1, indicating an error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of returnChunkSize function before using it in the memcpy function.
2. Handle the error case where returnChunkSize returns -1, for example by returning an error code or throwing an exception. 
3. Consider adding a check to ensure that destBuf is not null before passing it to returnChunkSize function. 
4. Consider adding a check to ensure that srcBuf is not null before passing it to memcpy function. 5. Consider adding a check to ensure that the size of srcBuf is greater than or equal to the size returned by returnChunkSize function. 6. Consider adding a check to ensure that the size of destBuf is greater than or equal to the size returned by returnChunkSize function. 7. Consider adding a check
