 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-252 because it does not check the return value of the fgets function. If fgets fails to read any data, it will return NULL, but the code does not check for this condition before passing the returned value to the strcpy function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the fgets function fails to read any data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of fgets before passing the returned value to strcpy. If fgets returns NULL, handle the error accordingly.
2. Use a safer function like strncpy to copy the string, which can prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable-length array (VLA) that is not initialized before use.

Code Sample:

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    int arr[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = i;
    }
    return 0;
}
