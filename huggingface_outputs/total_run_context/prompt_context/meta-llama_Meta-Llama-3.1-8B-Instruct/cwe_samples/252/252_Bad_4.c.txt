 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The function f() does not check the return value of pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock(). If pthread_mutex_lock() fails, the mutex is not locked, and the function will continue to access the shared resource without acquiring the lock. Similarly, if pthread_mutex_unlock() fails, the mutex is not unlocked, and the function will continue to access the shared resource without releasing the lock. This can lead to unexpected states and conditions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() to ensure that the mutex is successfully locked and unlocked.
2. Use a loop to retry the lock operation if pthread_mutex_lock() fails, to prevent the function from continuing to access the shared resource without acquiring the lock.
3. Use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown by pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock(), to prevent the function from continuing to access the shared resource without acquiring or releasing the lock.
