 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check the return value from the System.getProperty() method, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions. This is a potential issue because the System.clearProperty() method does not guarantee that the property will be removed, and the System.getProperty() method may still return the original value. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on the property being cleared.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of System.getProperty() to ensure it is not null before using it.
2. Use a more robust method to clear the property, such as using a Properties object to store and retrieve the property values.
