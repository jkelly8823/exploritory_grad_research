 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-829 because it includes a script from an external domain (externalDomain.example.com) which is outside of the intended control sphere. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the page.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include the weather widget script from a trusted source or implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of scripts that can be executed on the page. Consider using a library like jQuery to load the script dynamically and ensure it is properly sanitized. Additionally, ensure that the login form is properly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
