 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-382 because it uses System.exit() in the catch block of the doPost() method. This can cause the J2EE application to shut down its container, leading to potential data loss and other issues. The System.exit() call is not necessary in this context, as the application can handle the exception and continue running.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the System.exit() call from the catch block.
2. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as logging the exception and continuing with the application.
3. If the application requires a shutdown, consider using a more controlled shutdown mechanism, such as a shutdown hook, to ensure that resources are properly released.  ```java
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
        // Remove the System.exit() call
        // Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism
    }
}
```  ```java
// Example of a more robust error handling mechanism
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException
