 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not check if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array. This can cause the program to access memory outside the bounds of the array, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the condition in the if statement to check if the index is less than or equal to the length of the array.
2. Remove the line that accesses the array with an invalid index when the index is out of bounds. This line is unnecessary and can cause the program to crash. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program does not properly validate the length of the array before accessing it.

Code Sample:

                  int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
                        
                           int value;
                           
                           // check that the array index is less than the maximum
                           
                           
                           // length of the array
                           if (index < len) {
                              
                                 
                                 // get the value at the specified index of the array
                                 value = array[index];
                           }
                           // if array index is invalid then output error message
