 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the index is within the valid range before accessing the array, preventing buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is already secure against this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  
                    ...
                     
                     // declare a variable
                     int x;
                     // use the variable
                     if (x == 0) {
                    ...
