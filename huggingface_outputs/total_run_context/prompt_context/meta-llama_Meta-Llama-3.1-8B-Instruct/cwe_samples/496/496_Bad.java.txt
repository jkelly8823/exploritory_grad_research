 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-496 because the setUserRoles method allows public data to be assigned to a private array. This is equivalent to giving public access to the array, which can lead to unintended modifications or exposure of sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the setUserRoles method to a private method to prevent public access to the array.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a setter method with validation or using a secure data structure that enforces access control. 
3. If the array is not intended to be modified externally, consider making it final to prevent reassignment. 
4. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a List or a Set, that enforces access control and provides additional security features. 
5. Review the code to ensure that there are no other potential vulnerabilities or security issues.
