 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-698 because it executes additional code after sending a redirect to another location. The line `http_redirect($errorPageURL);` sends a redirect, but the script does not exit after that. The next line `echo $status;` executes additional code, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the script should exit after sending the redirect. This can be achieved by adding `exit;` after the `http_redirect($errorPageURL);` line. The corrected code should look like this: `http_redirect($errorPageURL); exit;`. This ensures that the script terminates after sending the redirect, preventing any additional code from being executed.
