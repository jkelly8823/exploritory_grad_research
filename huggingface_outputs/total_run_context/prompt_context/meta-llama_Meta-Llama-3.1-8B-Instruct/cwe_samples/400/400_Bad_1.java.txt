 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource exhaustion attack. The server continuously accepts new connections without any limit, causing the server to consume increasing amounts of resources. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the server is overwhelmed with connections. The while loop in the code runs indefinitely until the serverSocket.close() method is called, which is not guaranteed to happen in a timely manner. This can cause the server to consume all available resources, leading to a resource exhaustion attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a connection limit to prevent the server from accepting an unlimited number of connections.
2. Use a thread pool to manage the threads created for each client connection, rather than creating a new thread for each connection.
3. Consider using a connection timeout to limit the amount of time the server spends waiting for new connections. 
4. Regularly monitor the server's resource usage to detect potential resource exhaustion attacks. 
5. Implement a mechanism to close the serverSocket when the server is no longer needed to prevent resource leaks.
