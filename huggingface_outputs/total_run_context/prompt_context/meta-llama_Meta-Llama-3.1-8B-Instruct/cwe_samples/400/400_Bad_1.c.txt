 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to resource exhaustion due to the lack of error handling in the openFileToWrite function. If this function fails, the file will not be closed, and the socket will not be closed, leading to resource leaks. Additionally, the code does not check if the file is already open before attempting to open it again, which can also lead to resource exhaustion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error handling to the openFileToWrite function to ensure that the file is properly closed in case of an error.
2. Check if the file is already open before attempting to open it again.
3. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during file operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used, leading to undefined behavior.

Code Sample:

                  int writeDataFromSocketToFile(char *host, int port){
                        
                           char filename[FILENAME_SIZE];char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];int socket = openSocketConnection(host, port);
                           if (socket < 0) {printf("Unable to
