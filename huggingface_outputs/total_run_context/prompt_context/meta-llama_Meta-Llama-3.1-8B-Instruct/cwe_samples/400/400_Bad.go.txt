 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the improper handling of the `r.Body` reader. The `io.ReadAll` function reads the entire request body into memory, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the request body is large. Additionally, the `r.Body` reader is not closed after use, which can cause the underlying connection to remain open, leading to resource leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a streaming approach to read the request body, such as using a `bufio.Reader` or a `ioutil.NopCloser` to avoid reading the entire body into memory.
2. Close the `r.Body` reader after use to prevent resource leaks.
3. Consider using a middleware to limit the size of the request body to prevent DoS attacks.
