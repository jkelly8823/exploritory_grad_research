 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption. This is because the `MaxBytesReader` function is used to limit the size of the request body, but the `io.ReadAll` function is not guaranteed to stop reading once the maximum size is reached. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker sends a large request body.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust function like `io.LimitReader` to limit the size of the request body, which will stop reading once the maximum size is reached.
2. Check the error returned by `io.ReadAll` to handle cases where the maximum size is exceeded. For example, you can return a 413 Payload Too Large error to the client. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user-controlled input for security-relevant characters or bytes before using it in a security-sensitive operation.

Code Sample:

                  func serve(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
                     
                        var body []byte
                        const MaxRespBodyLength = 1e6
