 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the lack of memory deallocation for the 'body' pointer. The 'processMessageBody' function is called with the 'body' pointer, but there is no mechanism to free the memory allocated for the 'body' pointer. This can lead to a memory leak if the 'processMessage' function is called repeatedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a call to 'free' to deallocate the memory allocated for the 'body' pointer after it is no longer needed. For example, add the line 'free(body);' after the call to 'processMessageBody(body);'.
2. Consider using a smart pointer or a container class to manage the memory for the 'body' pointer, which can help prevent memory leaks and make the code more robust. 
3. Review the 'processMessageBody' function to ensure that it does not modify the 'body' pointer in a way that would cause the memory to be leaked. 
4. Consider using a memory pool or a memory manager to manage the memory for the 'body' pointer, which can help prevent memory leaks and make the code more efficient.
