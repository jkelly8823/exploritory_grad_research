 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to spoofing attacks due to the incorrect implementation of the authentication scheme. The line `if (inet_ntoa(cli.sin_addr)==getTrustedAddress())` checks if the client's IP address matches the trusted address, but this is not a secure way to authenticate a client. An attacker can easily spoof the client's IP address by sending a packet with a forged source IP address. This can be done using tools like `hping3` or `scapy`. To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure authentication mechanism, such as SSL/TLS or a challenge-response authentication scheme.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure authentication mechanism, such as SSL/TLS or a challenge-response authentication scheme.
2. Use a secure way to store and compare the trusted address, such as using a hash function or a secure storage mechanism.
3. Consider using a more secure way to bind the socket, such as using `SO_REUSEADDR` or `SO_REUSEPORT` to allow the socket to be reused after it has been closed.
