VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The function simple_digest() is vulnerable to a reflection attack. This is because it uses the EVP_get_digestbyname() function to get the digest algorithm, which can be used to impersonate a trusted user. The EVP_get_digestbyname() function does not perform any authentication checks on the algorithm name, so a malicious user can use the target machine to impersonate a trusted user.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to authenticate the algorithm name, such as using a whitelist of allowed algorithms.
2. Use a secure method to generate the password and command, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
3. Consider using a more secure digest algorithm, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3. 
4. Use a secure method to free the memory allocated by EVP_DigestFinal(), such as using a smart pointer or a container class. 
5. Consider using a secure library, such as OpenSSL 1.1.0 or later, which has improved security features. 
6. Consider using a secure protocol, such as TLS, to protect the password and command. 
7. Consider using a secure method to store the password and
