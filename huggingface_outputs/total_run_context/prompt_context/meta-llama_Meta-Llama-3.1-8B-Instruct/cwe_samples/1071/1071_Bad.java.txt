 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain an empty block. However, it does contain a division by zero operation, which is a potential vulnerability. The catch block is present to handle the ArithmeticException that will be thrown when the division by zero occurs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the divisor (b) is not zero before performing the division. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if b is zero before the division operation. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```java
if (b!= 0) {
   c = a / b;
} else {
   System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
}
```

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The source code contains a catch block that catches a specific exception type (ArithmeticException) but does not handle it properly.

Code Sample:

                  public class Main {
                     public static void main(String[] args) {
                        int a = 1;
                        int b = 0;
                        int c = 0;
                        try {
                           c = a / b;
