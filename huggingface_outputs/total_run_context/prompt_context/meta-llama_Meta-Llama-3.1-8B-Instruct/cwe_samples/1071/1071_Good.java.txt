 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does contain a division by zero operation, but it is properly handled by a try-catch block. The ArithmeticException is caught and the code sets the variable c to -1 when the division by zero occurs. This is a valid and safe way to handle this situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is safe and handles the division by zero operation correctly. However, it would be beneficial to consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as throwing a custom exception or logging the error with a higher level of detail. Additionally, the variable c could be initialized to a default value to avoid potential issues with its initial state. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code does not properly handle the case where the input is null.

Code Sample:

                  public class Main {
                     public static void main(String[] args) {
                        String str = null;
                        System.out.println(str.length());
                     }
                  }
