 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to brute force attacks due to the lack of rate limiting on authentication attempts. The sleep function is used to introduce a delay, but this is not a reliable method to prevent brute force attacks. A more robust solution would be to implement a rate limiting mechanism, such as a token bucket algorithm, to limit the number of authentication attempts within a short time frame.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a rate limiting mechanism, such as a token bucket algorithm, to limit the number of authentication attempts within a short time frame. This can be achieved by using a library such as Redis or Memcached to store the authentication attempts and their timestamps. Additionally, consider implementing a CAPTCHA or other challenge-response mechanism to further prevent brute force attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

Code Sample:

                  $username = $_POST['username'];$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";$result = mysqli_query($db, $query);
