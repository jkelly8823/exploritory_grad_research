 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to brute force attacks due to the lack of a mechanism to limit the number of failed authentication attempts within a short time frame. The while loop will continue indefinitely if the user enters incorrect credentials, allowing an attacker to try multiple combinations of usernames and passwords without any restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a mechanism to limit the number of failed authentication attempts within a short time frame, such as a counter that increments with each failed attempt and resets after a certain time period. This can be achieved by introducing a new variable to track the number of failed attempts and adding a conditional statement to break the loop after a certain number of attempts. For example:
```c
int maxFailedAttempts = 3;
int failedAttempts = 0;
while (isValidUser == 0) {
    if (getNextMessage(socket, username, USERNAME_SIZE) > 0) {
        if (getNextMessage(socket, password, PASSWORD_SIZE) > 0) {
            isValidUser = AuthenticateUser(username, password);
            if (!isValidUser) {
                failedAttempts++;
                if (failedAttempts >= maxFailedAttempts) {
                    break;
                }
            }
