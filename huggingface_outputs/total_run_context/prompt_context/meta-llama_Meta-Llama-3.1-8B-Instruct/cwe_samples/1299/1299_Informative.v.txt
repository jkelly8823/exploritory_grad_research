 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1299 due to the lack of protection on alternate paths to access control-protected assets. In this case, the `acl_oh_allowlist` register is assigned a fixed value of `32'h8312` without any authentication or authorization checks. This allows an attacker to bypass the existing protections and access the asset by manipulating the `incoming_id` input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication and authorization checks for the `acl_oh_allowlist` register to ensure that only authorized access is allowed.
2. Consider using a more secure method to assign values to the `acl_oh_allowlist` register, such as using a secure random number generator or a trusted source.
3. Review the code to ensure that all access to control-protected assets is properly authenticated and authorized.
