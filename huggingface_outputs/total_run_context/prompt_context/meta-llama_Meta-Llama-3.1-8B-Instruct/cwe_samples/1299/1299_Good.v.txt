 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1299 because it checks for two specific addresses (32'hF00 and 32'h800F00) and assigns a value to addr_auth based on this check. However, this check does not cover all possible alternate paths to access control-protected assets. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by accessing the asset through an alternate path that is not covered by the check.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for all possible alternate paths to access control-protected assets, not just the two specific addresses. This could be achieved by using a more comprehensive check, such as a regular expression or a more robust address validation mechanism. Additionally, it would be beneficial to implement additional security measures, such as access control lists or encryption, to further protect the asset. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The use of a hardcoded value in a security decision.

Code Sample:
if (address == 32'hF00) {
    // grant access
}
