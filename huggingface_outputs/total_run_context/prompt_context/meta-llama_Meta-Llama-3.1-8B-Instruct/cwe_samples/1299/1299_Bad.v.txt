 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to CWE-1299. The condition in the if statement is checking if the address is equal to a specific value (32'hF00), and if so, it assigns a value of 1 to addr_auth. This does not appear to be an alternate path to access control-protected assets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure. However, it would be beneficial to review the overall system design to ensure that all possible paths to access control-protected assets are properly protected.
