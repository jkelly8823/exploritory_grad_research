 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code declares an array 'urls' as public, final, and static. However, the 'final' keyword only prevents the reference to the array from being reassigned, not the contents of the array itself. This means that the array's contents can still be modified, which is a security risk. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the 'final' keyword should be removed from the array declaration, or the array should be declared as 'final' and its contents should be initialized at the time of declaration. Alternatively, the array should be declared as 'final' and its contents should be copied to a new array when the contents are modified. This will ensure that the array's contents cannot be modified after it is declared.
