 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-599 vulnerability because it does not check the SSL verification result. Although the code has a commented out line that checks the verification result, it is not being executed. This means that the code does not ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Uncomment the line that checks the verification result and ensure that it is executed. This can be done by removing the comment and adding a conditional statement to handle the case where the verification fails. For example:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
    foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if (X509_V_OK!= foo) {
        // handle verification failure
    }
}
``` 
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
    foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if (X509_V_OK!= foo) {
        // handle verification failure
    }
}
``` 
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
