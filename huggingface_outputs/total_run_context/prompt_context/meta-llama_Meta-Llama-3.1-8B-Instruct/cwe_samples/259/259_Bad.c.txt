 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded password "Mew!" which is used for authentication. This is a security risk as an attacker could potentially obtain the password and use it to gain unauthorized access to the system. The password is hardcoded in the VerifyAdmin function, which makes it easily accessible to anyone who has access to the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store the password, such as hashing and salting.
2. Use a secure method to verify the password, such as using a password verification function.
3. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information like passwords in the code. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file.
