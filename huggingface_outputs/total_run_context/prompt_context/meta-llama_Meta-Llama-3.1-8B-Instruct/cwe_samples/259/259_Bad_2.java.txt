 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded password, which is a security risk. Hard-coded passwords can be easily accessed by unauthorized users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system. This is a clear indication of a vulnerability in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information like passwords.
2. Consider using a secrets management tool to securely store and manage sensitive data.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that sensitive information is not hardcoded.

                     System.out.println("x is greater than 10");
                     }
                     x = 5;
