 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-259 because it contains a hard-coded password ("tiger") which is used for database connection. Hard-coded passwords are a security risk as they can be easily discovered by an attacker, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve database credentials, such as environment variables or a secrets manager.
2. Consider using a connection pool to manage database connections and reduce the risk of password exposure.
3. Regularly review and update database credentials to ensure they are secure and not hardcoded. 4. Consider using a library or framework that supports secure password storage and retrieval. 5. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information like database credentials in the code. 6. Use a secure protocol for database connections, such as SSL/TLS. 7. Consider using a database that supports secure authentication mechanisms, such as Kerberos or LDAP. 8. Regularly monitor database connections and credentials for potential security issues. 9. Consider implementing a password policy to enforce strong passwords for database credentials. 10. Use a secure method to store and retrieve database credentials, such as a
