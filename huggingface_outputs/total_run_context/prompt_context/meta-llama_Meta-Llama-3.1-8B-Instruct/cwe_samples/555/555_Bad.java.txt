 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code stores plaintext passwords in a configuration file, which is a clear violation of security best practices. This makes it vulnerable to password disclosure and potential unauthorized access to the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Store passwords securely using a secrets manager or an encrypted configuration file. Consider using environment variables or a secure key-value store to store sensitive information. Additionally, ensure that the application is configured to use a secure authentication mechanism, such as SSL/TLS, to protect password transmission. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
