 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-379 because it creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file. The tmpfile() function creates a temporary file in the directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable, which may not be secure. An attacker could potentially access the temporary file and determine its existence or contents.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to create a temporary file, such as tmpfile_s() or mkstemp(), which creates a file in a directory with secure permissions.
2. Ensure that the TMPDIR environment variable is set to a secure directory, such as /tmp or a similar directory with restricted permissions.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure temporary file creation, such as the OpenSSL library. 
4. Always check the return value of tmpfile() to ensure that the file was created successfully before attempting to write to it. 
5. Remove the temporary file as soon as it is no longer needed to prevent unauthorized access. 
6. Consider using a secure method to remove the temporary file, such as unlink() or remove(), which can be used
