 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
EXPLANATION:
The code creates a temporary file in the default temporary file directory, which may have permissions that allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file. This is a potential security risk because an attacker could potentially use this information to infer the existence of sensitive data or to launch a denial-of-service attack by deleting the temporary file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a directory with more restrictive permissions, such as the user's home directory, or using a library that provides a secure way to create temporary files. Additionally, ensure that the temporary file is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed to prevent an attacker from accessing it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product generates error messages that may reveal sensitive information.

Code Sample:

                  try {File temp = File.createTempFile("pattern", ".suffix");temp.deleteOnExit();BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(temp));out.write("aString");out.close();}catch (IOException e) {System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());}
