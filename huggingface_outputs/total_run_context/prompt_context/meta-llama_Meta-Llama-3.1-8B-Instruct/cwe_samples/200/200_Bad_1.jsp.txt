 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-200: Information Exposure Through Comments. The line of code that reads "User account number: <%= acctNo %>" is exposing sensitive information (the account number) to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This is because the code is only conditionally executed when the "debugEnabled" property is set to true, which could potentially be set by an unauthorized actor.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the code snippet that exposes sensitive information.
2. Use a more secure method to expose sensitive information, such as a secure logging mechanism.
3. Ensure that the "debugEnabled" property is only set to true by authorized personnel. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89

The product generates error messages that may reveal sensitive information.

Code Sample:

try {
    // some code that may throw an exception

    out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
