 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-200 as it is exposing sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. The error message indicates that the user 'root@localhost' is trying to connect to the database using a password 'N1nj4'. This information should not be exposed to anyone, especially not in a production environment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that error messages do not contain sensitive information.
2. Implement proper error handling to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle database connections, such as using environment variables or a secrets manager. 
4. Update the password to a more secure one. 
5. Limit access to the database to only necessary users and services. 
6. Regularly review and update the database connection settings to ensure they are secure. 7. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against SQL injection attacks. 8. Implement a secure password policy for database users. 9. Use a secure protocol for database connections, such as SSL/TLS. 10. Regularly monitor database activity for suspicious behavior. 11. Consider using a database auditing tool to track changes
