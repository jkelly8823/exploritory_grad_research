 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-200 as it exposes sensitive information (MySQL configuration file location) to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This is because the exception message includes the configuration file location, which could potentially be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid exposing sensitive information in exception messages. Instead, log the exception and configuration file location securely, and display a generic error message to the user.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve sensitive information, such as environment variables or a secure configuration file.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent sensitive information from being exposed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

Code Sample:

                  $username = $_POST['username'];
                  $password = $_POST['password'];
                  $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";
                  $result = mysql_query($query);
                  if ($result) {
                      // login successful
