 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. The android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission allows the app to access the device's location, which is sensitive information. This permission is declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file, making it accessible to anyone who can view the file, including users who have not explicitly granted the app permission to access their location.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the permission declaration to the AndroidManifest.xml file's <application> tag, which is only accessible to the app's package manager. This will prevent users from viewing the permission without installing the app.
2. Use the <uses-permission-sdk-23> tag instead of <uses-permission> to declare the permission, which will only be enforced on Android 6.0 and later devices. This will prevent users from viewing the permission on older devices.
3. Use the <uses-permission> tag with the android:protectionLevel attribute set to "signature" to restrict the permission to only be accessible to the app's package manager. This will prevent users from viewing the permission.
