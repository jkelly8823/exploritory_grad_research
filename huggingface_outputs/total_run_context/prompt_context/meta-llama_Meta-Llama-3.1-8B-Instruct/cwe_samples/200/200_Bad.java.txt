 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The query string is directly concatenated with the username and accountNumber variables, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a classic example of a CWE-200 vulnerability. The query string should be parameterized to prevent this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Use a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the database connection is properly closed.
3. Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract away the database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
