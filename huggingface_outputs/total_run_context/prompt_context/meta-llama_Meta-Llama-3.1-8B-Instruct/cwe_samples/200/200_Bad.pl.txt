 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-200 because it exposes the username and password to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This is because the code retrieves the username and password from the 'param' function, which likely retrieves the values from the HTTP request parameters. This means that an attacker can manipulate the request parameters to obtain the username and password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to authenticate users, such as using a library that handles authentication securely.
2. Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as bcrypt or PBKDF2, to store passwords securely. 
4. Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and server. 
5. Implement a secure way to handle errors and exceptions, such as logging and displaying error messages securely. 6. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks. 7. Regularly update and patch the application to ensure it has the latest security fixes. 8. Implement a secure way to handle user sessions
