 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-200 as it exposes the current user's location to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This is because the getLastLocation() method is called without any authentication or authorization checks. Additionally, the error message and log statement contain sensitive information about the user, which could be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication and authorization checks before calling the getLastLocation() method.
2. Remove sensitive information from the error message and log statement.
3. Consider using a secure logging mechanism to prevent sensitive information from being logged. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user input, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {
    if (location!= null) {
        if (location.getLatitude() > 90 || location.getLatitude() < -90) {
            Log.e("ExampleActivity", "Latitude is out of range");
        }
        if (location.getLongitude() > 180 || location.getLongitude() < -180) {
            Log.e("ExampleActivity",
