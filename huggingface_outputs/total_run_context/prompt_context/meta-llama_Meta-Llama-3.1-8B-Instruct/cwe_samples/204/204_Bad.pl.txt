 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-204 because it reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor. In this case, the code prints different messages based on whether the username is valid and whether the password is correct. An attacker could potentially use this information to determine if a username exists or not, which could be used to launch a brute-force attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of printing different messages, return a generic error message that does not reveal any information about the internal state of the system.
2. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as a challenge-response authentication system.
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input without proper validation as part of its internal logic flow, leading to an unexpected behavior.

Code Sample:

                  my $username=param('username');
                  my $password=param('password');
                  
                  if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
                  {
                  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
                  {
                  print "Login Successful";
                  }
