 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-94 because it uses the contents of the "messages.out" file directly in the include statement without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the file, which can be executed when the file is included. The fwrite statement also allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the file, which can be executed when the file is included.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure that only expected characters are written to the file.
2. Use a templating engine or a secure method to include the file, such as using a require_once statement with a secure path.
3. Consider using a database to store messages instead of a file, which would eliminate the risk of code injection. 
4. Always validate and sanitize user input before writing it to a file or including it in the code. 
5. Use a secure method to open the file, such as using fopen with the 'r' mode instead of 'a+', which would prevent an attacker from overwriting the file. 
6. Consider using a secure logging mechanism, such as a logging library,
