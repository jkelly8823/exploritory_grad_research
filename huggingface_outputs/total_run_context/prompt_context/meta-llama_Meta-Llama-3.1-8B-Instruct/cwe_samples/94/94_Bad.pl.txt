 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-94 because it uses the eval function to execute a string that is constructed from user input. The user input is not sanitized or validated, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code. In this case, the user input is the 'action' parameter, which is used to construct the code string that is executed by eval. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious action, such as deleting a critical file or executing a system command, by manipulating the 'action' parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize and validate the 'action' parameter to ensure it only contains allowed values.
2. Use a safer alternative to eval, such as a code generation library or a templating engine.
3. Avoid using eval whenever possible, as it can pose a significant security risk. Instead, use explicit function calls or other safer alternatives. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a SQL command without sufficient validation to handle SQL syntax or meta characters.

Code Sample:

                  use DBI;
