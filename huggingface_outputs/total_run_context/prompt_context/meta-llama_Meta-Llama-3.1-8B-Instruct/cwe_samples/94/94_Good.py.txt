 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-94 because it directly incorporates user input into the code without proper sanitization. The input is split by spaces and then each number is converted to an integer. However, if the user enters a non-numeric value, it will cause a ValueError, but if they enter a malicious input that can modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment, it can lead to unexpected behavior or even code injection attacks. To mitigate this, the code should validate and sanitize the input before processing it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to ensure it only contains numeric values.
2. Use a safe method to convert the input to integers, such as using a try-except block to catch any potential errors.
3. Consider using a library like `ast` to parse the input and ensure it conforms to the expected syntax. 
4. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters or patterns in the input. 
5. Consider using a more robust input validation library like `voluptuous` or `marshmallow`. 
6. Always handle potential errors and exceptions to prevent unexpected behavior. 
7. Consider using a secure coding practice
