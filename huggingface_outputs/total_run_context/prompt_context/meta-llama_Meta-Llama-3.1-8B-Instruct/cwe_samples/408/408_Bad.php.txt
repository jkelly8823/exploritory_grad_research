 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-408 because it allows an entity to read a file before authentication or authorization has taken place. The function `isOwnerOf($username,$filename)` is called after the file has been read, but it is not clear if this function checks for authentication or authorization before allowing access to the file. If an attacker can provide a valid $username, they can read any file on the system, regardless of their actual permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the call to `isOwnerOf($username,$filename)` before reading the file, to ensure that the file is only read if the user is authorized to do so.
2. Consider using a more secure method of authentication and authorization, such as using a database to store user permissions and checking against that before allowing access to files. 
3. Use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur when reading the file, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.  ```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
                        
                           //check if user is authorized to view file
                           if (isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
                               //read file into string
                               $
