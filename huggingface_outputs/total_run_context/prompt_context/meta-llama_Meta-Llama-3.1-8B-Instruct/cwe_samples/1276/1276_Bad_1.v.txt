 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1276 because the.irq_i() and.time_irq_i() signals are not properly connected to the parent system design. This can cause security risks due to the incorrect connection of signals between the hardware IP and the parent system design.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the parent system design to ensure that the.irq_i() and.time_irq_i() signals are properly connected.
2. Verify that the.irq_i() and.time_irq_i() signals are correctly routed to the intended destinations in the parent system design.
3. Consider using a signal integrity analysis tool to ensure that the signals are properly connected and routed. 4. Update the code to reflect the correct connections and routing of the.irq_i() and.time_irq_i() signals. 5. Perform a thorough review of the code to ensure that all signals are properly connected and routed. 6. Consider using a formal verification tool to ensure that the code meets the required security standards. 7. Update the documentation to reflect the correct connections and routing of the.irq_i() and.time_irq_i() signals. 8. Perform a thorough
