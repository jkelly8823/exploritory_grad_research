 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1276 because the data_in_security_level signal is incorrectly connected to a constant value of 0, which means all data is being treated as secure. This is a security risk because it allows non-secure data to be processed as secure data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Correct the connection of the data_in_security_level signal to the correct value, which should be 1'b1 to indicate non-secure data.
2. Review the code to ensure that all signals are correctly connected and that there are no other copy-and-paste errors or typos that could lead to similar security risks. 3. Consider using a more robust method to handle security levels, such as using a separate module or a more complex logic to determine the security level based on the input data. 4. Use a linter or a static analysis tool to catch similar issues in the future. 5. Consider using a secure coding standard or a set of best practices for secure coding in hardware design. 6. Review the code to ensure that it meets the security requirements of the system and that it is
