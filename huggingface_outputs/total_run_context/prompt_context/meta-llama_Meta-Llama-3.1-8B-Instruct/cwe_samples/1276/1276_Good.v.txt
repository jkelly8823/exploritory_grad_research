 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to CWE-1276. The issue lies in the instantiation of the IP in the parent system, where the data_in_security_level port is connected to the rdata_security_level signal. This is incorrect as the data_in_security_level port should be connected to a secure signal, not the rdata_security_level signal. The rdata_security_level signal is not a secure signal, and connecting it to the data_in_security_level port can lead to security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Identify the correct secure signal to connect to the data_in_security_level port.
2. Update the code to connect the correct secure signal to the data_in_security_level port.
3. Verify that the secure signal is properly validated and sanitized before being connected to the data_in_security_level port.
