 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is storing authentication credentials (username and password) in a properties file, which is not a secure method. This is because the file can be accessed by unauthorized users, potentially leading to credential exposure. The use of a properties file for storing sensitive information is a common vulnerability, as it can be easily accessed and modified by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store authentication credentials securely using a secrets manager or an environment variable.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code or configuration files.
3. Consider using a more secure method for storing and retrieving authentication credentials, such as a database or a secure key-value store.
