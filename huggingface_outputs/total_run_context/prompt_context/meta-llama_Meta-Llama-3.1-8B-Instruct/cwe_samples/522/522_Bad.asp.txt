 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-522 because it stores the database password in plain text within the connection string. This makes it susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information like database passwords.
2. Consider using a secure connection string builder to encrypt the password.
3. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 522 CWE-522: Insecure Storage of Authentication Credentials.  The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.  The password is stored in plain text within the connection string.  This makes it susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.  Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information like database passwords.  Consider using a secure connection string builder to encrypt the password.  Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code.  This is a security risk and should be addressed.  The password should be stored securely.  This can be achieved by using a secure connection string builder or environment variables.  The password should
