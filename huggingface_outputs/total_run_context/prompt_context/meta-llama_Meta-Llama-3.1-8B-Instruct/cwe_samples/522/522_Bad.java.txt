 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-522 because it stores and transmits the password in plain text. The password is retrieved from a properties file and then used directly in the database connection. This makes it susceptible to unauthorized interception and retrieval. An attacker can easily access the password file and use it to gain unauthorized access to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive information like passwords.
2. Use a secure method to transmit the password, such as encryption.
3. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.
4. Consider using a connection pool to manage database connections and reduce the risk of password exposure. 
5. Regularly review and update the password storage and transmission methods to ensure they are secure.  ```python
import os
import getpass

# Get the password from the user
password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")

# Store the password securely
os.environ['PASSWORD'] = password

# Use the stored password to connect to the database
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users
