 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-522 because it stores the compressed password in a variable named "compressed_password". This variable is likely to be stored in memory, which can be accessed by an attacker using techniques such as memory dumping or debugging. Additionally, the code uses the `strcmp` function to compare the compressed password with the input password, which can be vulnerable to timing attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to store and compare passwords, such as using a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2 to store the password.
2. Use a secure method to compare passwords, such as using a constant-time comparison function.
3. Avoid storing sensitive data like passwords in memory for an extended period. Consider using a secure storage mechanism like a secure token or a hardware security module. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

int main() {
    int x;
    printf("%d\n",
