 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-522 because it stores and transmits authentication credentials insecurely. The credentials are passed through the URL as GET parameters, which can be intercepted by an attacker. This allows an attacker to obtain the user's password and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and transmit authentication credentials, such as HTTPS or a secure token-based system.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID. 
4. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
5. Use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2. 
6. Implement a secure password reset mechanism. 
7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 
8. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks. 
9. Use a secure random number generator to generate session IDs and other security-related tokens. 
10. Implement a secure logout mechanism to prevent session fixation attacks. 
11. Use a secure
