 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval of authentication credentials because it stores and transmits the password in plain text. This is a security risk as an attacker can intercept the password and gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and transmit the password, such as encryption or secure tokenization.
2. Consider using a secure authentication protocol, such as Kerberos or NTLM, to authenticate the user.
3. Avoid storing sensitive information, such as passwords, in plain text. Instead, store a hashed or encrypted version of the password.
