 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-642 because it reads a file from a user-provided path and stores the contents in a variable that is then printed to the console. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious data into the file, which could be executed by the application. The file path is obtained from a configuration property, which may be set by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the file path to ensure it is within a trusted directory.
2. Use a secure method to read the file, such as using a `FileInputStream` with a `File` object instead of a string path.
3. Consider using a more secure way to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as using an encrypted file or a secure database. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product stores sensitive data in a file that is not properly protected.

Code Sample:

                  String filePath = "C:/Users/user/Desktop/file.txt";
                  File file = new File(filePath);
                  file.setReadable(true);
                  file.setWritable(true);
                  file.setExecutable(true);
                  file.setReadOnly(false);
                  file.setWritable(false
