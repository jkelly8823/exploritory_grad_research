 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `request.getParameter("reportName")` can be manipulated to access arbitrary files on the server. This is because the `File` constructor does not perform any validation on the input. An attacker can provide a specially crafted `reportName` parameter to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a validated and sanitized input for the `reportName` parameter.
2. Use a `Path` object instead of a `File` object to avoid path traversal attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure way to store and delete files, such as using a database or a secure file system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product stores sensitive information in a file that is not properly protected.

Code Sample:

                  String filePath = "/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + reportName + ".txt";File file = new File(filePath);FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);writer.write(reportName);writer.close();
