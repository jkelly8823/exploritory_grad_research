 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-642 because it stores sensitive information about the user's authentication status in a cookie, which can be accessed by unauthorized actors. This is a security risk because an attacker could potentially modify the cookie to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and verify the user's authentication status, such as a session-based approach or a secure token-based approach.
2. Avoid storing sensitive information in cookies, and instead use a secure storage mechanism such as a database or a secure token storage.
3. Implement proper cookie security measures, such as using the HttpOnly flag and a secure protocol (HTTPS) to prevent cookie tampering and eavesdropping.
