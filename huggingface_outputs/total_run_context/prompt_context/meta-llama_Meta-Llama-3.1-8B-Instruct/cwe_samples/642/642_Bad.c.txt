 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-642 because it stores sensitive information (the path to the restricted directory) in a format string, which is then used to construct a command that is executed with elevated privileges. An attacker could potentially manipulate the format string to inject malicious commands, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to construct the command, such as using a library function that takes a string as input and constructs the command safely.
2. Avoid storing sensitive information in format strings or other user-controllable input.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure that only expected and safe commands are executed. 
4. Use a secure method to raise and drop privileges, such as using a library function that handles privilege escalation and de-escalation securely. 
5. Consider using a secure coding library or framework that provides built-in protection against format string vulnerabilities. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with best practices. 7. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation. 8. Implement a secure
