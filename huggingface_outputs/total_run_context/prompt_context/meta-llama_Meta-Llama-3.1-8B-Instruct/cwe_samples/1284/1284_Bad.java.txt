 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1284 because it does not validate the quantity attribute received from the currentUser object. This attribute is expected to specify a quantity, but it does not check if the value is a positive integer. If an attacker can manipulate the quantity attribute, they can potentially cause the total to be calculated incorrectly, leading to financial loss or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the quantity attribute to ensure it is a positive integer.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the calculation.
3. Use a secure method to retrieve the quantity attribute, such as using a secure random number generator.
