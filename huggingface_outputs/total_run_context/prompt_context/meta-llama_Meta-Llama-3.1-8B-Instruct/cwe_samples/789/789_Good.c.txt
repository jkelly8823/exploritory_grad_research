 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value (jnklen) without ensuring that the size is within expected limits. This can lead to arbitrary amounts of memory being allocated, potentially causing a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input size (jnklen) to ensure it is within expected limits before allocating memory.
2. Consider using a safer memory allocation function that can handle large size values, such as malloc() with a size check.
3. Avoid using sizeof() to calculate the size of a string, as it can lead to incorrect results when the string is not null-terminated. Instead, use strlen() to get the length of the string.
