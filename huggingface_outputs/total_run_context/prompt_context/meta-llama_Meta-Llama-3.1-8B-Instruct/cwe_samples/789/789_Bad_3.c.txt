 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the assumption that all strings have a preamble with a space at the end. However, the code does not account for strings without a space at the end, leading to a negative value for pre_len - msg_len, which can cause the stack to overflow when allocating memory for buf.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the assumption that all strings have a preamble with a space at the end.
2. Use a more robust method to calculate the length of the preamble, such as using strlen() to get the length of the string up to the colon.
3. Use a safer method to allocate memory, such as using malloc() and checking the return value to ensure that the allocation was successful. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate the length of a string before copying it to a fixed-size buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

void copy_string(char *src, char *dest, int dest_len)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < dest_len; i++)
    {
