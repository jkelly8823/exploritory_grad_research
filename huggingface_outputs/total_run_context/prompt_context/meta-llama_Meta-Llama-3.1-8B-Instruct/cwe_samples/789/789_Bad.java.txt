 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory allocation error due to the use of an untrusted size value. The GetUntrustedInt() function returns an integer that is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to potentially allocate an arbitrary amount of memory. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or even a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size value returned by GetUntrustedInt() to ensure it is within expected limits.
2. Use a secure method to allocate memory, such as using a fixed-size buffer or a memory pool.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure memory allocation and deallocation functions. 4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 5. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 6. Implement input validation and sanitization for all user input, including the size value. 7. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a secure hash function to validate the size value. 8. Consider using a memory-safe language, such as Rust or Swift, to develop the application.
