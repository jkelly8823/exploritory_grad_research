 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-789 vulnerability because it allocates memory based on an untrusted input value ($num) without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to potentially allocate an arbitrary amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input value ($num) to ensure it is within a safe range before using it to allocate memory.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash or a balanced binary search tree, to store the messages, which would eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation based on the input value. 
3. If dynamic memory allocation is necessary, use a library that provides bounds checking and other safety features, such as the "Safe" module in Perl. 4. Consider using a more secure way to store the messages, such as using a database or a file-based storage system. 5. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 6. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure
