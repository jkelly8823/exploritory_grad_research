 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the gets() function, which does not perform any bounds checking on the input. This allows an attacker to enter a string longer than the buffer size, causing the program to write beyond the bounds of the buffer and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gets() function with fgets() to limit the input to the size of the buffer.
2. Use a safer function like scanf() with a format string that specifies the maximum number of characters to read.
3. Consider using a more secure input function like getline() or a library like libssh2 that provides secure input functions. 
4. Always check the return value of the input function to ensure that the input was successfully read. 
5. Consider using a memory protection mechanism like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to make it more difficult for attackers to predict the location of the buffer overflow. 6. Consider using a secure coding practice like input validation to ensure that the input is within the expected range. 7. Consider using a library like Valgrind to detect memory errors. 8.
