 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of the strcpy function, which does not perform bounds checking. The hostname variable is being copied from the clienthp->h_name field, which may contain a string longer than the MAX_LEN buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the strncpy function instead of strcpy to prevent buffer overflows. The strncpy function allows for bounds checking and can prevent the buffer from being overflowed. For example, the following code can be used to prevent the buffer overflow: strncpy(hostname, clienthp->h_name, MAX_LEN);hostname[MAX_LEN] = '\0';. This will ensure that the hostname variable is not overflowed and will prevent potential security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a fixed-size buffer to store data from an input source, but does not check whether the amount of data received is less than the size of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

                 ...
                        struct hostent *clienthp;char hostname[MAX_LEN
