 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of scanf() function without specifying the maximum number of characters to read. This allows an attacker to input a string longer than the buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use fgets() function instead of scanf() to read input from the user, as fgets() allows for the specification of the maximum number of characters to read.
2. Always check the return value of scanf() to ensure that the input was successfully read.
3. Consider using a safer function like gets_s() (if available) or a more modern input function like getline() to read input from the user. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a fixed-size buffer to store a string that is input by the user, but does not check the length of the string before copying it into the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

                  char last_name[20];printf ("Enter your last name: ");scanf ("%s", last_name);
