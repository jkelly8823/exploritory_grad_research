 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the strcpy function, which does not perform bounds checking. The size of the input buffer (string) is not verified before copying it to the output buffer (buf), which has a fixed size of 24 characters. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than 24 characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the strncpy function instead of strcpy to prevent buffer overflows. The strncpy function allows for specifying the maximum number of characters to be copied, preventing the buffer from overflowing. For example: strncpy(buf, string, sizeof(buf));. Additionally, consider using a safer function like strlcpy or a secure string library to further mitigate the risk of buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate the length of user-supplied input before using it, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

                  void process_input(char * input){char buffer[10];strcpy(buffer, input);...}
