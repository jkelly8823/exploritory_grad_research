VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes the $debugEnabled variable using user input from the $_POST array. This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate the value of $debugEnabled, which is then used to control the behavior of the login function. The login function, when debug mode is enabled, discloses sensitive information (phpinfo()) and grants administrative access ($isAdmin = True; return True;).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user input before using it to initialize critical variables.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve configuration settings, such as using a configuration file or a secure storage mechanism.
3. Implement proper access control and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. 
4. Remove or restrict the phpinfo() function call, as it discloses sensitive information about the server and its configuration. 
5. Consider using a more secure approach to debug mode, such as using environment variables or a secure configuration file. 6. Review and update the login function to ensure it adheres to secure coding practices. 7. Consider implementing a secure way to handle the $isAdmin variable, such as using a secure authentication mechanism. 8. Use a secure method
