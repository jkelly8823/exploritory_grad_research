EXPLANATION:
The code does not close the BufferReader object after its effective lifetime has ended. This can lead to resource leaks and other issues. The BufferReader object is not explicitly closed, and the FileReader object is not closed either. This is a classic example of a resource leak, which can cause problems if the file is large or if the process runs for an extended period.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the BufferReader object after its effective lifetime has ended. This can be done by calling the Close() method on the BufferReader object. Additionally, close the FileReader object after its effective lifetime has ended. This can be done by calling the Close() method on the FileReader object. Here is the corrected code:

private void processFile(string fName){BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));try{String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine())!= null){processLine(line);}}finally{fil.Close();}fil.Close();} 

Note: The corrected code uses a try-finally block to ensure that the BufferReader object is closed, even if an exception is thrown. The FileReader object is also closed after its effective lifetime has ended.
