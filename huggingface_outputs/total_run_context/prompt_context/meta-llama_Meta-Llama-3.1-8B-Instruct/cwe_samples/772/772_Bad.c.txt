 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not exhibit the vulnerability described by CWE-772. The resource (FILE pointer) is properly closed with the fclose() function after it is no longer needed. This ensures that the resource is released back to the system, preventing potential resource leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is already secure against this type of vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int decodeFile(char* fName) {
                        char buf[BUF_SZ];FILE* f = fopen(fName, "r");if (!f) {printf("cannot open %s\n", fName);return DECODE_FAIL;}else {
                              while (fgets(buf, BUF_SZ, f)) {if (!checkChecksum(buf)) {return DECODE_FAIL;}else {decodeBlock(buf);}}
                           }fclose(f);return DECODE_SUCCESS;
                     }
