 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak because the SqlConnection object is not properly closed. The Close() method is called on the Connection property of the SqlConnection object, but this is not sufficient to close the connection. The correct way to close the connection is to call the Dispose() method on the SqlConnection object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the SqlConnection object by calling the Dispose() method on it, like this: conn.Dispose(); or use a using statement to ensure the connection is properly closed. For example: using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString)) {... }
