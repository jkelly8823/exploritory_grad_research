 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code does not close the database connection after it is used. This can lead to resource leaks and other issues. The connection is created in a try block but it is not closed in a finally block. This means that if an exception is thrown, the connection will not be closed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the database connection in a finally block to ensure it is released after use. This can be done by adding a finally block to the try-catch statement and calling con.close() in it. Here is an example of how to do this: 
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}finally {con.close();}
