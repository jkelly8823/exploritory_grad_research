 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak because the SqlConnection object is not properly closed. The Close() method is called on the Connection property of the SqlConnection object, but this is not the correct way to close the connection. The correct way is to call the Dispose() method on the SqlConnection object. This is because the Connection property is a read-only property that returns the connection object, and calling Close() on it does not close the connection. Additionally, the using statement should be used to ensure that the connection is properly disposed of, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the using statement to ensure that the connection is properly disposed of. The corrected code should look like this: using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString)) { // code here } This will ensure that the connection is properly closed and disposed of, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. Alternatively, you can call the Dispose() method on the SqlConnection object, but using the using statement is a more idiomatic and efficient way to do it.
