 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the use of the `replaceAll()` method with a regular expression that only replaces the literal string "script" and not any other script tags. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious script code. The `mask` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to sanitize user input, such as using a library like OWASP ESAPI or a modern Java library like Apache Commons Text.
2. Use a more comprehensive regular expression that matches all possible script tags, not just the literal string "script".
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, safe characters in the input. 
4. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user-controlled input for security-sensitive operations.

Code Sample:
