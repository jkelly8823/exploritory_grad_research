 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a wrap-around error when incrementing the value of num_imgs. If num_imgs is the maximum value for its type (e.g., int), incrementing it past this value will cause it to wrap around to a very small, negative, or undefined value. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation and potential crashes or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a larger data type, such as size_t, to store the number of images, which can handle larger values without wrapping around. Alternatively, use a library function that can handle large values, such as malloc() with a size parameter. Additionally, consider using a more robust memory allocation function, such as realloc() or memalign(), to ensure proper memory management.
