 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-201 because it is attempting to connect to a MySQL database using the root user with a hardcoded password. This is a sensitive piece of information that should not be accessible to unauthorized actors. The error message indicates that the password is incorrect, but the presence of the password in the code is the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information like database passwords.
2. Consider using a more secure authentication method, such as SSL/TLS, to encrypt the password.
3. Regularly review and update the database credentials to ensure they are secure and not hardcoded in the code. 4. Consider using a database abstraction layer to decouple the application from the database and make it easier to switch to a different database system. 5. Use a secure password hashing library to store passwords securely. 6. Consider using a secrets management tool to securely store and manage sensitive information like database credentials. 7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is following best practices for secure coding. 8. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
