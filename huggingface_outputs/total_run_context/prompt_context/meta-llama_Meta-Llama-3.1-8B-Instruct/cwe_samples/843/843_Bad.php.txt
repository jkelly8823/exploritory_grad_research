 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-843 because it uses the value from the GET request directly without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input and potentially cause a type mismatch error when trying to access the resource.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input from the GET request using a function like filter_var or a library like OWASP ESAPI.
2. Use a type-safe approach to handle the input, such as using a specific data type or a library that can handle the input correctly.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice like input validation and sanitization to prevent type mismatch errors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input without proper validation as part of its input validation routine.

Code Sample:

                  $value = $_GET['value'];$sum = $value + 5;echo "value parameter is '$value'<p>";echo "SUM is $sum";
