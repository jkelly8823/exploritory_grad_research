VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 12, 14, 16, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-843 because it initially allocates a resource (buf.name) as a pointer to a character array, but later accesses it as an integer (buf.nameID). This can lead to undefined behavior, such as incorrect results or crashes, if the code attempts to access the resource using the wrong type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the type of the resource is consistent throughout its lifetime. In this case, buf.name should be consistently treated as a pointer to a character array.
2. Use a type-safe union to ensure that the correct type is accessed based on the value of buf.msgType. For example, use a union with a pointer to a character array and an integer, and access the correct member based on the value of buf.msgType. 
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a struct with separate fields for the message type and the message data, to avoid type-related issues. 
4. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent unexpected values from causing issues. In this case, the value of defaultMessage + 1 could be any
