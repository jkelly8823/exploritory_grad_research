 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-267 privilege escalation vulnerability. This is because the `printDebugInfo` method allows a user with the `GUEST` role to access the `currentDebugState` method, which may contain sensitive information. This is a problem because the `GUEST` role is not intended to have access to this information, and a malicious user could potentially exploit this to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Restrict access to the `currentDebugState` method to only authorized roles, such as `ADMIN` or `USER`.
2. Consider implementing a more robust access control mechanism, such as a role-based access control system, to ensure that users are only granted access to resources and information that they are authorized to access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code of the program does nothing and can be removed.

                  public void doNothing(){
                     // do nothing
                  }
