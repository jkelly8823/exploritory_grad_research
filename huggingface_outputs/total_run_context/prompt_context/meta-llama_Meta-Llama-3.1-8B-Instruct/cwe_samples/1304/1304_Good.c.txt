 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a power save/restore attack. The integrity of the configuration state is not maintained and/or verified between the beginning and ending of the power save operation. In the save_config_state function, the hash of the configuration state is saved to a trusted location, but the configuration state itself is not saved. In the restore_config_state function, the hash of the configuration state is restored from a trusted location, but the configuration state is loaded from a file, which may have been tampered with. This allows an attacker to modify the configuration state during the power save operation and restore a different configuration state during the power restore operation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Save the configuration state itself to a trusted location during the power save operation.
2. Load the configuration state from the trusted location during the power restore operation.
3. Verify the integrity of the configuration state during the power restore operation by comparing the hash of the loaded configuration state with the hash saved during the power save operation. If the hashes do not match, assert an error and halt the system.
