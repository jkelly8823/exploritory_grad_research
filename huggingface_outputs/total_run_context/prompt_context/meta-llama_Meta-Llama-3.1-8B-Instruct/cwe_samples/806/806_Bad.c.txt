 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it uses the size of the source buffer when copying to the destination buffer. This can cause the program to access memory outside of the bounds of the destination buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the size of the destination buffer when copying to it, not the source buffer. The corrected code should be: char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest)-1);... 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable-length string as input to a function that expects a fixed-length string, which may cause the function to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the string.

Code Sample:

                 ...char source[21] = "the character string";char dest[12];strcpy(dest, source);...
               
               

This concludes your task. Provide your response here: 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it uses the strcpy function, which does not check the length of the source string
