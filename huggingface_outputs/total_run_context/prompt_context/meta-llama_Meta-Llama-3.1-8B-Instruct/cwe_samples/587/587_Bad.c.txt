 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-587: Pointer to a Specific Address. The variable pt2Function is set to a specific address (0x08040000) which is not NULL or 0. This allows an attacker to inject code to execute by modifying the address stored in pt2Function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize pt2Function to NULL instead of a specific address.
2. Use a secure method to initialize pt2Function, such as using a function pointer or a safe function pointer initialization method.
3. Validate the address stored in pt2Function before executing the function pointed to by it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
