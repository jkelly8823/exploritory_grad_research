 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds. The Random class in Java uses the system time as a seed, which is not suitable for generating random numbers for security purposes. This is because the system time can be easily predicted, allowing an attacker to reproduce the sequence of random numbers. In a real-world application, it is recommended to use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) like SecureRandom.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a CSPRNG like SecureRandom to generate random numbers. For example, you can use the following code: SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom(); int accountID = random.nextInt();. This will ensure that the random numbers generated are unpredictable and secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product generates a random number but does not check if the generated number is within a valid range.

Code Sample:

                  Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());int accountID = random.nextInt(1000000);int accountNumber = random.nextInt(1000000);if (accountID == accountNumber) {
