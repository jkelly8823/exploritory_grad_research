 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `os.urandom(2)` function to get 2 bytes of randomness for seeding the PRNG. However, the `random.seed()` function requires a seed of at least 15 bytes to be considered cryptographically secure. Using a 2-byte seed is not sufficient for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. This can lead to predictable and insecure random number generation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to generate a seed, such as `secrets.token_bytes(15)` or `os.urandom(15)`, to ensure a minimum of 15 bytes of randomness.
2. Consider using a cryptographically secure PRNG, such as `secrets.randbelow()` or `secrets.token_urlsafe()`, which are designed to generate cryptographically secure random numbers.
