 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-250 because it raises privileges to create a new user directory, which is not necessary. The function `raisePrivileges()` is used to elevate the privileges of the current process, but it is not necessary to do so in this case. The `os.mkdir()` function can be used with the current privileges to create the directory. This creates a new weakness because it allows the process to perform an operation at a higher privilege level than necessary.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `raisePrivileges()` function call and use the `os.mkdir()` function with the current privileges.
2. Consider using a try-except block to handle the `OSError` exception in a more robust way. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 22
CWE Description:
The product performs an operation that involves a string or data structure that is not properly validated or normalized, leading to unexpected behavior.

Code Sample:

                  def makeNewUserDir(username):
                        if invalidUsername(username):
                              
                                 
                                 #avoid CWE-22 and CWE-78
                                 print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')return False
