 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-250 because it is performing an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required. In this case, the code is using the getLastLocation() method, which likely requires location permissions, but it is not checking if the permissions are granted before calling the method. This could potentially lead to a SecurityException being thrown if the permissions are not granted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the location permissions are granted before calling the getLastLocation() method.
2. Handle the SecurityException that may be thrown if the permissions are not granted.
