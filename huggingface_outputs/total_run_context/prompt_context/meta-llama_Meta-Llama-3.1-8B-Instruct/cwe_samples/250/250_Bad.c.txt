 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-250 because it performs an operation at a higher privilege level than necessary. The chroot() function is used to change the root directory to APP_HOME, which is likely a directory that the application has write access to. However, the chdir() function is then used to change the current working directory to the root directory, which is a directory that the application does not have write access to. This creates a new weakness because the application is now operating at a higher privilege level than necessary, which could potentially allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the chroot() function call, as it is not necessary for the application to operate at a higher privilege level.
2. Use the chdir() function to change the current working directory to a directory that the application has write access to, rather than the root directory. This will prevent the application from operating at a higher privilege level than necessary. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to change the current working directory, such as using the realpath() function to ensure that the directory path is absolute and does not contain any symbolic links.
