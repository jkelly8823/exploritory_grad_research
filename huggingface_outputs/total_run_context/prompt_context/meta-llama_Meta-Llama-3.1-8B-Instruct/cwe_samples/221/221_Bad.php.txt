 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code does not record security-relevant information when a user fails to log in, but instead increments the login attempts counter. This could lead to an incorrect decision or hamper later analysis. The writeLog function is only called when the user has exceeded the maximum number of login attempts, which may not be the case when the user fails to log in due to incorrect credentials.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the writeLog function call to the else branch of the if statement to ensure that a log entry is created for each failed login attempt.
2. Consider implementing a more robust logging mechanism that captures additional information such as the IP address of the user attempting to log in.
