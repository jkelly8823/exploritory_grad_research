 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-224 because it records security-relevant information according to the symbolic link name instead of the canonical name. This can lead to incorrect logging and potential security issues. The code resolves the symbolic link but then uses the resolved path to check file ownership, which is correct. However, when logging the attempted access, it uses the symbolic link name instead of the canonical name. This can cause issues if the symbolic link is deleted or renamed, as the log entry will reference a non-existent file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the logging statement to use the canonical name of the file instead of the symbolic link name. This can be done by using the $realFile variable consistently throughout the code.
2. Consider using a more robust logging mechanism that can handle symbolic links and other potential issues. 
3. Review the code to ensure that it handles other potential edge cases, such as deleted or renamed files.
