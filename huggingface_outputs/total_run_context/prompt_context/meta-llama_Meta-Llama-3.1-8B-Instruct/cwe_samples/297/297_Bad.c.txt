 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack because it does not properly verify the certificate's association with the host. Although the code checks if the certificate is valid (SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)==X509_V_OK), it does not check if the certificate is issued for the correct host. This allows an attacker to intercept the communication and present a fake certificate that is valid but not associated with the intended host.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a proper certificate verification process that checks the certificate's subject and issuer to ensure they match the expected host.
2. Use a trusted certificate authority (CA) to verify the certificate's authenticity.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or 1.3, which provides additional security features and better protection against MITM attacks.
