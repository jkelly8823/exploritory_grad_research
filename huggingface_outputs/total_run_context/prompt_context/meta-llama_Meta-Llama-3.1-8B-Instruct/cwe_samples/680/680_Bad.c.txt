 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the line where the memory is allocated. The variable num_imgs is calculated by the function get_num_imgs(), which may return a value larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer. When this value is used to calculate the memory allocation, it may cause an integer overflow, resulting in less memory being allocated than expected. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the allocated memory is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a larger data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the number of images. Alternatively, the code can use a safe allocation function that checks for integer overflows, such as malloc_usable_size(). Additionally, the code can add bounds checking to ensure that the allocated memory is not accessed beyond its bounds. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check if the memory allocation was successful before using the allocated memory, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the allocation fails.

Code Sample:

                  int* ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));if (ptr
