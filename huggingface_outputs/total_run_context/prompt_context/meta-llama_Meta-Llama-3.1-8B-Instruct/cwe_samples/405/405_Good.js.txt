 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression pattern used in this code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CWE-405 "Resource Exhaustion" vulnerability. The pattern is designed to match a specific sequence of characters, and it does not seem to be susceptible to an adversary causing excessive resource consumption. However, it's worth noting that the pattern is quite complex and may have unintended consequences if not properly tested.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider simplifying the regular expression pattern to make it easier to understand and test. Additionally, consider adding input validation to ensure that the input string does not contain any malicious characters that could potentially cause resource exhaustion. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user-controlled input for security-relevant characters or bytes before using the input in a security-relevant context.

Code Sample:

               var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
               var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
               var result = test_string.search(good_pattern);
