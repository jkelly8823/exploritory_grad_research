 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The file_get_contents() function can consume excessive resources if the file is large or if the adversary can cause the function to read a large number of files. This can lead to a situation where the adversary can cause the product to consume excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a limit on the size of files that can be read using file_get_contents(). This can be done by checking the file size before reading it.
2. Implement a limit on the number of files that can be read in a certain time period. This can be done by keeping track of the number of files read and checking against a threshold.
3. Consider using a more efficient method of reading files, such as using a streaming approach. This can help reduce the amount of resources consumed by the file_get_contents() function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product does not properly check whether a value is within the expected range before using it, leading to a potential buffer overflow or other type of error.
