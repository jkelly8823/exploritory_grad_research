 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-694 because it uses multiple forms with the same name ("ProjectForm") within the same formset. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues when the forms are submitted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Rename one of the forms to a unique name to avoid conflicts.
2. Consider using a more robust form management system that can handle multiple forms with the same name. 
3. If the forms are intended to be identical, consider using a single form and using JavaScript to dynamically generate the form fields as needed.  ```javascript
// Example of dynamically generating form fields
const formFields = [
  { name: 'field1', type: 'text' },
  { name: 'field2', type: 'text' }
];

// Create the form fields dynamically
const form = document.createElement('form');
form.name = 'ProjectForm';
formFields.forEach((field) => {
  const input = document.createElement('input');
  input.type = field.type;
  input.name = field.name;
  form.appendChild(input);
});
```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```  ```
