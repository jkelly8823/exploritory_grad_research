 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain a public static field that is not marked final. The field 'appPropertiesFile' is marked as 'final', which means its value cannot be changed after it is initialized. This meets the requirement of the CWE description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure in this regard. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for a null pointer exception when dereferencing a pointer.

Code Sample:

                  public class SomeAppClass {
                        
                           public static String getSomeValue() {
                              String someValue = null;
                              return someValue;
                           }
                     }
               
            

This concludes your task. Provide your response here: 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not check for a null pointer exception when dereferencing a pointer. In the 'getSomeValue()' method, the variable'someValue' is initialized to 'null' and then returned without any null check. This can lead to a NullPointerException when the returned value is dereferenced.
