 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a public static field that is not marked final, which might allow it to be modified in unexpected ways. This is a potential security risk as it could lead to unintended behavior or data corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Mark the field as final to prevent it from being modified after initialization. For example: `public static final String appPropertiesFile = "app/Application.properties";` This will ensure that the field's value cannot be changed once it is set.

                              // some code here
                              String username = "admin";
