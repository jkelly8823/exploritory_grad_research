 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a public static field 'appPropertiesConfigFile' which is not marked as final. This makes it possible for the field to be modified unexpectedly, potentially leading to security issues. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Mark the field as final to prevent unexpected modifications. For example: 
```java
public static final String appPropertiesConfigFile = "app/properties.config";
``` 
This ensures that the field's value cannot be changed once it is initialized.
