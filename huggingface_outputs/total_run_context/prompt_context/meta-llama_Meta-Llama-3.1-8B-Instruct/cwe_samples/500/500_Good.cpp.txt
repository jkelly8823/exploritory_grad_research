 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a public static field 'appPropertiesConfigFile' which is not marked as final. This makes it possible for the field to be modified in unexpected ways, potentially leading to security issues. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Mark the field as final to prevent unexpected modifications. For example, change the line to: `public:static final const string appPropertiesConfigFile = "app/properties.config";`
