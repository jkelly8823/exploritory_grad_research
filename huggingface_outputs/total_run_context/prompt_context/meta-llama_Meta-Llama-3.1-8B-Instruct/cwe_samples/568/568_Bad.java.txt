 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The finalize() method is not calling super.finalize() which is a requirement in Java. This can lead to resource leaks and other issues. The finalize() method should always call super.finalize() to ensure proper cleanup.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Call super.finalize() at the end of the finalize() method. The corrected code should look like this: 
protected void finalize() {discardNative(); super.finalize();} 
This will ensure that the finalize() method is properly calling the superclass's finalize() method. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 125

                      int y = x + z;
                      System.out.println(y);
                  }
               
            

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The variable 'z' is not used in the provided code sample. However, it is declared in the same method. This might be a case of a variable being declared but not used, but it is not a vulnerability as
