 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-96 because it directly includes user input from the GET request into the file without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the file, which can be executed when the file is included.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate user input. Only allow specific characters and strings to be included in the file.
2. Use a templating engine or a secure method to include user input in the file, such as using a placeholder and replacing it with the sanitized input.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against code injection attacks. 
4. Always validate and sanitize user input before including it in any executable resource. 
5. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 
7. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities. 
8. Implement a secure coding practice, such as using a secure coding standard or a code review process. 
9. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks
