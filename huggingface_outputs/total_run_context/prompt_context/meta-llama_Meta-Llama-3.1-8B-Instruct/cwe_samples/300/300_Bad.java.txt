 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code does not verify the identity of the remote host before establishing a connection. This makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. The PrintWriter object is created without checking if the socket is connected, which could lead to a NullPointerException if the socket is not connected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the identity of the remote host before establishing a connection. This can be done by checking the remote host's IP address or using a secure authentication mechanism.
2. Check if the socket is connected before creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by calling the isClosed() method on the socket object. If the socket is closed, create a new socket connection before proceeding. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate the format of input received from the user or from a source external to the product, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

                  String input = request.getParameter("input");
                  String output = input.toUpperCase();
                  response.setContentType("text/plain");
                  response.getWriter().println(output);
