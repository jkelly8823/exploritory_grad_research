 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-923 because it allows access from any domain using the wildcard character (*). This can lead to unauthorized access to the application. The second line allows access from any domain, which is a potential security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the wildcard character (*) from the second line to restrict access to only the specified domain.
2. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as IP blocking or SSL/TLS encryption, to further secure the application. 
3. Review the Adobe Policy File schema to ensure that the policy file is correctly configured and up-to-date.
