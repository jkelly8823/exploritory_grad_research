 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a file upload vulnerability. The code allows users to upload files to the server without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or data tampering. The line where the target location is defined is vulnerable because it directly uses the filename from the uploaded file without any checks. This can lead to a situation where a malicious user can upload a file with a malicious extension, which can be executed by the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the file extension before uploading it to the server. This can be done by checking the file extension against a list of allowed extensions.
2. Sanitize the filename to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be done by using the basename function to remove any directory paths from the filename.
3. Use a secure method to upload files, such as using a library like PHP's built-in upload library, which provides additional security features like file validation and sanitization. 
4. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded and executed by the server. 
5. Regularly update and patch the server and its dependencies to prevent exploitation of
