 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-420 because it does not use the same level of protection for an alternate channel. In this case, the alternate channel is the address bus. The code checks if the address is equal to 32'hF00, but it does not check if the incoming ID is in the allowlist before writing to the data_out. This allows an attacker to write to the data_out without being in the allowlist.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the incoming ID is in the allowlist before writing to the data_out.
2. Use the same level of protection for the address bus as the incoming ID. This can be done by checking if the address is in the allowlist before allowing it to access the data_out. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable-length string to store a fixed-length value.

Code Sample:

               module foo_bar(data_out, data_in, incoming_id, address, clk, rst_n);
               output [31:0] data_out;
               input [31:0] data_in, incoming_id,
