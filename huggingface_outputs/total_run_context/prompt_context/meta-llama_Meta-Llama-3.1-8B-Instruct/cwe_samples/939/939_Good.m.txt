 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-939 because it allows any actor to invoke the handler using the custom URL scheme. This is because the `openURL` method is called directly without any authentication or authorization checks. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that invokes the handler with unintended consequences.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication and authorization checks before invoking the handler using the custom URL scheme.
2. Use a secure method to handle the custom URL scheme, such as using a URL handler that is only accessible to trusted actors.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the URL, such as using a URL scheme that is not easily guessable or modifiable. 
4. Validate and sanitize any user-input data before passing it to the handler. 
5. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure handling of custom URL schemes.  ```bash
// Example of secure handling of custom URL scheme
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    // Check if the URL is from a trusted source
    if ([sourceApplication
