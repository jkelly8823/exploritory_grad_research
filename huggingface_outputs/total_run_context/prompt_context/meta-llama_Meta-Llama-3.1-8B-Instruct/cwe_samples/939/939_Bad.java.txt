 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-939 because it allows any actor to invoke the handler using the custom URL scheme. The condition `url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")` checks if the URL starts with "examplescheme:", but it does not check if the actor is authorized to invoke the handler. This allows an attacker to invoke the handler by crafting a URL that starts with "examplescheme:".
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the actor is authorized to invoke the handler. You can do this by checking the user's credentials or session information before allowing the handler to be invoked. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure method to handle custom URL schemes, such as using a whitelist of allowed schemes and handlers.
