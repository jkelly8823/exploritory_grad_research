EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a custom URL scheme handler being invoked by an attacker. This is because the code does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme. The `shouldStartLoadWithRequest` method is called when the user clicks on a link in the web view, and the code checks if the URL scheme is "exampleScheme". If it is, the code then checks if the resource specifier has a prefix of "specialFunction". If it does, the code makes data available back in the web view. However, an attacker could potentially craft a URL that invokes the handler, allowing them to access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the URL scheme and resource specifier to ensure they are coming from a trusted source.
2. Use a more secure method to make data available back in the web view, such as using a secure protocol like HTTPS.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle custom URL schemes, such as using a URL handler that is only accessible from within the app.
