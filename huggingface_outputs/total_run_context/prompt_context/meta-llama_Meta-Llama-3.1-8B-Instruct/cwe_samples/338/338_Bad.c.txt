 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the rand() function, which is not cryptographically strong. This is a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) and is not suitable for generating random numbers in a security context. The srand() function is used to seed the PRNG, but it uses the current time, which is not a suitable seed for a cryptographically strong PRNG. This makes the code vulnerable to predictable random number generation, which can be exploited by attackers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a cryptographically strong PRNG, such as the <openssl/rand.h> library or the <random> library in C++. Replace the rand() function with a function that generates cryptographically strong random numbers. For example, you can use the rand_r() function from the <stdlib.h> library, which is designed to be cryptographically strong. Alternatively, you can use the random_device class from the <random> library, which generates truly random numbers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable-length string without bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

                  char buffer[10];
