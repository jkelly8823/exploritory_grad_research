 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-431 because it does not handle the case where the IP address is not a valid hostname. If the IP address is not a valid hostname, the getHostName() method will return null, and calling println on a null object will result in a NullPointerException. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the InetAddress.getByName() method returns null, which can happen if the IP address is not a valid IP address.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the InetAddress.getByName() method returns null before calling getHostName() on it.
2. Check if the getHostName() method returns null before calling println on it.
3. Consider using a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown by the InetAddress.getByName() method.
