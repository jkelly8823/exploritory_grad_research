 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double free error. The variable bar is a global array, and the free() function is called on it. However, the memory for bar was not allocated using malloc(), calloc(), or realloc(). This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the free() call, as the memory for bar is not dynamically allocated.
2. If bar needs to be dynamically allocated, use malloc() or a similar function to allocate memory for it.
3. Consider using a smart pointer or a container class to manage the memory for bar, to avoid manual memory management. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int x;
                  if (x > 5) {
                     printf("x is greater than 5\n");
                  }
