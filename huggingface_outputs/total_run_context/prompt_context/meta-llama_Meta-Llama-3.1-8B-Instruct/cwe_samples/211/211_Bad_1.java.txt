 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-211 because it prints the path of the directory where the input file is located. This sensitive system information can be used by an attacker to gather information about the system and potentially exploit it. The error message is not directly generated or controlled by the product, but rather by the programming language interpreter (Java in this case). The error message contains the path of the directory, which is sensitive system information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid printing sensitive system information in error messages. Instead, provide a generic error message that does not reveal any sensitive information.
2. Use a logging framework to log errors and sensitive information, rather than printing it directly to the console.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle file paths, such as using a secure random number generator to generate a unique directory path.
