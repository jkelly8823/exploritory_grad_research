 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1311 because it incorrectly translates security attributes from OCP MReqInfo to AHB HPROT. The translation is done in the always @* block where the case statement is used to map the OCP MReqInfo to AHB HPROT. However, the translation is not accurate as it does not consider the security attributes of the bus controller. The code assumes that the bus controller has a hardware identity of 0, which is not a valid assumption. This can lead to incorrect security attributes being translated, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the bus.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the OCP MReqInfo protocol to ensure that the security attributes are correctly translated.
2. Use a more accurate method to determine the hardware identity of the bus controller, such as using a secure identifier.
3. Update the case statement to accurately translate the security attributes based on the bus controller's hardware identity. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 121
