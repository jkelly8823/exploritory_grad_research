 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hard-coded constant (MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) for the buffer size, which is a security-critical value. This increases the likelihood of mistakes during code maintenance or security policy change. A better approach would be to define a symbolic name for the buffer size, making it easier to modify or update the value without affecting the rest of the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Define a symbolic name for the buffer size using a configuration file or a constant defined in a separate header file.
2. Use the symbolic name instead of the hard-coded constant in the code.
3. Consider using a more secure buffer size, such as a dynamically allocated buffer or a buffer with a size that is a multiple of the maximum size of a character in the input. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a fixed-size buffer to store data from an untrusted source, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Code Sample:

                  char buffer[10];...strcpy(buffer, input_string);
