 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-628 because the `accessGranted` method is called with incorrect arguments. The `accessGranted` method is defined to take a `String[]` as an argument, but it is being called with a `String` argument. This will lead to incorrect behavior and resultant weaknesses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `accessGranted` method call to pass the correct argument type, which is a `String[]`.
2. Consider using a more robust method for checking access, such as using a security framework or library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The product does not properly check whether a value is within a specified range before using that value, leading to a potential out-of-range condition.

Code Sample:

                  public int getAge() {return age;}
                     public void setAge(int age) {
                        if (age >= 0) {
                            this.age = age;
                        }
                     }
