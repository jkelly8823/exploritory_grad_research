EXPLANATION:
The customErrors mode is set to "RemoteOnly", which means that custom error pages will only be displayed for remote clients. However, this does not prevent attackers from mining information from the framework's built-in responses. To prevent this, the customErrors mode should be set to "On" or "RemoteOnly" with a custom error page specified.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the customErrors mode to "On" to display custom error pages for all clients.
2. Set the customErrors mode to "RemoteOnly" and specify a custom error page using the defaultRedirect attribute. For example: <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" defaultRedirect="~/ErrorPage.aspx"/>.
3. Consider implementing a more secure error handling mechanism, such as using a third-party library or a custom error handling module.
