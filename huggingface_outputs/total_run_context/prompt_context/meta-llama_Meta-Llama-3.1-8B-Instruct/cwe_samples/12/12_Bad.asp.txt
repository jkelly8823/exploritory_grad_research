 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The customErrors mode is set to "Off", which means that the application will display detailed error messages to the user. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, making it vulnerable to attacks. To prevent this, the customErrors mode should be set to "On" or "RemoteOnly".
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the customErrors mode to "On" or "RemoteOnly" to prevent the display of detailed error messages.
2. Consider implementing a custom error page to handle errors in a more secure manner.
