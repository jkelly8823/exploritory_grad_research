 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-12, as it does not enable custom error pages. This allows attackers to potentially mine information from the framework's built-in responses. The'mode' attribute is set to 'On', which is correct, but the 'defaultRedirect' attribute is set to a static file path ('YourErrorPage.htm'). This is not a custom error page, and the framework's built-in responses will still be displayed in case of an error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, replace the 'defaultRedirect' attribute with a valid custom error page, such as a.aspx page. For example: '<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="ErrorPage.aspx" />'. This will ensure that custom error pages are displayed in case of an error, preventing attackers from mining information from the framework's built-in responses. Additionally, consider implementing a more secure error handling mechanism, such as using a 404 error page or a custom error handler.
