VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates a buffer of size 3, but then populates it with three integers. This is a buffer overflow because the buffer size is not large enough to hold the three integers. The correct size should be 3 * sizeof(int) to account for the size of each integer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line where the buffer is allocated to id_sequence = (int*) malloc(3 * sizeof(int)); to correctly calculate the size of the buffer.
2. Consider using a safer function like realloc to dynamically allocate memory and avoid buffer overflows. 
3. Always check the return value of malloc to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. 
4. Use a memory debugging tool to detect and prevent memory-related bugs.  ```c
int *id_sequence;
                     
                     /* Allocate space for an array of three ids. */
                     
                     
                     id_sequence = (int*) malloc(3 * sizeof(int));if (id_sequence == NULL) exit(1);
                     
                     /* Populate the id array. */
                     
                     
                     id_sequence[0] = 13579;id_sequence[1] = 24680;id_sequence[
