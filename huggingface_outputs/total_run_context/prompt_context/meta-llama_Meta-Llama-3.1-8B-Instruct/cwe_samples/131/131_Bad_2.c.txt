 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the size of the buffer allocated is not correctly calculated. The size of the buffer is calculated as 4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE, which is a constant value. However, the size of the user-supplied string is not known at compile time and can be much larger than MAX_SIZE. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the user-supplied string is copied into the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Calculate the size of the buffer dynamically based on the size of the user-supplied string.
2. Use a safer function like strcpy_s or strncpy to copy the user-supplied string into the buffer.
3. Consider using a library like libsafe to detect buffer overflows at runtime. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not correctly handle the case where the user-supplied string is NULL, which could lead to a null pointer dereference.

Code Sample:

                  char * copy_input(char *user_supplied_string){
                        int i, dst_index;char *dst_buf = (char*)malloc(4*sizeof(char) * MAX
