 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the size of the buffer is calculated using the variable numWidgets which is obtained from an untrusted source. The variable numWidgets is not checked for overflow before it is used to allocate memory. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of numWidgets is larger than the maximum allowed value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safe function to get the size of the buffer, such as malloc_usable_size() or sizeof() to get the size of the buffer.
2. Check the value of numWidgets for overflow before using it to allocate memory.
3. Use a secure function to allocate memory, such as malloc() with a size that is checked for overflow. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product does not correctly handle the case where a memory allocation fails, which could lead to a denial of service.

Code Sample:

                  int i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;
                     numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {Exit
