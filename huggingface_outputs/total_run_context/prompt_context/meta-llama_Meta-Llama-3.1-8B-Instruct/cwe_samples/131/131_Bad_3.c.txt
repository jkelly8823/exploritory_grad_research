 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to incorrect buffer size calculation. The line `headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader));` allocates memory for the headers array, but the size calculation is incorrect. The `sizeof(PacketHeader)` returns the size of a single `PacketHeader` struct, not the total size of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the `ParsePacketHeaders` function tries to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Correct the buffer size calculation by using `numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader)` instead of `sizeof(PacketHeader)`.
2. Use a safer memory allocation function, such as `calloc`, to ensure that the memory is properly initialized.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array or a linked list, to store the packet headers. This can help prevent buffer overflows and make the code more maintainable.
