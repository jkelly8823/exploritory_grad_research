 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to incorrect calculation of the size to be used when allocating a buffer. The size of the buffer is calculated as sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs, which may not be sufficient to hold the actual data. This is because the size of the buffer is calculated based on the size of the struct img_t, which may not be the actual size of the data that will be stored in the buffer. Additionally, the code does not check if the allocation was successful, which could lead to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Calculate the size of the buffer based on the actual size of the data that will be stored in the buffer, not the size of the struct img_t.
2. Check if the allocation was successful before using the pointer.
3. Consider using a safer allocation function, such as malloc_usable_size, to get the actual size of the allocated memory. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product does not correctly handle the case where the input to a function is a null pointer, which could lead to a null pointer dereference.
