 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential attack where an attacker can modify the location property of the window.opener object, potentially leading to a security breach. This is because the code opens a new window to an untrusted external site without properly preventing the external site from modifying the window.opener object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to prevent the external site from modifying the window.opener object. This can be achieved by setting the window.opener property to null before opening the new window. For example: var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank"); window.opener = null; This will prevent the external site from modifying the window.opener object, thereby mitigating the vulnerability. Alternatively, the code can use a more secure method to open the new window, such as using the window.open() method with the 'noopener' or 'noreferrer' argument, which will prevent the external site from accessing the window.opener object. For example: var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank", "noopener");
