 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1022 because it opens a link to an external site in a new tab without properly preventing the external site from modifying the window.opener object's location property. The rel="noopener noreferrer" attribute is not sufficient to prevent this vulnerability, as it only prevents the external site from accessing the opener window's document and history objects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use the rel="noopener noreferrer" attribute in conjunction with the rel="noreferrer" attribute, which prevents the external site from accessing the opener window's document and history objects. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to open the link, such as using a JavaScript library like jQuery to open the link in a new tab without modifying the window.opener object. For example: 
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('a[target="_blank"]').on('click', function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        window.open($(this).attr('href'), '_blank');
    });
});
```
