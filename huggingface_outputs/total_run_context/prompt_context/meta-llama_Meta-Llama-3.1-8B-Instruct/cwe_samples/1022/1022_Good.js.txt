 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential attack where an attacker can modify the window.opener object's location property, potentially leading to a security breach. This is because the newWindow.opener is set to null, which does not prevent the attacker from modifying the location property of the window.opener object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the newWindow.opener object is properly set to a trusted object, such as the parent window, to prevent the attacker from modifying its properties. You can do this by setting newWindow.opener to the parent window, like this: newWindow.opener = window.parent. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to open the new window, such as using a library like jQuery to open the window with a specific set of properties that cannot be modified by the attacker.
