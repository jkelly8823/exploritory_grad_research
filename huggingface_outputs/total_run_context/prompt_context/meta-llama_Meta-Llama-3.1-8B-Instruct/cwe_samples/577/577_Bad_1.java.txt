 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-577 because it uses sockets in a stateless EJB, which is against the EJB specification. The code creates a ServerSocket and starts a new thread to listen for incoming connections. This is not allowed in a stateless EJB, as it can lead to resource leaks and other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the socket creation and thread management to a separate, stateless session bean.
2. Use a message-driven bean (MDB) to handle incoming messages.
3. Remove the socket creation and thread management from the StockSymbolBean class. Instead, use a separate class or bean to handle the socket communication. This will help to keep the StockSymbolBean class focused on its business logic and avoid any potential issues with resource leaks or other EJB specification violations.
