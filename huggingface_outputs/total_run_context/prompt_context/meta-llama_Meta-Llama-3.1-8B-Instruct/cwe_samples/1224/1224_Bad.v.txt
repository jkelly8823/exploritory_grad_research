 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1224 because the Write_once_status bit can be reprogrammed by software. The line "Write_once_status <= Data_in[0];" allows the user to set the Write_once_status bit by writing a value to the Data_in input. This is a violation of the write-once property of the sticky bits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the line "Write_once_status <= Data_in[0];" to prevent the Write_once_status bit from being reprogrammed by software.
2. Add a check to ensure that the Write_once_status bit is not set when the write signal is asserted. This can be done by adding a condition to the always block to check if the Write_once_status bit is already set before allowing the user to write to the register. For example: "if (~write & ~Write_once_status)".
3. Consider using a more secure method to implement the write-once property, such as using a hardware-based solution or a software-based solution that uses a secure random number generator to generate a unique value for the Write_once_status bit.
