 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 108
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1339 due to the use of floating-point arithmetic operations. The expression `1500.0 / z` and `108.0 - ((815.0 - 1500.0 / z) / y)` may result in loss of precision due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in memory. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when dealing with large or small numbers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a library that provides high-precision arithmetic, such as the `num-traits` crate in Rust. Alternatively, you can use the `f64::consts` module to define constants with high precision. Additionally, you can use the `f64::ulp` function to check for underflow or overflow before performing the division. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The product uses a function that is not thread-safe, which can lead to data corruption or other concurrency-related issues.

Code Sample:

		      fn float_calc(turns: usize) -> f64 
		      {
		      
			let mut x: Vec<f64> =
