 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a loss of precision in the fractional part of the result due to the use of the `BigRational::from_integer` method, which may not preserve the required accuracy and precision in its fractional part. This is because the `BigRational::from_integer` method may truncate the fractional part of the number, leading to an incorrect result.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `BigRational::from_rational` method instead of `BigRational::from_integer` to preserve the fractional part of the number.
2. Consider using a more precise data type, such as `num_rational::BigRational` with a higher precision, to minimize the loss of precision in the fractional part. 
3. Use a library that provides support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as the `num-bigint` crate, to ensure that the calculations are performed with the required accuracy and precision.
