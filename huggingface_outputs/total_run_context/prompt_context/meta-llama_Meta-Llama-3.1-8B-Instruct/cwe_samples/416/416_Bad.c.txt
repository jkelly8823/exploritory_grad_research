 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-416 because it frees the memory pointed to by buf2R1 and then reuses the memory pointed to by buf2R1. The memory is then allocated again and saved in buf2R2. The original pointer buf2R1 is no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer buf2R2.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a different variable to store the result of the malloc call for buf2R2 to avoid reusing the memory pointed to by buf2R1.
2. Use a different variable to store the result of the malloc call for buf3R2 to avoid reusing the memory pointed to by buf2R2.
3. Use a different variable to store the result of the strncpy call to avoid reusing the memory pointed to by buf2R1. 
4. Use a different variable to store the result of the free call for buf1R1 to avoid reusing the memory pointed to by buf1R1. 
5. Use a different variable to store the result of the free call for buf2R2 to avoid re
