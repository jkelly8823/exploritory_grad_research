 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-416 because it frees the memory allocated by malloc and then attempts to use the freed pointer in the logError function. This is a classic example of a dangling pointer vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should not use the freed pointer after it has been freed. Instead, it should be set to NULL or a safe value to prevent any further use. For example, the corrected code could be: char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);if (err) {abrt = 1;free(ptr); ptr = NULL;}...if (abrt) {logError("operation aborted before commit", NULL);}
