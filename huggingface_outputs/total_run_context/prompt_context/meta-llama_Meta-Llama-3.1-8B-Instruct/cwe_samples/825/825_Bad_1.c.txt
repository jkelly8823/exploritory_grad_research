 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-825 because it attempts to free the memory pointed to by the pointer 'ptr' twice. The first free operation is conditional and may not be executed, but the second free operation is unconditional. This can lead to a double-free vulnerability, where the memory is freed twice, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the unconditional free operation to prevent double-free vulnerability.
2. Consider using smart pointers or containers to manage memory and avoid manual memory management.
3. Use a debugger or memory debugger to detect and prevent double-free vulnerabilities.  ```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
//...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
}
// Remove the unconditional free operation
// free(ptr);
```  ```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
//...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
}
// Use smart pointers or containers to manage memory
// std::unique_ptr<char> ptr = std::make_unique<char[]>(SIZE);
//...
// if (abrt) {
//     ptr.reset();
// }
```  ```c
