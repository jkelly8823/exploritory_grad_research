 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-825 because it attempts to log an error message with a pointer that has already been freed. The pointer 'ptr' is freed in the first if statement when 'err' is true, but it is still used in the second if statement when 'abrt' is true. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the free(ptr) statement to after the second if statement to ensure that the pointer is not used after it has been freed.
2. Consider using a smart pointer or a unique pointer to automatically manage the memory and avoid such issues. 
3. Always check the return value of malloc to ensure that the memory allocation was successful before using the pointer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 122
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that has been declared but not initialized.

Code Sample:

                  int x;int y = x + 5;int z = y * 2;int result = z / 2;printf("%d", result);
