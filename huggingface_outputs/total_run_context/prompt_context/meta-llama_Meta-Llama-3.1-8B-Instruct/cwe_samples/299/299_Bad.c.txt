 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a certificate validation issue. The SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns a pointer to the peer's certificate, but it does not check if the certificate has been revoked. This can lead to a situation where a compromised certificate is used, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the peer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use the SSL_get_peer_certificate verify the certificate's revocation status using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder. You can use the OpenSSL library's functions, such as SSL_get_peer_certificate and SSL_get_peer_cert_info, to retrieve the certificate's serial number and then use the CRL or OCSP to check its revocation status. Additionally, you should consider implementing certificate pinning to ensure that only expected certificates are accepted. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:
