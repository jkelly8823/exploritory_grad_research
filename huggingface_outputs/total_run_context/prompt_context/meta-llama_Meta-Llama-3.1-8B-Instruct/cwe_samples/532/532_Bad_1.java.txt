 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-532 because it logs sensitive information to the log file. The line "Log.e("ExampleActivity", "Caught exception: " + e + " While on User:" + User.toString());" logs the exception and the current user, which could potentially expose sensitive user information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid logging sensitive information to the log file. Instead, log only the exception message and the class name.
2. Consider using a more secure logging mechanism, such as a logging framework that supports encryption or secure storage of log files.
3. Remove the User.toString() call, as it may expose sensitive user information. If the user information is necessary for debugging purposes, consider using a secure way to log it, such as using a secure logging framework or encrypting the information before logging it.
