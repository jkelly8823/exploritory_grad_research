 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-532 because it logs sensitive information to the console. The query string is logged in case of an exception, which could potentially expose sensitive user information. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to CWE-89 because it uses string concatenation to build the SQL query, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Log sensitive information securely, such as using a secure logging mechanism or encrypting the log message.
3. Remove the query string from the log message to prevent exposure of sensitive user information.
