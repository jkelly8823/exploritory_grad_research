 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-532 because it logs sensitive information such as usernames and credit card numbers. This information can be valuable to an attacker and potentially expose sensitive user information. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a parameterized logger to avoid concatenating user input with the log message.
2. Use a secure logging mechanism that masks sensitive information such as credit card numbers.
3. Consider using a logging framework that supports encryption and secure storage of logs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
Improper Validation of Array Index.

Code Sample:

                  String[] array = new String[10];
                  array[10] = "Hello";

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-89 because it attempts to access an array index that is out of bounds. The array has a size of 10, but the code attempts to access the 11th index (index 10 is the last valid index). This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes,
