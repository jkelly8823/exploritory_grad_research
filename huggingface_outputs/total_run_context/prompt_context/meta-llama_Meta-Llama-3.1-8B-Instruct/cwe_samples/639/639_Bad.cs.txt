 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-639 because it directly uses the user-provided input (invoiceID.Text) to construct a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query by modifying the invoiceID.Text value, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other users' data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
3. Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract the database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The code does not check for null or empty values before using them, which can lead to a NullReferenceException.

Code Sample:

                 ...
		  string customerName = customerName.Text;
		  if (customerName!= "")
		  {
			  // do something with customerName
		  }
		 ...
