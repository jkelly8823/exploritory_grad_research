 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded password "Mew!" which is a clear violation of the principle of least privilege. This password is used to verify the admin credentials, which makes the system vulnerable to unauthorized access. An attacker can easily obtain the password and gain admin privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the admin password, such as a database or environment variable.
2. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information like passwords in the code.
3. Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify admin credentials.
