VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded password which is a clear violation of security best practices. This password is used for authentication purposes and should be replaced with a secure method of storing and retrieving credentials.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method of storing and retrieving credentials, such as a database or environment variables.
2. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the code.
3. Consider using a secure password hashing algorithm to store passwords securely.
