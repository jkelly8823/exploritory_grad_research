 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-798 because it contains hard-coded credentials ("scott" and "tiger") which are used to connect to the database. Hard-coded credentials can be a security risk if the credentials are compromised or if the code is shared publicly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store database credentials.
2. Consider using a connection pool to manage database connections and reduce the risk of credentials being exposed.
3. Regularly review and update database credentials to ensure they are secure and up-to-date. 4. Consider using a secrets management tool to securely store and manage sensitive data like database credentials. 5. Avoid hard-coding sensitive data like database credentials directly in the code. 6. Use a secure method to store and retrieve database credentials, such as using a secure key-value store. 7. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure database connection management. 8. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. 9. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. 10. Use a secure coding practice to store and
