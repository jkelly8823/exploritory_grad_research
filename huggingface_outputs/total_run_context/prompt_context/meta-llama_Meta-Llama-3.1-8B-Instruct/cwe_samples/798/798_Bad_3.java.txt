RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
2. Consider using a secrets management tool to securely store and manage sensitive data.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that sensitive information is not hardcoded.
