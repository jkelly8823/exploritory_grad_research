VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded password which is a clear indication of CWE-798. The password is hardcoded in the VerifyAdmin method and is used for authentication purposes. This is a security risk as the password is exposed in the code and can be easily accessed by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store the password, such as a database or a secure key store.
2. Use a secure method to authenticate the user, such as a login form or a secure authentication protocol.
3. Remove the hard-coded password from the code and replace it with a secure method of authentication.
