 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hard-coded password "Mew!" which is a clear violation of security best practices. This password is used in the VerifyAdmin function to authenticate the user. Hard-coding sensitive information such as passwords makes it easily accessible to attackers, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve passwords, such as hashing and salting.
2. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information in the code.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect.

This concludes your task. Provide your response here: 

VULNERABLE: YES
