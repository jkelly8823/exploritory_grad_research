 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-215 because it inserts the sensitive information "User account number: <%= acctNo %>" into the debugging code. This could potentially expose the account number if the debugging code is not disabled in production.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the debugging code that inserts sensitive information.
2. Use a secure method to handle sensitive information, such as encryption or secure storage.
3. Disable debugging in production environments to prevent sensitive information from being exposed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product generates error messages that may reveal sensitive information.

Code Sample:

                  try {
                        // code that may throw an exception
                        } catch (Exception e) {
                        out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
                        }
