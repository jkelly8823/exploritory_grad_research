VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-499 because the PatientRecord class does not explicitly deny serialization. This allows an attacker to serialize the class through another class and access the sensitive data, specifically the social security number. The class's private fields do not provide sufficient protection against serialization.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a private no-arg constructor to the PatientRecord class to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
2. Implement the Serializable interface and provide a custom writeObject method to control the serialization process.
3. Use a secure method to store and handle sensitive data, such as encryption or secure storage. 
4. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a Map or a custom class, to store sensitive data. 
5. Remove the public constructor and instead use a factory method to create instances of the PatientRecord class. 
6. Consider using a dependency injection framework to manage the creation and injection of instances of the PatientRecord class. 
7. Use a secure random number generator to generate the social security number. 
8. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent invalid or malicious data from being stored. 
9. Consider using a secure data
