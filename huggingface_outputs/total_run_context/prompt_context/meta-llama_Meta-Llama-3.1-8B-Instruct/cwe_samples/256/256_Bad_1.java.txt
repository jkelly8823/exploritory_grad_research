 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-256 because it stores the password in plaintext. This is a significant security risk as an attacker who gains access to the system can obtain the password and use it to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store the password, such as hashing and salting.
2. Consider using a secure password storage library to handle password storage and retrieval.
3. Ensure that the password is not logged or stored in any other location where it could be accessed by an unauthorized party. 
4. Consider implementing two-factor authentication to add an additional layer of security. 5. Regularly review and update the password storage mechanism to ensure it remains secure. 6. Consider using a secure protocol for password transmission, such as HTTPS. 7. Avoid hardcoding passwords in the code. 8. Use a secure random number generator to generate passwords. 9. Consider implementing a password policy to enforce strong password requirements. 10. Regularly monitor the system for signs of unauthorized access or password compromise. 11. Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage passwords. 12. Use a
