 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-256 because it stores the password in plaintext in the "config.properties" file. This allows an attacker to access the password and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system. The password is loaded from the file using the Properties class and then used to connect to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store the password securely using a secure password storage mechanism, such as a password hashing library.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials and passwords in configuration files.
3. Consider using environment variables or a secrets management system to store sensitive information. 
4. Regularly review and update the configuration files to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed. 5. Consider using a secure connection (e.g., SSL/TLS) to encrypt the password during transmission. 6. Use a secure password storage mechanism, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2, to store the password. 7. Avoid using the Properties class to store sensitive information, as it is not designed for secure storage. 8. Use a secure way to load the password from the file, such as using a secure file reader.
