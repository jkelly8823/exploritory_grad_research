VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is storing the LDAP username and password in plaintext in a properties file. This is a clear indication of CWE-256, as the passwords are not encrypted or hashed. An attacker who gains access to this file can obtain the credentials and potentially compromise the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store the LDAP credentials securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure secrets management system.
2. Consider using a more secure method to store sensitive information, such as encryption or hashing.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that sensitive information is handled securely.
