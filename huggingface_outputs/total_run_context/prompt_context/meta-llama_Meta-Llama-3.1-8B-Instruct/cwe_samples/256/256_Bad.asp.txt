 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a plaintext password in the connection string, which is a potential security risk. The password "password" is stored in plain text, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to store the password, such as environment variables or a secrets manager.
2. Consider using a connection string builder to separate the connection string from the code.
3. Use a secure password, not a default one like "password". 
4. Consider using a more secure database connection method, such as using a connection string with a secure password stored in a separate file or environment variable. 
5. Regularly review and update the connection string to ensure it remains secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 256 CWE Description: Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.
