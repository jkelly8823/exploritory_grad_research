 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-228 because it does not handle or incorrectly handles input that is not syntactically well-formed with respect to the associated specification. In this case, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not validate the URL before attempting to open it. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the URL is not in the expected format.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the URL before attempting to open it. This can be done by using a URL validation library or by implementing a custom validation function.
2. Consider using a more robust way to handle URLs, such as using a URL parsing library.
3. Add error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur when attempting to open the URL. This will help prevent unexpected behavior or errors.
