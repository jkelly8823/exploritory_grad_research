 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop condition that cannot be reached. The loop condition is set to `connected < 0 && count < MAX_ATTEMPTS`, but the variable `connected` is set to the result of the `connect` function, which returns -1 on failure. However, the loop will exit when `count` reaches `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, but the condition `connected < 0` will always be true because `connected` is never updated to a value greater than 0. This means that the loop will continue indefinitely, causing the program to hang.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the loop condition to check if `count` has reached `MAX_ATTEMPTS` instead of relying on the `connected` variable.
2. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism to handle connection failures. 
3. Add a timeout to the `connect` function to prevent the program from hanging indefinitely.
