VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop because the exit condition of the while loop (inventoryCount > minimumCount) can never be reached. This is because the inventoryCount is being decremented by rateSold in each iteration, but it is not being checked if the inventoryCount has reached the minimumCount. As a result, the loop will continue indefinitely until the program runs out of resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a condition to check if the inventoryCount has reached the minimumCount before decrementing it. This can be done by adding a condition to the while loop: while (inventoryCount > minimumCount && inventoryCount > 0).
2. Consider using a for loop instead of a while loop to make the code more readable and easier to understand.
3. Add a check to ensure that the rateSold is not greater than the inventoryCount to prevent negative values. This can be done by adding a condition at the beginning of the method: if (rateSold >= inventoryCount) return false;
