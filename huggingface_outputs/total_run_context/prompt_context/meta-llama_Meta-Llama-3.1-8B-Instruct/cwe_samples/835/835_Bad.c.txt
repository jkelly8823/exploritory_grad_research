VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop that will continue to try to establish a connection to the server until it is successful. However, the loop condition is based on the value of the 'connected' variable, which is set to -1 when the connection fails. Since the loop condition is 'connected < 0', the loop will continue indefinitely if the connection fails, resulting in an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the loop condition to a more reliable indicator of failure, such as checking the return value of the 'connect' function.
2. Consider using a timeout to prevent the loop from running indefinitely.
3. Add error handling to handle cases where the connection fails.
