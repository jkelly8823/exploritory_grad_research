EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided grants elevated access rights to the 'getSalary' method of the 'Employee' EJB by assigning the 'ANYONE' role. This allows any user to access the method, potentially leading to exploitation of the product. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Restrict access to the 'getSalary' method by assigning a more specific role, such as 'HR' or 'Manager', to the'method-permission' element.
2. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to further restrict access to sensitive methods. 
3. Review and update the 'assembly-descriptor' section to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted.  ```
