 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The filename is obtained from an external source (System.getProperty) and is used to create a File object without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially access files outside of the intended directory by manipulating the filename to include absolute path sequences.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the filename to ensure it does not contain any absolute path sequences.
2. Use a whitelist approach to restrict the directory to a specific path.
3. Consider using a more secure method to load the dictionary file, such as using a configuration file or a database. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses external input to construct a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization of user-controlled input.

Code Sample:

                  String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
                Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
                ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
