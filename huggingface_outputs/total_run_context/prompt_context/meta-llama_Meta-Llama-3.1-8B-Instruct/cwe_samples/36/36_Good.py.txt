VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.normpath()` function is used to normalize the path, but it does not prevent the use of absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path". This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory by providing a path that starts with a "/". For example, if the current working directory is "/home/user", and the attacker provides a filename of "/etc/passwd", the code will attempt to read the contents of the "/etc/passwd" file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `os.path.join()` function to construct the path, which will prevent the use of absolute path sequences.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the filename and ensure it only contains allowed characters.
3. Consider using a library such as `pathlib` to handle path manipulation, which provides a safer and more secure way to work with paths. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product uses an external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize path sequences that can resolve to a location
