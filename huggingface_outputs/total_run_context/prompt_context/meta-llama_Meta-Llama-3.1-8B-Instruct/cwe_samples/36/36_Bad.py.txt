 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it uses the `os.getcwd()` function to get the current working directory and then joins it with the filename using `os.path.join()`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path by providing a filename that starts with a directory separator, such as "/../". For example, if the current working directory is "/home/user" and the filename is "../secret.txt", the path would be "/home/../secret.txt", which resolves to "/secret.txt", allowing the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the filename and ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use the `os.path.abspath()` function to ensure the path is absolute and cannot be manipulated by the attacker.
3. Use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur when opening the file, and handle them accordingly.

CWE Description:
