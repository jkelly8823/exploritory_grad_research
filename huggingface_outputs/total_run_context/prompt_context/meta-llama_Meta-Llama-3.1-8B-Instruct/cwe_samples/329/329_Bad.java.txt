 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to dictionary attacks due to the use of a predictable initialization vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode. The IV is hardcoded as an array of 8 zeros, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. This allows an attacker to encrypt the same plaintext multiple times under the same key, making it susceptible to dictionary attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure random number generator to generate a unique initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation.
2. Consider using a mode of operation that is more resistant to dictionary attacks, such as Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) or Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM).
3. Avoid hardcoding the IV and instead generate it dynamically for each encryption operation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 329
CWE Description:
The product generates and uses a predictable initialization Vector (IV) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, which causes algorithms to be susceptible to dictionary attacks when they are encrypted under the same key.  VULNERABLE: YES
