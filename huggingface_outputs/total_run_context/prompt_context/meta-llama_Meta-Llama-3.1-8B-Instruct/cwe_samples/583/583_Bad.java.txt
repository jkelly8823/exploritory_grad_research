 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code declares a finalize() method as public, which is a violation of secure coding principles for mobile code. The finalize() method should be declared as protected or private to prevent it from being overridden by subclasses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the access modifier of the finalize() method from public to protected or private.
2. Consider using a try-with-resources statement or a close() method to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up when the object is garbage collected.
