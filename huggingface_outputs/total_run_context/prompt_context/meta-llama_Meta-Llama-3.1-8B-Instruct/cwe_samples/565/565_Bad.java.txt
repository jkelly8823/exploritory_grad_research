 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-565 because it relies on the existence and value of a cookie named "role" without ensuring that the cookie is valid for the associated user. This can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation if an attacker can manipulate the cookie.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the cookie's origin and ensure it is set by a trusted source.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve user roles, such as a database or a secure token.
3. Implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism to prevent unauthorized access. 
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure cookie handling and management. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security standards. 
6. Consider implementing a secure cookie flag, such as HttpOnly or Secure, to prevent JavaScript access and ensure the cookie is transmitted over a secure protocol. 
7. Use a secure random number generator to generate the cookie value. 
8. Consider using a token-based authentication system, where the token is generated and verified on each request. 
9. Regularly monitor and analyze the application's logs to detect
