 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to CWE-497 because it catches all exceptions and prints the stack trace to the console. This allows an attacker to potentially gain information about the system, such as the location of sensitive files or the configuration of the system. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to gather information that could be used to launch a targeted attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Catch specific exceptions that are expected to occur, rather than catching all exceptions.
2. Avoid printing the stack trace to the console, instead log the exception in a secure manner.
3. Consider using a logging framework that can be configured to log exceptions in a secure manner. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
