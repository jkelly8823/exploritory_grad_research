 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-497 because it uses the system function to execute a command that includes user input ($userName). This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive system-level information by manipulating the input to the command. The use of system function also makes the code vulnerable to other types of attacks such as command injection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the system function and instead use a more secure method to execute the command, such as using the exec function with proper input sanitization.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input to prevent any malicious commands from being executed.
3. Consider using a more secure method to get the current user, such as using the posix_getpwuid function. 
4. Use a secure method to execute the command, such as using the proc_open function with proper input sanitization. 
5. Consider using a library that provides a secure way to execute commands, such as the Symfony Process component. 
6. Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in a command. 
7. Consider using a secure way to get the current user, such as using the get_current_user function. 
8. Use a
