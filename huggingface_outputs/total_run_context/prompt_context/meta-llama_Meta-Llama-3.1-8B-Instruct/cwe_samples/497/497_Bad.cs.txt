 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-497 because it stores sensitive system-level information (database credentials) in a string variable that is accessible to unauthorized actors. The string variable 'cs' contains the database connection string, which includes the database name, server name, and potentially other sensitive information. This information is then printed to the console using Console.WriteLine(cs), making it accessible to anyone who can view the console output. To prevent this vulnerability, the sensitive information should be stored securely, such as in environment variables or a secure configuration file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store the database connection string in a secure location, such as an environment variable or a secure configuration file.
2. Avoid printing sensitive information to the console or logging it in a way that makes it accessible to unauthorized actors.
3. Consider using a secure method to store and retrieve sensitive information, such as a secrets manager.
