 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113) because it does not properly sanitize the user input from the request parameter "author". The input is directly used to set the value of a cookie, which can lead to an attacker injecting malicious HTTP headers into the response.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input from the request parameter "author" to ensure it only contains allowed characters.
2. Use a library like Apache Commons Lang to properly escape the input before setting the cookie value.
3. Consider using a more secure approach like using a secure cookie with the HttpOnly flag set to prevent JavaScript access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 89
CWE Description:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not properly validate or incorrectly validates the length of user-controllable input before it is used or stored.

Code Sample:

                  String username = request.getParameter("username");if (username.length() > 20) {    username = username.substring(0, 20);}String hashedPassword = passwordHash
