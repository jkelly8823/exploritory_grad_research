VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization flaw. This is because the code attempts to access a shared resource while holding a lock on a mutex, but does not ensure that the lock is held for the entire duration of the access. This creates a timing window where another thread can access the shared resource concurrently, potentially leading to data corruption or other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the lock is held for the entire duration of the access to the shared resource. This can be achieved by moving the unlock statement to after the access to the shared resource, like so:

```c
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
    /* access shared resource */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```

However, this is a very basic fix and may not be sufficient in all cases. A more robust solution would be to use a lock guard or a scope-based locking mechanism, which can automatically unlock the mutex when it goes out of scope. This can be achieved using a lock guard class or a similar construct, like so
