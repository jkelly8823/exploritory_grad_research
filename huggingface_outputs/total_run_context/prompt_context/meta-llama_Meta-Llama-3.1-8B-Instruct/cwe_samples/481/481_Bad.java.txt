 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a single equals sign (=) for assignment instead of a double equals sign (==) for comparison. This is a common mistake that can lead to unexpected behavior. In this case, the condition `if (isValid = true)` will always evaluate to true because the assignment operation returns the assigned value, which is true. This means that the code will always perform the processing, regardless of the value of `isValid`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the single equals sign with a double equals sign to ensure correct comparison. The corrected code should look like this: `if (isValid == true)`. However, it's worth noting that in Java, the `==` operator can be used to compare boolean values directly, so the condition can be simplified to just `if (isValid)`. The final corrected code would be: `if (isValid)`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 125
CWE Description:
The code uses a return statement in a method that is not declared as void.

Code Sample:

                  public void checkValid(boolean isValid) {if (isValid = true) {System.out.println("Performing processing");do
