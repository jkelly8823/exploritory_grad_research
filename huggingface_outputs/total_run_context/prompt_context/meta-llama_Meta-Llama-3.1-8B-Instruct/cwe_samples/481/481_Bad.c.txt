 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a single equals sign (=) for assignment instead of a double equals sign (==) for comparison. This is a common mistake that can lead to unexpected behavior. In this case, the condition `value=100` will always evaluate to true because the assignment operation returns the assigned value, which is 100. This means that the function will always print "Value is valid" and return 1, regardless of the input value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the single equals sign (=) with a double equals sign (==) in the condition. This will ensure that the comparison is performed correctly. The corrected code should look like this: `if (value==100)`. Additionally, consider using a more explicit comparison operator, such as `if (value == 100)`, to make the code more readable. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 665
CWE Description:
The code uses a format string that is not a string literal, which can lead to format string vulnerabilities.

Code Sample:

                  void printMessage(int value) {printf("The value is: %d", value);}
