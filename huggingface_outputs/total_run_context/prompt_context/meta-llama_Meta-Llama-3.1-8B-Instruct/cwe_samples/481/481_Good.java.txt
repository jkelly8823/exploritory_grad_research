 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a single equals sign (=) for assignment in the if statement, which is intended to be a comparison. This is a common mistake that can lead to unexpected behavior. The correct operator for comparison is the double equals sign (==).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the single equals sign (=) with the double equals sign (==) in the if statement. For example: if (isValid == true) or if (isValid) is sufficient as it is a boolean value.
