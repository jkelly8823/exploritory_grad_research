 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1422 due to the use of a pointer to a pointer (double pointer) in the line `array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];`. The double pointer is being dereferenced twice, which can lead to incorrect or stale data being forwarded to transient operations. Additionally, the use of a magic number (4096) in the calculation makes the code harder to understand and maintain.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the double pointer with a single pointer to avoid the potential issue.
2. Remove the magic number and replace it with a named constant to improve code readability.
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a buffer, to store the untrusted data. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not properly validate user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to CWE-119.

Code Sample:

				  
				  void process_input(char *input) {
				  
					// No input validation
					//...
				  
				  }
