 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-1422 because it uses an array index that is calculated based on the value of idx_array[0] and idx. This can potentially allow incorrect or stale data to be forwarded to transient operations, exposing data over a covert channel. The issue arises from the fact that idx_array[0] is set to 4096, which is likely an invalid index for the array. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially expose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the index calculation to ensure it falls within the valid range of the array.
2. Use a secure method to calculate the index, such as using a bounds-checked array access.
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or a map, to avoid array index calculations altogether.
