 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-795 because it does not properly sanitize the input from the user. The regular expression used to remove leading dots from the input does not account for all possible special characters that may be present in the input. Additionally, the code does not validate the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious input that could be used to manipulate the file path and access unauthorized files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust regular expression to sanitize the input, such as one that accounts for all possible special characters.
2. Validate the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format, such as checking that it only contains alphanumeric characters and dots.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides input validation and sanitization functionality to simplify the process. 
4. Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
5. Use a secure method to read and send the file, such as using a secure file transfer protocol. 
6. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input filtering or encoding, to further protect against potential attacks. 
7. Regularly review and update
