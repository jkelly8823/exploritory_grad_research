 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the validate_ip_regex function is vulnerable to CWE-185. The regular expression is trying to match a valid IP address, but it does not account for the case where the IP address has leading zeros. For example, the IP address "012.34.56.78" would be incorrectly matched as a valid IP address. This is because the regular expression is using the \b word boundary assertion, which does not account for leading zeros.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to account for leading zeros. This can be done by using the \d{1,3} pattern, which matches a digit between 1 and 3 times. The corrected regular expression would be: r"((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|[1-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|[1-9][0-9]?)". This regular expression will correctly match valid IP addresses
