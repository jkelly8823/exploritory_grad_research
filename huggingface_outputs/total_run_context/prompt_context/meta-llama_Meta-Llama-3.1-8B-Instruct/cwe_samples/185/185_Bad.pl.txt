 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-185 because the regular expression /\d+-\d+/ is not properly anchored, allowing for potential matches that may not be intended. This could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior when the system("lookup-phone $phone") command is executed. Additionally, the regular expression does not account for the possibility of a phone number having more than two digits before or after the hyphen.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more specific and anchored regular expression to match the expected phone number format, such as /\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/.
2. Consider using a more robust method to validate the phone number, such as using a phone number parsing library or a dedicated phone number validation service. 
3. Handle potential errors that may occur when executing the system command, such as checking the return value of the command and handling any exceptions that may be thrown.
