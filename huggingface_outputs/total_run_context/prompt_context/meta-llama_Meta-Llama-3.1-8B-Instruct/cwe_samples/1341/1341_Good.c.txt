 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to close the file handle 'f' twice. The first close operation is done implicitly when the function 'fread' is called, as it closes the file handle when it is done reading. The second close operation is done explicitly with the 'fclose' function. This is a case of double close operation, which can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the explicit close operation with 'fclose' to avoid double close operation. The corrected code should look like this:
char b[2000];
FILE *f = fopen("dbl_cls.c", "r");
if (f)
{
	b[0] = 0;
	fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);
	printf("%s\n'", b);
	printf("\n-----------------\n1 close done\n");
}
