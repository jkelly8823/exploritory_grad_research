 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to close the file handle twice, which is a double close operation. This is a potential vulnerability as it may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the second fclose() call to prevent double close operation.
2. Consider using a try-finally block to ensure the file handle is closed even if an exception occurs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable-length array (VLA) without checking its size, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

Code Sample:

int main() {
	int n = 10;
	char str[n];
	scanf("%s", str);
	printf("%s\n", str);
	return 0;
}

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a variable-length array (VLA) without checking its size, which can lead to a buffer overflow. The scanf() function does not check the size of the buffer, and if the user enters a string longer than the buffer size, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
