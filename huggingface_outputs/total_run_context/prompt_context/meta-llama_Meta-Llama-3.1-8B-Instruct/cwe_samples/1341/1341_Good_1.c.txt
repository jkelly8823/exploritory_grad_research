 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 17
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to close the file handle twice. The first close operation is successful, but the second close operation is unnecessary and may lead to undefined behavior. This is a classic example of CWE-1341, where a resource is closed more than once without any successful open between the close operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the second close operation to prevent unnecessary resource closure.
2. Consider using a try-finally block to ensure the file handle is closed regardless of whether an exception is thrown. This can be achieved by using a try-catch block and closing the file handle in the finally block.
