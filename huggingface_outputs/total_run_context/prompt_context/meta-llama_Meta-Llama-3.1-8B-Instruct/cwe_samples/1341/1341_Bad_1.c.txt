 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free the memory allocated by malloc twice. This is a potential vulnerability because it can lead to a double-free error, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. The first free operation is unnecessary and can be removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the first free operation to prevent the double-free error. The corrected code should be:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);} // Remove the second free operation. 
```
