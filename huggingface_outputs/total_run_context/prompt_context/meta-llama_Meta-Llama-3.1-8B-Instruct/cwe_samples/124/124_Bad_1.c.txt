 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of strcpy() function. The function does not perform any bounds checking, and the destination buffer is being overwritten with data from the source buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer. The line where the vulnerability is present is where the strcpy() function is called, specifically on line 5.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strncpy() to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Always check the bounds of the destination buffer before copying data into it.
3. Consider using a memory-safe function like memcpy() to copy data. 
4. Validate the input data to prevent unexpected behavior. 
5. Consider using a secure coding library or framework to help prevent common vulnerabilities like this one.  ```c
int main() {
   ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, sizeof(destBuf) - idx);
    destBuf[sizeof(destBuf) - 1] = '\0';
   ...
}
```
