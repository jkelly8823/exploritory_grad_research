 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the variable "message" is declared with a fixed size of "length+1" but then the input string is copied into it without any bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strcpy_s or strncpy to copy the input string into the buffer, which can handle buffer overflows.
2. Use a dynamic memory allocation function like realloc to allocate memory for the buffer, which can handle changing buffer sizes.
3. Always check the return value of malloc and realloc to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The product uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
                        int x;int y = 5;
                        x = y + 5;
                        printf("%d", x);
                        return 0;
                     }
