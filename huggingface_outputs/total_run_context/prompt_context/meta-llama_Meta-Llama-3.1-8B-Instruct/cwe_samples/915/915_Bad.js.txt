VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The function setValueByPath is vulnerable to CWE-915 because it does not properly control which attributes can be modified. The function uses a for loop to traverse the path array and create nested objects if they do not exist. However, it does not check if the attribute to be set is already present in the object before overwriting it. This can lead to unintended modifications to the object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to see if the attribute to be set is already present in the object before overwriting it. You can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the attribute exists in the object before assigning the new value. For example:
```
if (objectToModify[attributeToSet]!== undefined) {
  objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
} else {
  objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
}
```
However, this is not necessary as the code already handles the case where the attribute does not exist. A more accurate fix would be to add a check to ensure that the attribute to be set is not already present in the object before creating a new
