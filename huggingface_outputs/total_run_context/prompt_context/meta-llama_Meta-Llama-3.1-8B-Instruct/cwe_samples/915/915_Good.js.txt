 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The function setValueByPath is vulnerable to CWE-915 because it does not properly control which attributes can be modified. The function allows the modification of attributes that are not explicitly defined in the object, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Specifically, lines 14-16 create a new object if the attribute does not exist, which can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary attributes into the object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the attribute to be modified is explicitly defined in the object before creating a new object.
2. Use a more secure approach to handle attribute modification, such as using a whitelist of allowed attributes.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure way to handle attribute modification. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

Code Sample:

	       
		 function setValueByPath (object, path, value) {
		 
		   const pathArray = path
