 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-908 because the variable 'test_string' is assigned a string literal at the beginning, but then reassigned to a new string in the if condition. However, the printf statement is executed regardless of the if condition, which means that the original string literal is not initialized before it is accessed. This can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the 'test_string' variable with a default value before the if condition.
2. Use a single assignment for the 'test_string' variable to avoid reassignment.
3. Consider using a more robust string handling mechanism to avoid such issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that has been declared but not initialized.

Code Sample:

				int x;
				if (x > 5)
				{
				printf("x is greater than 5");
				}
				else
				{
				printf("x is less than or equal to 5");
				}
				printf("x is %d", x);
