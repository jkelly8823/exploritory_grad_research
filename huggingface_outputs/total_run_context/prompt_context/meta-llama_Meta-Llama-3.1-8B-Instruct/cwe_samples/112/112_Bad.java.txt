 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XML injection attacks because it does not validate the XML against the proper schema. The DocumentBuilderFactory is set to not validate the XML, which allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code. This is a serious vulnerability as it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the DocumentBuilderFactory to validate the XML against the proper schema by calling factory.setValidating(true).
2. Use a secure XML parser that can handle XML schema validation, such as the javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory.
3. Validate the XML against a known good schema to prevent XML injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20

The product does not properly validate user-controlled input before using it in a command or query.

Code Sample:

                  
                     // Read DOM
                     try {...DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();factory.setValidating( false );....c_dom = factory.newDocumentBuilder().parse( xmlFile );} catch(Exception ex) {...}
