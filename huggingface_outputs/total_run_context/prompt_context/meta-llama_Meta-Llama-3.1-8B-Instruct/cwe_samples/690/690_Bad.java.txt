 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-690 because it does not check for a null pointer after calling the getUserName() function. If the getUserName() function fails and returns null, the code will attempt to call the equals() method on a null object, resulting in a NullPointerException.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a null check after calling getUserName() to ensure that the returned value is not null before attempting to use it.
2. Consider using the Optional class to handle the possibility of a null return value from getUserName(). 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
