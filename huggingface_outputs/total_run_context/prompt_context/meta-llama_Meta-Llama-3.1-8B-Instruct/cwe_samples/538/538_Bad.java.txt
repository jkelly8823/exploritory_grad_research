 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-538 because it logs sensitive information (username and CCN) in a log file that may be accessible to unauthorized actors. This is a security risk as sensitive information should not be exposed to actors who are not authorized to have access to it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure logging mechanism that does not expose sensitive information to unauthorized actors.
2. Use a parameterized logging statement to prevent SQL injection or command injection attacks.
3. Consider using a secure way to store sensitive information, such as hashing or encrypting it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 89
