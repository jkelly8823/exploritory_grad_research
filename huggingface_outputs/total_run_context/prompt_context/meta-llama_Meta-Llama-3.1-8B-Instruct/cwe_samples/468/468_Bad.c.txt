VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-468, which is related to pointer arithmetic and memory access. The issue arises from the line where the pointer `second_char` is assigned the value of `p + 1`. This operation is performed in a context where `p` is a pointer to an integer, and the addition of 1 is interpreted as an increment of the pointer by the size of an integer. However, the cast to `char *` suggests that the intention is to access the next character in a string. This mismatch between the pointer type and the intended memory access can lead to undefined behavior, as the code may attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the original integer value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Ensure that the pointer arithmetic is correct and matches the intended memory access. In this case, if the intention is to access the next character in a string, the correct operation would be to increment the pointer by the size of a character (`sizeof(char)`), not the size of an integer (`sizeof(int)`).
2.  Use a more explicit and safe way to access the next character in the string, such as using a loop or a
