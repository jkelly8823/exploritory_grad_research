 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code stores sensitive information such as LDAP username and password in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere. This is a clear indication of CWE-312, where sensitive information is stored in a way that could be accessed by unauthorized parties.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive information. This will ensure that the information is not stored in cleartext and is only accessible to authorized parties. Additionally, consider using a secure protocol for LDAP authentication, such as LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS). This will encrypt the communication between the client and the LDAP server, making it more difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept sensitive information. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
