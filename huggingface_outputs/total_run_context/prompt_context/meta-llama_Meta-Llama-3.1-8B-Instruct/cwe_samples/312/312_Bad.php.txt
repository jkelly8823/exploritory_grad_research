EXPLANATION:
The code stores sensitive information (password) in cleartext within a cookie, which might be accessible to another control sphere. This is a potential security risk as an attacker could intercept the cookie and gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Hash the password before storing it in the cookie.
2. Use HTTPS to encrypt the cookie.
3. Consider using a more secure method of storing user data, such as a secure token or a session-based approach.
