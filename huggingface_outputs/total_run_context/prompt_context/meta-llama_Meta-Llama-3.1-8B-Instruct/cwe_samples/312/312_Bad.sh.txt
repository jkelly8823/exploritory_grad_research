 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-312 because it stores sensitive information (storage account credentials) in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere. The credentials are stored in the variables "MyResourceGroup" and "MyStorageAccount", which are not encrypted or masked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive information.
2. Use parameter encryption or masking to protect sensitive information in the code.
3. Consider using Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information. 
4. Review and update the code to use secure practices for storing and handling sensitive information.  ```bash
                  $env:AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT = "MyStorageAccount"
                  $env:AZURE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_GROUP = "MyResourceGroup"
                  New-AzStorageEncryptionScope -ResourceGroupName $env:AZURE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_GROUP -AccountName $env:AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT -EncryptionScopeName testscope -StorageEncryption
``` 
5. Consider using Azure CLI or PowerShell modules that provide secure ways to interact with Azure resources.  ```bash
                  Import-Module Az.Accounts
