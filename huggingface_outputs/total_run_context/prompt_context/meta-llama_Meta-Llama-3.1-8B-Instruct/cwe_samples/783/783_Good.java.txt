 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-783 because the operator precedence of the expression (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment is incorrect. The subtraction operation is performed first, resulting in a division by a potentially negative number, which can lead to incorrect results or even division by zero errors. To fix this, the expression should be rewritten to ensure the correct order of operations, for example, by using parentheses: (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Rewrite the expression to ensure correct operator precedence, for example: (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment.
2. Consider adding input validation to ensure that initialInvestment is not zero before performing the division. This can help prevent division by zero errors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
