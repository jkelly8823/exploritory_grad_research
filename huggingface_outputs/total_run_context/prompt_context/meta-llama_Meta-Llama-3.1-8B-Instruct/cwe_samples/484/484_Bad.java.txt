 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-484 because it omits a break statement within a switch construct. This causes code associated with multiple conditions to execute, which can lead to unexpected behavior. In this case, the code will print the month name and then print " is a great month" for every month, not just the intended month.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a break statement after each case to ensure that only the code associated with the current condition is executed.
2. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as an array or a map, to store the month names and their corresponding numbers. This would eliminate the need for a switch statement altogether. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product does not properly validate user input, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

    if(input.equals("admin")){
        System.out.println("Welcome, admin!");
    }else{
        System.out.println("Invalid input");
    }
