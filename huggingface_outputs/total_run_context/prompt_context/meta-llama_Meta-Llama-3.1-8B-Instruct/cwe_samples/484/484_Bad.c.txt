 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-484 because it lacks a break statement within the switch construct. This causes the code associated with multiple conditions to execute, which is not the intended behavior. The programmer likely intended to print the name of the month and then print " is a great month", but due to the missing break statements, the code will print the name of the month and then print " is a great month" for every month.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a break statement after each case in the switch construct to ensure that only the code associated with the current condition is executed.
2. Consider using a more modern and efficient way to print the names of the months, such as using an array or a map to store the month names and their corresponding numbers. This can make the code more readable and maintainable.
