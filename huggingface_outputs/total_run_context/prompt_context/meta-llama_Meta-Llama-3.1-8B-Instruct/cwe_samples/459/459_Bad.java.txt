 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-459 because it does not properly close the InputStream in a finally block. This can lead to resource leaks if an exception is thrown. The InputStream is closed in the catch block, but this is not sufficient because the catch block may not be executed if the exception is thrown before the catch block is reached. The InputStream should be closed in a finally block to ensure it is always closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Close the InputStream in a finally block to ensure it is always closed. This can be done by using a try-with-resources statement, which automatically closes the InputStream when it goes out of scope. Here is an example of how the code can be fixed: 
try (InputStream is = new FileInputStream(path)) {byte b[] = new byte[is.available()];is.read(b);} catch (Throwable t) {log.error("Something bad happened: " + t.getMessage());} 
Alternatively, you can use a finally block to close the InputStream: 
try {InputStream is = new FileInputStream(path);byte b[] = new byte[is.available()];is.read(b);} catch (Throwable t)
