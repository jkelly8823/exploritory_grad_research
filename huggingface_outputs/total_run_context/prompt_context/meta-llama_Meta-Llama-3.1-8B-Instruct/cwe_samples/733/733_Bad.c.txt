 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-733 because the compiler may optimize the memset call to pwd, which is a local variable, to be removed. This is because the compiler may determine that the variable is no longer used after the if statement. This is a classic example of a compiler optimization that can lead to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, the developer should use a compiler flag to disable the optimization of the memset call. Alternatively, the developer can use a different method to clear the password, such as using a loop to set each character to zero. This will ensure that the password is properly cleared, even if the compiler optimizes the memset call. For example: for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(pwd); i++) pwd[i] = 0; 
VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The code does not check for a return value from a function that may return an error code.

Code Sample:

                  int main() {
                        int result = GetPasswordFromUser(password, sizeof(password));
                        if (result == 0) {
                            // Password
