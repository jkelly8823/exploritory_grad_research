 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CWE-491 vulnerability because the clone() method is not declared final, allowing an object to be created without calling the constructor. This can cause the object to be in an unexpected state. The line where the vulnerability is present is line 6, where the clone() method is declared.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the clone() method should be declared final to prevent subclassing and ensure that the object is created correctly. The corrected code should look like this:
```
public final class BankAccount implements Cloneable{
    public Object clone(String accountnumber) throwsCloneNotSupportedException{
        Object returnMe = new BankAccount(accountnumber);...
    }
}
```
Note that the `final` keyword is added to the class declaration to ensure that the class cannot be subclassed, preventing the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code does not check for null pointer exceptions when accessing an object's properties.

Code Sample:

                  public class BankAccount{
                        public String getAccountNumber(){
                              return accountNumber;
                        }
                     }
               
            

This concludes your task.
