 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code defines a signal handler that contains a call to syslog() and free(). The syslog() function is not asynchronous-safe, as it can be interrupted by a signal, leading to undefined behavior. The free() function is also not asynchronous-safe, as it can be interrupted by a signal, leading to undefined behavior. Additionally, the signal handler contains a call to sleep(), which can also be interrupted by a signal, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a reentrant version of syslog() or a logging function that is asynchronous-safe.
2. Remove the call to free() from the signal handler.
3. Avoid using sleep() in a signal handler. Instead, use a non-blocking function to handle the signal. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119
CWE Description:
The program uses a variable that is not initialized before it is used.

Code Sample:

                  int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
                        int x;
