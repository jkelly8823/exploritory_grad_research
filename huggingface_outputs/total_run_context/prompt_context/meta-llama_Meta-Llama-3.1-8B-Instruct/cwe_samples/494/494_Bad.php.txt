 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-494 because it downloads and executes a remote script (dbInfo.php) without verifying its origin and integrity. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the database connection process. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user input into the SQL query.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to retrieve database credentials, such as environment variables or a secure configuration file.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious code injection.
4. Consider using a more secure database connection method, such as PDO or MySQLi. 
5. Remove the ability to download and execute remote scripts. 
6. Use a secure method to store and retrieve passwords, such as bcrypt or Argon2. 
7. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks. 
8. Regularly update and patch the database and web server software to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 
9. Implement a secure coding standard and follow best practices for secure coding. 
10. Consider using a code
