The code is vulnerable to CWE-541 because it includes sensitive information such as database credentials directly in the code. This information can be accessed by unauthorized individuals if the code is compromised or if the include file is accessible. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store database credentials securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure configuration file.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.
3. Use a secure method to store and retrieve database credentials, such as using a secrets manager.
