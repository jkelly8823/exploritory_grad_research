 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code includes a file named 'database.inc' which contains sensitive information such as database credentials. This file is accessible to anyone who has access to the server, which can lead to sensitive information being exposed. This is a classic example of CWE-541, where an include file source is accessible and contains sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store database credentials securely, such as in environment variables or a secure secrets manager.
2. Use a configuration file that is not accessible to the public, or use a secure method to store sensitive information.
3. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.
