 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the code has an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity. This is because the regular expression `^(\w+\s?)*$` uses a possessive quantifier (`*`) which can lead to catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU cycles, especially when dealing with large input strings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, consider using a more efficient regular expression that avoids possessive quantifiers. One possible solution is to use a non-greedy quantifier (`*?`) instead of the possessive quantifier (`*`). Additionally, consider using a more specific regular expression that matches the expected input format to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic backtracking. For example: `^(\w+\s?)+$` or `^[\w\s]+$`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product uses a static string that is not properly sanitized, which makes it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

Code Sample:

                        my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
                        my $bdrslt = $
