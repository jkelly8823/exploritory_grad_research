 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in this code has an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity. This is because the regular expression engine has to backtrack and retry different possibilities, leading to excessive CPU cycles. This can be a significant performance issue, especially for large inputs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more efficient regular expression that does not have exponential worst-case complexity. For example, you can use a possessive quantifier to prevent backtracking.
2. Consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure to solve the problem, if possible. 
3. If the regular expression is necessary, consider using a more efficient regular expression engine, such as the one provided by a third-party library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product uses a static string that is not properly sanitized, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.

Code Sample:

                        var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
                        var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
                        var result = test_string.search(good_pattern);
                        var static_string
