 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in this code has an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity. This is because the regular expression engine has to backtrack and retry different possibilities, leading to excessive CPU cycles. This can be a significant performance issue, especially for large inputs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more efficient regular expression that does not have exponential worst-case complexity. For example, you can use a possessive quantifier to prevent backtracking.
2. Consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure to handle the task at hand, if possible. 
3. If the regular expression is necessary, consider using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler or a specialized regular expression engine that can optimize the expression for performance.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
