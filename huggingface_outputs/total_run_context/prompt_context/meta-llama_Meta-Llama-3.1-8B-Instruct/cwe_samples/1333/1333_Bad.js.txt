 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in this code has an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity. This is because the pattern `^(\w+\s?)*$` uses a possessive quantifier (`*`) which can lead to catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU cycles, potentially leading to performance issues or even a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the possessive quantifier (`*`) with a non-possessive quantifier (`*?`) to prevent catastrophic backtracking.
2. Consider using a more efficient regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the `regex` module in Node.js.
3. If possible, avoid using regular expressions for complex pattern matching and instead use a more efficient algorithm or data structure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The product uses a static string to store sensitive information, such as a password or a secret key.

Code Sample:

                        var secret_key = "my_secret_key";
                        var encrypted_data = encrypt_data(secret_key);
                        var decrypted_data = decrypt_data(encrypted_data);
