 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-537 because it does not handle the case where the input file is not set before calling the readInputFile method. This can lead to an unhandled exception error, which an attacker can leverage to gain unauthorized access to the system. The code catches RuntimeException but does not handle it properly, leading to a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a null check for the readFile variable before creating a FileReader object in the readInputFile method.
2. Consider adding a check to ensure that the input file is set before calling the readInputFile method.
3. Handle the RuntimeException properly by logging the error and providing a meaningful error message to the user. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 20
CWE Description:
The code does not properly handle the case where the input file is not found, leading to a potential security vulnerability.

Code Sample:

                  public class InputFileRead {
                     
                        private File readFile = null;private FileReader reader = null;private String inputFilePath = null;private final String DEFAULT_FILE_PATH = "c:\\somedirectory\\";
                           public InputFileRead
