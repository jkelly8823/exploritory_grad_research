 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-537 because it does not handle the exception properly. When a FailedLoginException is thrown, the code catches it and forwards the request to the error page. However, the exception is not properly handled, and the error message is not logged or reported. This can lead to unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Log the exception: Add a logging statement to log the exception, including the username and password.
2. Report the exception: Consider reporting the exception to a security incident response team or a logging system.
3. Improve error handling: Improve the error handling to provide more information about the exception, such as the username and password.
4. Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism: Consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
