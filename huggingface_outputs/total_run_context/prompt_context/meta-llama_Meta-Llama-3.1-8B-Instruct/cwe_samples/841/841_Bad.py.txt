 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-841 because it does not properly ensure that the actor performs the behaviors in the required sequence. In this case, the sequence is 'Login' followed by 'Retrieve_file'. The code allows the 'Retrieve_file' command to be executed without first executing the 'Login' command, which is a required behavior. This can lead to unauthorized access to files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the 'Login' command is executed before allowing the 'Retrieve_file' command. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the user is logged in before processing the command.
2. Consider using a state machine to manage the sequence of behaviors and ensure that they are performed in the correct order. This can help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
