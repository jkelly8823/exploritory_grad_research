 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-293 because it relies on the referer field in HTTP requests to check for message integrity. However, the referer field can be easily modified by an attacker, making it an unreliable means of authentication. In this case, the code checks if the referer field matches a hardcoded trusted referer URL, but this is not a secure practice. An attacker could simply modify the referer field to match the trusted URL and gain unauthorized access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method of authentication, such as checking the client's IP address or using a secure token.
2. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure way to handle HTTP requests and authentication.
3. Remove the hardcoded trusted referer URL and instead use a configuration file or database to store trusted URLs. This will make it easier to manage and update trusted URLs in the future.
