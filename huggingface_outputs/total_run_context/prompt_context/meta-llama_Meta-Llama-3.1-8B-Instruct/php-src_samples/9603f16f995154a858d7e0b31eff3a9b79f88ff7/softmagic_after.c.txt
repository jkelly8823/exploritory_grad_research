 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3538 because it does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search. The variable bytecnt is not properly bounded, which can lead to a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the bytecnt variable is properly bounded to prevent excessive memory usage.
2. Consider using a more robust regex engine that is less prone to backtracking.
3. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent excessive regex backtracking. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.  The code is vulnerable to this issue because it does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search. The
