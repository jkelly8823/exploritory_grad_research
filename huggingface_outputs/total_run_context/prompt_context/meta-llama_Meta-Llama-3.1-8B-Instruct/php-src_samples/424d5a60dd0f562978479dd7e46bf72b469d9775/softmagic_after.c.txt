VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. The issue arises from the fact that the amount of data read during a regex search is not properly restricted. This can be exploited by a remote attacker who can trigger backtracking during processing of an awk rule, leading to excessive CPU consumption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Restrict the amount of data read during a regex search by implementing a proper limit on the number of bytes to be read.
2. Implement a mechanism to prevent backtracking during regex processing, such as using a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) or a lookahead mechanism.
3. Update the regex engine to fix the incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. This may involve re-implementing the regex engine or applying a patch to the existing implementation. 4. Regularly test and audit the regex engine to ensure that it is free from vulnerabilities. 5. Consider using a more secure regex engine, such as one that uses a DFA or a lookahead mechanism. 6. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from triggering
