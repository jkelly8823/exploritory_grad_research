 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-3414. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper dequoting of collation-sequence names. This can be exploited by crafting a malicious COLLATE clause in a SELECT statement, leading to a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly other unspecified impacts.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the SQLite library to version 3.8.9 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper dequoting of collation-sequence names in the code.
3. Use a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
