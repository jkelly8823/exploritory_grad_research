 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the "httpoxy" issue because it does not properly handle the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. The variable is not sanitized or validated, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary proxy server information. This can lead to a situation where the application's outbound HTTP traffic is redirected to an arbitrary proxy server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. This can be done by removing the variable from the $params array or by sanitizing and validating its value. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a more secure method of making HTTP requests, such as using a library that properly handles proxy servers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5385
CVE Description: 
PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request
