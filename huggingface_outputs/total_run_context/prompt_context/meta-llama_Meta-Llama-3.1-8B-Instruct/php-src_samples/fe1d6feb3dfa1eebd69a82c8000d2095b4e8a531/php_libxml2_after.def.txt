 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not directly contain the vulnerable function xsltStylePreCompute. However, it does contain functions that are part of the libxslt library, which is known to contain the vulnerable function. This suggests that the code is using the vulnerable library, making it vulnerable to the type confusion issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Update the libxslt library to a version that is not vulnerable (e.g., 1.1.29 or later). Alternatively, use a different library that does not contain the vulnerable function. If updating the library is not feasible, consider using a sandboxed environment to isolate the vulnerable code and prevent it from affecting other parts of the system.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-3118
CVE Description:
The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.1 to 2.4.17 mod_authz_core module allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server hang or crash) via a crafted request that triggers a large amount of memory allocation in the ap_authz_check_access function.
