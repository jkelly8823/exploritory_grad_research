 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) due to the mishandling of the /((?:F?+(?:^(?(R)a+\"){99}-))(?J)(?'R'(?'R'<((?'RR'(?'R'\){97)?J)?J)(?'R'(?'R'\){99|(:(?|(?'R')(\k'R')|((?'R')))H'R'R)(H'R))))))/ pattern and related patterns with named subgroups. This vulnerability is present in the pcre_compile2 function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE 8.38.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the PCRE library to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. Use a secure regular expression that does not match the vulnerable pattern.
3. Implement a safe regular expression parser that can handle the vulnerable pattern without causing a denial of service. 
4. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using regular expressions that can cause a denial of service.  ```ash
