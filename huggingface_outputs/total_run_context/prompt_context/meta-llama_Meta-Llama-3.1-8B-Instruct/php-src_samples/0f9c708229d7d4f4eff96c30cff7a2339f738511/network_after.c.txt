 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18. This is due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to this issue. The code checks if the hostname is longer than MAXHOSTNAMELEN, but this does not prevent the buffer overflow, as the buffer is not properly checked for overflow before being used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with a safer alternative, such as getaddrinfo.
2. Use a safer function to check the length of the hostname, such as strlcpy.
3. Use a buffer size check to prevent the buffer overflow.
4. Consider using a more secure library, such as the one provided by the OpenSSL project.
