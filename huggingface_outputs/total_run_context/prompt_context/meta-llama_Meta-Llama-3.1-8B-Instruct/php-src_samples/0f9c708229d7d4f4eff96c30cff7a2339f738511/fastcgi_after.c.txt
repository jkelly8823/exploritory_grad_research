 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2015-0235 heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The code does not use the gethostbyname or gethostbyname2 functions, which are the functions that are vulnerable to this issue. The code instead uses the gethostbyname function, which is not vulnerable to this issue. However, the code does not check for the length of the host name before passing it to the gethostbyname function, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the host name is very long. This is not the same as the CVE-2015-0235 vulnerability, but it is still a potential issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check the length of the host name before passing it to the gethostbyname function to prevent potential buffer overflows. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the length of the host name is less than MAXHOSTNAMELEN.
