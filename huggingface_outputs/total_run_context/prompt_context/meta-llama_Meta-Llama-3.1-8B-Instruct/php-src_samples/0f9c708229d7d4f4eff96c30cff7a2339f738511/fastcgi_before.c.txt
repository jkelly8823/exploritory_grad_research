VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function. This function is known to be vulnerable to CVE-2015-0235, a GHOST vulnerability. The code calls gethostbyname and then checks the result, but it does not check the length of the buffer returned by gethostbyname. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as it is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. If gethostbyname must be used, check the length of the buffer returned by gethostbyname to prevent buffer overflow.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to gethostbyname, such as the gethostbyname_r function, which is designed to be safer and more secure. 4. Always validate user input to prevent potential attacks. 5. Consider using a library that provides a safer and more secure way to perform DNS lookups, such as the c-ares library. 6. Always keep your system and libraries up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches. 7. Consider using a
