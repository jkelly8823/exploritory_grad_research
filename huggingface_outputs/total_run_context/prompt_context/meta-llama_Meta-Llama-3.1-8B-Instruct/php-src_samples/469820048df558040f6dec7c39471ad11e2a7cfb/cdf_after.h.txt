 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly interacts with the cdf_read_property_info function in cdf.c. The code defines constants and macros but does not include any code that could potentially lead to a heap-based buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds write. However, it's essential to note that the vulnerability is related to the cdf_read_property_info function, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could lead to the CVE-2019-18218 vulnerability. However, if this code is used in conjunction with the cdf_read_property_info function, it's crucial to ensure that the function is properly implemented and restricted to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18218
CVE Description:
cdf_read_property_info in cdf.c in file through 5.37 does not restrict the number of CDF_VECTOR elements, which allows a heap-based buffer overflow (4-byte out-of-bounds write).  Code Sample: 
int32_t cdf_read_property_info(cdf_secid_t secid,
