 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of restriction on the number of CDF_VECTOR elements. The function cdf_read_property_info in cdf.c does not limit the number of elements in the CDF_VECTOR, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer by writing 4 bytes out of bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a check to limit the number of CDF_VECTOR elements to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use a safer function to read the number of elements, such as CDF_GETUINT32 with bounds checking.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the CDF_VECTOR elements. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18218
