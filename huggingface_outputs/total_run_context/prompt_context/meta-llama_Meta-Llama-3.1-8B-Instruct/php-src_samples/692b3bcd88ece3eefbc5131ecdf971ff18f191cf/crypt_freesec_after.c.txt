 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability because it does not properly handle passwords that contain the 0x80 character. The while loop in lines 5-7 shifts the bits of the password to the left by one place, but it does not account for the case where the password contains a 0x80 character. This can cause the password to be truncated, making it easier for attackers to obtain access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the password for the 0x80 character before processing it.
2. Use a more robust password hashing algorithm that can handle Unicode characters.
3. Use a library that properly handles password hashing, such as OpenSSL. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial
