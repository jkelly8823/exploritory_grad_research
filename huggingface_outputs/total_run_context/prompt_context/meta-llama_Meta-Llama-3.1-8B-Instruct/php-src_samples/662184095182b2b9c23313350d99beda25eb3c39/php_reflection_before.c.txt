EXPLANATION:
The variable "property_info" is not initialized before it is used. This can lead to unpredictable results as the memory location pointed to by "property_info" may contain garbage values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the "property_info" variable before using it. This can be done by assigning it a valid memory location using the "zend_property_info_init" function. For example:
```php
zend_property_info_init(&property_info);
``` VULNERABILITY LIST: CWE_ID: 476 CWE Description: The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results. Code Sample: ```php if (zend_get_property_info(ce, hash_key->key, 1) == NULL) { zend_property_info property_info; property_info.flags = ZEND_ACC_IMPLICIT_PUBLIC; property_info.name = hash_key->key; property_info.ce = ce; property_info.offset = -1; ``` VULNERABLE: YES VULNERABLE_LINES: 2 EXPLANATION: The variable "property_info" is not initialized before it is used.
