 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to the use of multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions in the regular expression in the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands in file before 5.15. This is not directly applicable to this code, but the code does contain a similar pattern of using a large amount of backtracking, which can cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file that triggers a large amount of backtracking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Avoid using large amounts of backtracking in regular expressions. Instead, use more specific patterns that do not rely on unlimited repetitions. Additionally, consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure to handle large amounts of data. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-7345
CVE Description:
The BEGIN regular expression in the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands in file before 5.15 uses multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file that triggers a large amount of backtracking, as demonstrated via a file with many
