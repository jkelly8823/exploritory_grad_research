VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.  The code sample does not contain any regex searches or file processing, so it is not vulnerable to this issue.  The code is simply outputting a string and does not involve any file operations or regex searches.  Therefore, it is not susceptible to this vulnerability.  The code does not need any modifications to address this issue.  The code is secure.  The code does not contain any
