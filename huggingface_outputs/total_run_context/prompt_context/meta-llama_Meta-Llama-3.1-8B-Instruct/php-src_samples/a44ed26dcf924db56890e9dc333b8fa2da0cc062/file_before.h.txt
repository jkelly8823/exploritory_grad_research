 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. This vulnerability exists because the amount of data read during a regex search is not properly restricted. The code uses the `awk` rule to process the file, which can lead to backtracking during processing, causing a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search. This can be achieved by using a more efficient regex engine or by implementing a limit on the number of iterations allowed during the search. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other regex-related vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-734
