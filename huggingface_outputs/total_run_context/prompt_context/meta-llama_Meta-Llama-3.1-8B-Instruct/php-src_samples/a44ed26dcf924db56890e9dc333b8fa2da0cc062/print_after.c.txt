 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The asctime_r function is used to format the time into a string, but the buffer size is not checked. If the time string is longer than the buffer size, it will overflow and potentially cause a crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the buffer size before calling asctime_r to ensure it is large enough to hold the formatted time string.
2. Use a safer function like strftime to format the time string, which allows for more control over the buffer size and format.
3. Consider using a safer function like gmtime_r or localtime_r to get the current time, which do not have the same buffer overflow vulnerability as asctime_r. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
