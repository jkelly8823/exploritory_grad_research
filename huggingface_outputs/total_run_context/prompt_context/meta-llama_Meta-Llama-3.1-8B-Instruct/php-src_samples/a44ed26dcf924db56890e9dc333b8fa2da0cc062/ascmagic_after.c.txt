 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. The file_softmagic function is called with a large amount of data, which can cause backtracking during processing of an awk rule, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the file library to version 5.19 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Limit the amount of data passed to the file_softmagic function to prevent excessive CPU consumption.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the file library, such as a library that uses a more efficient algorithm for regex searches.  ```bash
