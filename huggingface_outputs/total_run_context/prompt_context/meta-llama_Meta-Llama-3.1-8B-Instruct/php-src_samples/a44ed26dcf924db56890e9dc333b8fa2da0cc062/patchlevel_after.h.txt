 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to a regex search backtracking issue. This is because the file version is 5.19 or earlier, which is affected by CVE-2014-3538. The patchlevel is 22, which is lower than the required patchlevel of 19 to fix this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Update the file version to 5.20 or later, and update the patchlevel to 19 or higher to fix this vulnerability. Additionally, consider updating the code to use a more secure regex engine or implementing additional security measures to prevent backtracking. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.  The patchlevel is not sufficient to fix this vulnerability.  The patchlevel is
