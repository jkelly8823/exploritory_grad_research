 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. The file function before version 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search. This can be exploited by a remote attacker by crafting a file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the file function to version 5.19 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent excessive CPU consumption during regex searches.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the file function, such as a custom implementation or a third-party library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
