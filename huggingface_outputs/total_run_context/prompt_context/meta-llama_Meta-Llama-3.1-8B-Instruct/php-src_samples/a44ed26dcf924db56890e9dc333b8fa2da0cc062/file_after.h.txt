 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. The vulnerability exists because the amount of data read during a regex search is not properly restricted. This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by crafting a file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Restrict the amount of data read during a regex search by implementing a proper limit.
2. Update the code to fix the incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent denial of service attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
