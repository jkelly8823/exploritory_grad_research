 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an indirect recursion nesting exceeded error in the finfo_file() function. This is a result of a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule, which is a known issue in file versions before 5.19.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade the file version to 5.19 or later to prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, ensure that the file is properly configured to prevent indirect recursion nesting. This can be achieved by setting the'recursion_limit' option in the php.ini file or by using the 'finfo_buffer' function instead of 'finfo_file'. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.  This vulnerability is related to the indirect recursion nesting exceeded error
