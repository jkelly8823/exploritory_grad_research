 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. The issue arises from the fact that the file function does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search. This can be exploited by a remote attacker who can trigger backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the file function to properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search.
2. Implement a mechanism to prevent backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date.
