 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code is using the finfo_file() function to determine the MIME type of a file, and it is not using regex rules to search for patterns in the file. The issue described in CVE-2014-3538 is related to the use of regex rules in the finfo_file() function, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to ensure that the finfo_file() function is being used correctly and that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed in the underlying library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
