VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.  This vulnerability is related to the file command, not the code sample provided.  The code sample is a C library for magic number detection, and it does not contain
