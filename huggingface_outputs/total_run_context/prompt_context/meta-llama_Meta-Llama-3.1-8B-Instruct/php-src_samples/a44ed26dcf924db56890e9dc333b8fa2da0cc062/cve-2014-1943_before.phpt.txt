 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to the use of the finfo_file() function, which can cause backtracking during processing of an awk rule. This is because the finfo_file() function is not properly restricted in terms of the amount of data it reads during a regex search.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the finfo library to a version that properly restricts the amount of data read during a regex search.
2. Use a more secure alternative to finfo_file(), such as the fileinfo extension.
3. Implement a timeout or limit on the amount of data read by finfo_file() to prevent excessive CPU consumption. 4. Consider using a more secure file parsing library, such as the file library. 5. Regularly update and patch the system to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 6. Implement a secure coding practice of validating user input to prevent potential attacks. 7. Use a secure coding practice of using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. 8. Use a secure coding practice of using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 9. Use a secure coding practice of validating
