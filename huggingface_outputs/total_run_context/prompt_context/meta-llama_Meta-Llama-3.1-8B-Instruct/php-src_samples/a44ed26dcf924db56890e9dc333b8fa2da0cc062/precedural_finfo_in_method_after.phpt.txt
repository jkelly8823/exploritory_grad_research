VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the exploitation of CVE-2014-3538. However, the code does contain a PHP header that is being echoed. This could potentially be used to inject malicious code if not properly sanitized. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that any user input is properly sanitized before being used in the code.
