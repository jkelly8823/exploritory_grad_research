 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345. The file function does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which can be exploited by a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the file function to properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search.
2. Implement a mechanism to prevent backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the file function, such as a library that provides a safe and efficient way to perform regex searches. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3538
