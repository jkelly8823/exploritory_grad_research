 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the temporary disabling of magic_quotes_gpc. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the environment variables. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the magic_quotes_gpc directive is altered and restored.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the temporary disabling of magic_quotes_gpc and instead use a more secure method to handle environment variables.
2. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Consider upgrading to a more secure version of PHP, such as PHP 5.3.10 or later. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-0831
CVE Description:
PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm_main.c.  ```
