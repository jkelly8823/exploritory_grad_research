 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential issue due to the use of the PHP_OCI_CALL_RETURN macro. This macro is used to handle the return value of the OCISTMTGETNEXTRESULT function, but it does not properly check for errors. If the OCISTMTGETNEXTRESULT function returns an error code, the PHP_OCI_CALL_RETURN macro will not catch it, and the error will not be properly handled. This could potentially lead to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a try-catch block to catch any potential errors that may be returned by the OCISTMTGETNEXTRESULT function.
2. Check the return value of the OCISTMTGETNEXTRESULT function to ensure that it is not an error code.
3. Use a more robust error handling mechanism, such as the PHP error handling functions, to properly handle any errors that may occur.
