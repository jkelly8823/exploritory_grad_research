 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function or any other known vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a snippet from a build configuration file, likely for the PHP project, and deals with adding providerdesc.o into global objects and handling DTrace objects. There is no indication of any potential security issues or code that could be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that require attention. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date and follow best practices for secure coding. Consider reviewing the code for any potential issues and ensuring that all dependencies are up-to-date. Additionally, consider implementing a code review process to catch any potential security issues before they become a problem.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
