 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the OpenSSL library or its functions. The vulnerability described in the CVE is related to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in the Ruby OpenSSL library, which is not present in this C code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code. However, if this code is intended to interact with an SSL/TLS connection, it is recommended to ensure that the OpenSSL library is properly configured and updated to the latest version to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure connection establishment method, such as using the OpenSSL library's built-in functions for SSL/TLS connections.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
