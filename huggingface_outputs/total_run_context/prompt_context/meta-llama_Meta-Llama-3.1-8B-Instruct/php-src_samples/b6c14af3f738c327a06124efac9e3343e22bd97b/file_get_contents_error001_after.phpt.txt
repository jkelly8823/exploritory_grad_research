 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. The code is written in PHP and does not use the OpenSSL library, which is the library affected by the CVEs. The code does use the file_get_contents function, but this function is not affected by the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the specified CVEs. However, it is recommended to ensure that the file_get_contents function is properly configured and tested to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, it is recommended to consider using a more secure method for retrieving the IP address, such as using a secure API or a library that handles SSL/TLS connections securely.  The use of the null value for the context parameter in the file_get_contents function is also worth considering, as it may not be the most secure option.  It is also worth considering the use of a timeout value that is more secure, such as 10 seconds.  The use of the 1 as the stream context option is also worth considering, as it may not be the most secure option.  It is also worth considering the use of a more secure method for handling the IP
