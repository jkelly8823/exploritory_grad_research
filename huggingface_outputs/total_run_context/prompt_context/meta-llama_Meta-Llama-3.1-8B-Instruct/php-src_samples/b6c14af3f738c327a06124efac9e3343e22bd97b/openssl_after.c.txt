 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 34-40
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073, a man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. The code is using the OpenSSL library to parse and verify X.509 certificates, and it is not properly handling the '\0' character in the domain name. This allows an attacker to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073.
2. Use a secure method to handle the '\0' character in the domain name, such as using a secure string library.
3. Validate the input data to ensure that it does not contain any malicious characters.
4. Consider using a more secure method to verify the certificate, such as using a certificate validation library.
