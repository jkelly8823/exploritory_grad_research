 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (tbuf) to store the result of the similar_str function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input strings are large, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Increase the size of the tbuf buffer to a dynamically allocated size based on the length of the input strings.
- Use a safer function to copy the result of similar_str into the tbuf buffer, such as strncpy or memcpy.
- Consider using a more secure string comparison function that is less prone to buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4073
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
