 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function vulnerability. The code is using the DTRACE_EXCEPTION_THROWN macro, which is not related to the OpenSSL library. The vulnerability is related to the handling of X.509 certificates, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to ensure that the DTRACE_EXCEPTION_THROWN macro is being used correctly and that the code is being compiled with the HAVE_DTRACE flag enabled. This will help prevent any potential issues with the macro.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4073
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in
