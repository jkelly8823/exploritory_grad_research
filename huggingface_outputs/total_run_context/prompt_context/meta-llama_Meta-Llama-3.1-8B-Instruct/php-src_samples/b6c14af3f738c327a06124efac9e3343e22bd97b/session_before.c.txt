 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function vulnerability (CVE-2013-4073). This function is specific to Ruby and is not applicable to the provided PHP code. The code sample appears to be using PHP's built-in hash functions (PHP_MD5_CTX and PHP_SHA1_CTX) and does not involve any Ruby-specific code or OpenSSL functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices to prevent other potential vulnerabilities. Consider using a secure hash function and validating user input to prevent other types of attacks.  ```
