 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking in the inclusion of header files. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file.
- Use a consistent naming convention for the include files.
- Consider using a build system that can handle dependencies and include files more efficiently.
- Use a static analyzer or code review tool to catch potential issues like this in the future.
