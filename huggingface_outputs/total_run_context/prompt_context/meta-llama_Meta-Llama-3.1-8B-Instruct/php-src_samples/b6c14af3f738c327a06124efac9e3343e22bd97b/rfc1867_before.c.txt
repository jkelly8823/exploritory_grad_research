 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the snprintf function without checking the length of the buffer. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious data into the lbuf variable, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the strlcpy function instead of snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Always check the length of the buffer before copying data into it.
3. Consider using a safer function like sprintf or snprintf with a safe maximum length to prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4073
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued
