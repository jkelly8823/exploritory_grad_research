 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is due to the fact that the code does not check for the presence of '\0' characters in the domain name before using it to verify the certificate identity.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for the presence of '\0' characters in the domain name before using it to verify the certificate identity.
2. Use a secure method to handle the domain name, such as using a library that properly handles '\0' characters.
3. Update the OpenSSL library to the latest version, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.
