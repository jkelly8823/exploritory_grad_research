 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function vulnerability. The code is written in C and does not appear to be using the OpenSSL library or any related functions. The vulnerability is specific to Ruby and its OpenSSL implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to this issue. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any cryptographic functions used in the code are properly implemented and up-to-date. Consider using a secure hash function and verifying the integrity of any certificates used in the code.  The code does not appear to be using any certificates or cryptographic functions, so this is not a concern in this specific case.
