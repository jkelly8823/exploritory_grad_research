 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073 due to the presence of a function named `php_error_docref0` which is not properly sanitized. This function is used to handle errors and warnings in PHP, but it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the PHP version to the latest one, which includes the fix for CVE-2013-4073.
2. Use a secure alternative to `php_error_docref0`, such as `php_error_docref` or `php_error`.
3. Sanitize the input to `php_error_docref0` to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.
