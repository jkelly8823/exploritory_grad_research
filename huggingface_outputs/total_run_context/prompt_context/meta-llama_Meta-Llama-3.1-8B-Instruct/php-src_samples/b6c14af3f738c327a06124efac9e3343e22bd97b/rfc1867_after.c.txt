 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the _i64toa_s function on Windows, which does not check for buffer overflows. On other platforms, the snprintf function is used, but it does not check for buffer overflows either. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the total_bytes variable exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a long integer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function to convert the total_bytes variable to a string, such as sprintf or snprintf with a checked buffer size.
2. Use a library that provides a safe way to handle large integers, such as the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP).
3. Implement bounds checking for the total_bytes variable to prevent it from exceeding the maximum value that can be stored in a long integer.
