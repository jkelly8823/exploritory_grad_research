 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (buffer[97]) to store the formatted date string. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Increase the size of the buffer to a more secure size, such as using a dynamically allocated buffer or a safer string library.
- Consider using a safer string library, such as a library that uses a heap-based buffer instead of a stack-based buffer.
- Consider using a safer formatting function, such as one that uses a buffer size parameter to prevent buffer overflows.
