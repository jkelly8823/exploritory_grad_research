 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. The code is checking for the presence of an exception and then using the DTRACE_EXCEPTION_THROWN macro to log the exception information. This does not involve any SSL or certificate verification, which is the focus of the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the specified vulnerabilities.  The code is using the DTRACE_EXCEPTION_THROWN macro which is not related to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function.  The code is also not using the OpenSSL library to verify certificates.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the specified CVEs.  However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches.  The code should be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code should also be tested thoroughly to ensure it is working as expected.  The code should also be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed for any
