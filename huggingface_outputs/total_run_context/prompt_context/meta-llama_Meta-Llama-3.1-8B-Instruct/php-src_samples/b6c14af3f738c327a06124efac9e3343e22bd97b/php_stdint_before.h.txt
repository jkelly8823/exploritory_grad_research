 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247. The code is a header file that defines macros for integer types and includes a platform-specific header file for Windows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that this code is a header file and does not contain any executable code. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to any of the described vulnerabilities.
