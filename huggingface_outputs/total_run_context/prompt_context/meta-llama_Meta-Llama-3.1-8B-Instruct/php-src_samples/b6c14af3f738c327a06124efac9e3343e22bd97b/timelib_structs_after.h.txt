 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247. The code is a C header file that includes other header files and defines some types and macros. It does not contain any code that would be related to the OpenSSL library or the verification of SSL certificates.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the specified vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the included header files are up-to-date and secure, and that the code is reviewed regularly for any potential security issues. Additionally, it is recommended to use secure coding practices and follow best practices for secure coding.  The code does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3
