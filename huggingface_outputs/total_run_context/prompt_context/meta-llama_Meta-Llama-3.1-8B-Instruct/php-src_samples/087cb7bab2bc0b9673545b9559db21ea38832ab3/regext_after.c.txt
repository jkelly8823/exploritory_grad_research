 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability in the onig_new_deluxe() function. This is because the einfo->par pointer is set to NULL without checking if it has already been freed. If the einfo->par pointer has already been freed, this can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the einfo->par pointer has already been freed before setting it to NULL.
2. Use a smart pointer to manage the memory of einfo->par to prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure way to handle memory management, such as using a garbage collector. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-13224
CVE Description:
A use-after-free in onig_new_deluxe() in regext.c in Oniguruma 6.9.2 allows attackers to potentially cause information disclosure, denial of service, or possibly code execution by providing a crafted regular expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern and a string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by onig_new_deluxe(). On
