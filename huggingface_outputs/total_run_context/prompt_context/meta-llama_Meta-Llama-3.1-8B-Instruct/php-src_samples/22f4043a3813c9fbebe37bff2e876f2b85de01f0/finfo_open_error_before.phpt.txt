 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a PHP warning due to the finfo::finfo() function expecting a long parameter but receiving a string instead. This warning can potentially lead to a security vulnerability if not addressed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the parameter passed to finfo::finfo() is a long value.
2. Consider upgrading PHP to a version that has fixed this issue (PHP 5.3.10 or later).
3. Use error handling to suppress or handle this warning.
