 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any PHP code, and therefore does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0831. The code sample appears to be a list of file names, which are not executable code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any PHP code, so there is no need for any fixes. However, if the intention is to use PHP, it is recommended to use a version that is not vulnerable to this issue, such as PHP 5.3.10 or later.  The code sample should be replaced with actual PHP code to be analyzed for vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to ensure that the PHP code is properly configured to prevent SQL injection attacks.  This can be achieved by setting the magic_quotes_gpc directive to ON, or by using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Additionally, it is recommended to keep the PHP code up to date with the latest security patches.  It is also recommended to use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against SQL injection attacks.  It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice such as input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL
