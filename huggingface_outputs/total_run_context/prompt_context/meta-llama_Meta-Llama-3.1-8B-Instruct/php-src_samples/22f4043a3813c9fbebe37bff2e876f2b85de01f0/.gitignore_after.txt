 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any PHP code, and the vulnerability is specific to PHP. The code appears to be a configuration file for PHP, listing specific ignores for testing and extension-specific ignores. There is no indication of any code that could be exploited to conduct SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any PHP code that could be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the PHP configuration and ensure that the magic_quotes_gpc directive is properly set to prevent potential SQL injection attacks. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the PHP version up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-0831
CVE Description:
PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm_main.c.  Code Sample: 
main/php_variables.c 
int php_variables
