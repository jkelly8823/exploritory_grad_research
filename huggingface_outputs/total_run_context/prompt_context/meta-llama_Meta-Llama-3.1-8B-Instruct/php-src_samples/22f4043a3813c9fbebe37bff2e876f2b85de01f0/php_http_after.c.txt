 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. This is related to the importing of environment variables, which can be exploited by a remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to version 5.3.10 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Disable magic_quotes_gpc and use alternative methods to sanitize user input. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-0831
CVE Description:
PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm_main.c.  This vulnerability is present in the code snippet provided. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the code snippet provided, but it is not directly exploitable in this specific code. However, it is still a vulnerability that should be
