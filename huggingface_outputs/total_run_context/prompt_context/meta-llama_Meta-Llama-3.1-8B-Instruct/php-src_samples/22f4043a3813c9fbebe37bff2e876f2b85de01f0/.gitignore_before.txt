 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any PHP code, and the vulnerability is specific to PHP. The vulnerability is related to the importing of environment variables and the magic_quotes_gpc directive, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any PHP code, so there is no need for any fixes. However, if this code is being used in a PHP project, it is recommended to ensure that the PHP version is up to date and that the magic_quotes_gpc directive is properly configured.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-0831
CVE Description:
PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm_main.c.  Code Sample: 
main/php_variables.c
int php_variables_init(void)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < PHP_MAX_VARIABLES;
