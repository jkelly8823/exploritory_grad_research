There is no indication of any SQL injection vulnerability in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it would be a good practice to review the implementation of the do_translit function to ensure it does not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, it would be beneficial to ensure that the do_translit function is properly sanitized to prevent any potential security issues.
