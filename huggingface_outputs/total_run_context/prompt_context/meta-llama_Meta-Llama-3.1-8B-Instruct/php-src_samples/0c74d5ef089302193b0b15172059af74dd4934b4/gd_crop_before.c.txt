 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (application crash) due to the lack of error checking in the gdImageCrop function. The function does not check the return values of the gdImageCreateTrueColor and gdImageCreate functions, which can return NULL if the image creation fails. This can lead to a NULL pointer being used as a return value, causing a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error checking for the return values of gdImageCreateTrueColor and gdImageCreate.
2. Handle the error case where the image creation fails, for example by returning an error message or throwing an exception.
3. Consider using a more robust image creation function that does not return NULL on failure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-7327
CVE Description:
The gdImageCrop function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 does not check return values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via invalid imagecrop arguments that lead to use of a NULL pointer as a return value,
