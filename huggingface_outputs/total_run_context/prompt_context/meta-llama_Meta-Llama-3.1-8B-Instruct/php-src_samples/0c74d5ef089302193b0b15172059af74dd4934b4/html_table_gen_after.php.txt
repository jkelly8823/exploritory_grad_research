 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described issue. The gdImageCrop function is not used in this code, and the code does not involve image processing. The vulnerability is specific to the gdImageCrop function in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9, which is not relevant to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly tested and reviewed for other potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of the ksort function on large arrays can be inefficient and may cause performance issues.
