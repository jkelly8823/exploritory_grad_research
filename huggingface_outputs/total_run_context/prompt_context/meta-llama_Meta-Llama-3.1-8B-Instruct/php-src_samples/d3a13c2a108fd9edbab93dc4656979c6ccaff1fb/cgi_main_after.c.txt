 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823 because it does not properly handle query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the query string. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the decoded query string is checked for the presence of an equals sign and the '-' character.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the decoded query string contains an equals sign before checking for the '-' character.
2. Consider using a more robust parsing mechanism for query strings to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 
3. Ensure that the php_getopt function is called with the correct options and arguments to prevent command-line options from being executed as code.
