 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235) because it uses the gethostbyname function, which is affected by this vulnerability. The gethostbyname function is deprecated and should not be used in new code. The code also does not check for the presence of the h_addr_list[0] before accessing it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with the getaddrinfo function, which is the recommended replacement.
2. Check for the presence of h_addr_list[0] before accessing it to prevent null pointer dereference.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure way to resolve host names, such as using a DNS library.  ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netdb.h>

#define MAX_HOSTNAME 256

int main() {
    char hostname[MAX_HOSTNAME];
    struct sockaddr_in sa;
    struct hostent *hep;

    // Get the hostname from
