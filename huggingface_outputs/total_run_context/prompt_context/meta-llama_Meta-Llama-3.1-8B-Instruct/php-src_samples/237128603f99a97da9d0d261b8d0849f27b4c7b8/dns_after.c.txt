 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for the length of the hostname before calling gethostbyname. If the hostname is too long, it will return false instead of attempting to call gethostbyname. This prevents the potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code already checks for the hostname length and prevents the potential vulnerability. However, it would be beneficial to add a check for the return value of gethostbyname to ensure it is not NULL before attempting to access its members. This would prevent a potential null pointer dereference. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST."  VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code calls gethostbyname without checking the length of the hostname. This allows for a potential buffer overflow
