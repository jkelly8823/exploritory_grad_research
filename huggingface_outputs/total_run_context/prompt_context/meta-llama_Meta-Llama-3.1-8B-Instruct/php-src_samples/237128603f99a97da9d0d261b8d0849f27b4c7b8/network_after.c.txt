 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function. This is because the code does not check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function. If the hostname is longer than MAXHOSTNAMELEN, it will cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function.
2. Use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as it is safer and more modern.
3. Use a safer function like gethostbyname_r to avoid buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST."
