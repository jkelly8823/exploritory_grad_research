 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-0235 vulnerability because it uses the gethostbyname function which is known to be vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. The gethostbyname function is deprecated and should not be used in new code. The code should be updated to use the getaddrinfo function instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname.
2. Remove the deprecated gethostbyname function from the code.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to gethostbyname, such as the gethostbyname2 function. However, this function is also deprecated and should be avoided if possible. 
4. Ensure that the code is compiled with the latest version of glibc to ensure that the vulnerability is patched.
