 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823 because it does not properly handle query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the query string. The vulnerability is present in lines 15-17 where the code checks if the decoded query string starts with a '-' and does not contain an '=' character. If this condition is met, the skip_getopt variable is set to 1, which causes the code to skip the getopt function. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as an attacker can still manipulate the query string to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a more robust check to ensure that the query string is properly formatted before passing it to the getopt function.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle query strings, such as using a library that can safely parse and validate query strings.
3. Ensure that the skip_getopt variable is properly reset to 0 after it is set to 1, to prevent it from affecting subsequent iterations of the while loop.
