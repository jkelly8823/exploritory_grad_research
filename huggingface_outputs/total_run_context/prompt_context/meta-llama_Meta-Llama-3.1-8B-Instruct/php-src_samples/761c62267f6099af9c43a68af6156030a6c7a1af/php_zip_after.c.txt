 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-170: NULL Pointer Dereference. This is because the function `zip_stat` is called with a NULL pointer as the second argument, which is the `file` variable. If `file` is NULL, this will cause a NULL pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if `file` is NULL before calling `zip_stat`.
2. If `file` is NULL, return an error or handle it accordingly.
3. Consider using a more robust way to handle file paths and avoid using NULL pointers.
