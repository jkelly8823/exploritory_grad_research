 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666. The code checks for safe mode restrictions and attempts to locate the file using the php_stream_locate_url_wrapper function, which is designed to handle URL-related issues. However, the code does not contain any directory traversal vulnerabilities or attempts to bypass safe mode restrictions using.. (dot dot) sequences.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to further enhance the security of the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2008-2665
