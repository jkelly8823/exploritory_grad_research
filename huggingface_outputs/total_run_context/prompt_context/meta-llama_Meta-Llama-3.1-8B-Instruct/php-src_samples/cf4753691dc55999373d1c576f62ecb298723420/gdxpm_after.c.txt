 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) due to the lack of error handling for the gdImageCreate function. If gdImageCreate fails, the code will attempt to access the 'im' pointer, which will be NULL, resulting in a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error handling for the gdImageCreate function to ensure that it returns a valid image pointer.
2. Check the return value of gdImageCreate before attempting to access the 'im' pointer. If it returns NULL, handle the error accordingly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-2497
CVE Description:
The gdImageCreateFromXpm function in gdxpm.c in libgd, as used in PHP 5.4.26 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted color table in an XPM file.  The vulnerability is due to the lack of bounds checking for the color table. The code does not check if the color table index is within the valid range before accessing the color
