 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-0191 because it loads an external DTD (dom.ent) which can be used to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted XML document. The xmlParserHandlePEReference function in libxml2 is used to load the external DTD, and it does not check whether entity substitution or validation is enabled. This allows an attacker to load an external DTD and cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable external entity loading by setting the libxml2 option 'LIBXML_NOENT' to true.
2. Validate the XML document before loading it to prevent loading of external entities.
3. Use a secure XML parser that does not have this vulnerability.
