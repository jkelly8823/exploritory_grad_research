 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11, 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds write or read due to the incorrect handling of octal numbers larger than 0xff in the fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc() functions. This can lead to memory corruption when a malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\700' is encountered.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input regular expression to prevent the use of octal numbers larger than 0xff.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the octal number is within the valid range before processing it.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to the scan_unsigned_octal_number() function, such as a function that uses a more secure parsing mechanism.
