 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds write or read due to the incorrect handling of octal numbers larger than 0xff in the next_state_val() function. The code does not properly validate the octal number, allowing an attacker to produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the octal number to ensure it does not exceed 0xff.
2. Use a safer method to handle octal numbers, such as using a library function that properly validates the input.
3. Consider using a more secure regular expression engine that is not vulnerable to this type of attack.

CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than
