 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-14107 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the EOCD records in the ZIP archive. The _zip_read_eocd64 function is not shown in this code snippet, but the vulnerability description suggests that it mishandles EOCD records. The code checks if the number of entries (nentry) is equal to the index (i), but it does not check if the EOCD record is valid. This can lead to a memory allocation failure in _zip_cdir_grow in zip_dirent.c.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the EOCD record is valid before processing it.
2. Use a secure function to read the EOCD record, such as _zip_read_eocd64.
3. Implement additional checks to ensure that the number of entries is valid.
