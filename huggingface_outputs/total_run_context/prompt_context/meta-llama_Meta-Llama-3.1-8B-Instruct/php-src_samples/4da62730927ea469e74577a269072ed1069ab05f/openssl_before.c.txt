 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack due to the improper handling of a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that properly handles '\0' characters in domain names.
2. Use a secure method to verify the certificate identity, such as using a trusted certificate authority or a secure certificate validation library. 
3. Consider using a secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or later, to encrypt the communication between the client and server. 
4. Regularly update and patch the OpenSSL library to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed. 5. Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as LibreSSL. 6. Implement a secure certificate validation process that checks for the presence of a '\0' character in the domain name. 7. Use a secure random number generator to generate the session ID. 8. Consider using a secure protocol, such as DTLS, to encrypt the communication between the client and server. 9
