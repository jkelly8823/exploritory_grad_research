 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of the do_translit function, which is not properly sanitized. This function is not a standard PHP function and its behavior is unknown, making it a potential entry point for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the do_translit function with a standard PHP function such as str_replace or preg_replace to ensure proper sanitization of user input.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Consider using a PHP framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection, such as Laravel or CodeIgniter. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-0831
CVE Description:
PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_main.c. 
Code Sample:
<?php
$var = $_GET['var'];
$query =
