 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. The code does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to version 5.3.10 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Disable magic_quotes_gpc and use alternative methods to sanitize user input.
