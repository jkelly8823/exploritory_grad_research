 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of the do_translit function, which is not properly sanitized. This function is not a standard PHP function and its behavior is not well-defined, making it a potential entry point for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The use of the do_translit function in this context is likely a mistake and should be replaced with a properly sanitized function, such as the built-in PHP function htmlspecialchars.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the do_translit function with the htmlspecialchars function to properly sanitize the input. For example:
```php
echo htmlspecialchars("Пеар");
``` VULNERABILITY LIST: ```php
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-0831
CVE Description:
PHP before 5.3.10 does not properly perform a temporary change to the magic_quotes_gpc directive during the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request, related to main/php_variables.c, sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c, and sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_main.c.
