 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.

However, it would be a good practice to add error handling to the code to ensure that it can handle any potential errors that may occur.  This could be done by wrapping the code in a try/catch block.  Additionally, it would be a good practice to validate any user input before using it in the code to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.  However, this is not related to the described CVE.  The code is secure and does not
