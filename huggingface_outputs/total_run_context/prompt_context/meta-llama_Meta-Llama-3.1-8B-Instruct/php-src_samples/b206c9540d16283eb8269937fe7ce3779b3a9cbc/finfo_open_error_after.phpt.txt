 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. This is a known issue in PHP versions prior to 5.3.10. The warning message indicates that the finfo::finfo() function is being passed a string instead of a long value, which is a symptom of this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade PHP to version 5.3.10 or later to fix this vulnerability. Alternatively, consider using a more secure alternative to finfo::finfo(), such as the fileinfo extension. Additionally, ensure that all user-input data is properly sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection attacks.
