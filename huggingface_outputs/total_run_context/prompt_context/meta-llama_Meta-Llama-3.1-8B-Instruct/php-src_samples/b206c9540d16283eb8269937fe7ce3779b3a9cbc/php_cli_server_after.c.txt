 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. The code does not properly sanitize user input, which makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Sanitize user input using a whitelist approach.
3. Disable magic_quotes_gpc and use a more secure way to handle user input.
