 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack out-of-bounds read due to the lack of validation of the 'widening' variable in the _ssa_##opN##_has_range function. This is similar to the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9224, where a logical error involving order of validation and access in match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add validation for the 'widening' variable to ensure it is within a valid range before accessing the stack buffer.
- Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the stack buffer to prevent out-of-bounds reads. 
- Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities related to stack buffer overflows.  ```python
