VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a potential vulnerability related to the use of a while loop with a conditional statement that may not be properly evaluated. This could potentially lead to an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the conditional statement to ensure it is properly evaluated and will not lead to an infinite loop.
2. Consider using a more robust loop construct, such as a for loop, to avoid potential issues with the while loop.
3. Ensure that the loop condition is properly checked and will not lead to unexpected behavior. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-9228
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in
