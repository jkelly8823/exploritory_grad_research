 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds write due to the use of alloca() function which can lead to a buffer overflow. The alloca() function is used to allocate memory on the stack, but it can lead to a buffer overflow if the allocated memory is not properly checked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the alloca() function with a safer alternative such as malloc() or a stack-based buffer.
2. Check the allocated memory size to prevent buffer overflow.
3. Use a memory sanitizer tool to detect memory-related bugs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-9228
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an
