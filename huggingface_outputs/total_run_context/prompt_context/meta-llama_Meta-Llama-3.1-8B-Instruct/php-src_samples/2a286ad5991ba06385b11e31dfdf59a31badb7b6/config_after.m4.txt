 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any direct references to the Oniguruma library or regular expression functionality, which is the primary target of the listed vulnerabilities. However, the code does include various Optimizer files, which may involve complex logic and potentially vulnerable code. Without further analysis or specific code inspection, it is difficult to determine if the listed vulnerabilities are present. It is recommended to review the Optimizer files and perform a thorough code inspection to identify any potential vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
