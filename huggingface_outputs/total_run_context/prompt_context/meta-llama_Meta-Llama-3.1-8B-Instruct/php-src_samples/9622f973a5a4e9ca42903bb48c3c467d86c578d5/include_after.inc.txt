 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the "httpoxy" issue because it does not properly sanitize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. The variable is used to set the 'Proxy' header in the request, which can be exploited by an attacker to redirect the application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE' key from the $params array, as it is not necessary for the request.
2. Use the 'http_proxy' key from the $headers array instead of the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable to set the 'Proxy' header.
3. Validate and sanitize all user input, including the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable, to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5385
CVE Description: 
PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via
