 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the "httpoxy" issue because it does not properly sanitize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. The line where the $params array is defined contains the 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE' key, which is not vulnerable, but the 'REQUEST_METHOD' key is not the issue here. The issue is that the code does not check if the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable is set and if so, it does not properly sanitize it. This can be exploited by an attacker to redirect the application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable is set before using it.
2. Sanitize the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable to prevent it from being used to redirect the application's outbound HTTP traffic.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable.
