 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any direct references to the `php_quot_print_encode` function, which is the specific function that the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability affects. However, the code does contain version checks for PHP, which could potentially be used to determine if the vulnerable version of PHP is installed. Nevertheless, the code itself does not contain any code that would trigger the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would trigger the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to keep the PHP version up to date to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure coding practice to avoid any potential vulnerabilities in the future.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other potential vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to use a static code analysis tool to identify any potential vulnerabilities in the code.
