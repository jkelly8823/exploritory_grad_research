 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function. This is due to the use of the zend_hash_copy function, which can lead to a buffer overflow when copying large amounts of data. The specific lines that are vulnerable are 24-26, where the zend_hash_copy function is called with a large amount of data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use a safer function such as zend_hash_update to update the hash table instead of copying it. Additionally, you can add bounds checking to ensure that the amount of data being copied is within a safe range. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
