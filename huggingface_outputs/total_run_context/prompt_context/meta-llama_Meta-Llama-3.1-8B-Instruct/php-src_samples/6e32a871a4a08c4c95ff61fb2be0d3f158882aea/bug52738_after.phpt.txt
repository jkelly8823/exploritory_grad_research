 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any direct references to the php_quot_print_encode function, which is the specific function vulnerable to the heap-based buffer overflow. However, the code does contain an array with various settings for date formatting, which could potentially be used in a function that calls php_quot_print_encode. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is impossible to determine if this code is actually vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the surrounding code to determine if the provided array is being used in a function that calls php_quot_print_encode.
2. If the array is being used in a function that calls php_quot_print_encode, consider upgrading to a version of PHP that is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-2110 (PHP 5.3.26 or later, or PHP 5.4.16 or later).
3. If upgrading is not possible, consider using a secure alternative to the php_quot_print_encode function, such as a custom implementation or a third-party library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
