VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the php_quot_print_encode function. The code is using the format method of a DateInterval object, which does not involve the quoted_printable_encode function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is safe from this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep your PHP version up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Consider upgrading to PHP 5.3.26 or later, or PHP 5.4.16 or later.  Also, ensure that any user-supplied input is properly sanitized to prevent other potential vulnerabilities.  Consider using a PHP framework or library that provides input validation and sanitization features.  Additionally, consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in your code.  Finally, consider implementing a code review process to ensure that your code is secure and follows best practices.  This will help prevent other potential vulnerabilities and ensure the security of your application.  Consider using a code review tool to help identify potential issues.  Also, consider implementing a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
