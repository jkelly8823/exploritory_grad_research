 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. The code is using the date_diff function to calculate the difference between two dates, which is a built-in PHP function and does not involve any user-supplied input that could be used to overflow a buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is safe and does not require any modifications. However, it is always a good practice to validate user input and ensure that it conforms to the expected format to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
