 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function due to the use of the pg_convert function. The pg_convert function is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data that can cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to version 5.3.26 or later, or version 5.4.16 or later.
2. Use a secure alternative to pg_convert, such as pg_escape_string.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into the database. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-6708
CVE Description:
The PHP 5.4.0 and 5.4.1 CGI executable in PHP before 5.4.2 does not properly handle a certain error condition, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted script that leverages a race condition between the creation of a temporary file and the execution of a system call.

Code Sample:
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
$pid = pcntl_fork();
if ($pid == -1) {
