 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of the pg_update function with user-supplied input. The $fields and $ids arrays contain user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized, which can lead to a buffer overflow when the pg_update function attempts to process the data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize the user-supplied input before passing it to the pg_update function. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the input data and ensuring that it conforms to the expected format. Additionally, the use of prepared statements or parameterized queries can help prevent SQL injection attacks and reduce the risk of buffer overflows. For example, the code can be modified as follows:
```php
include 'config.inc';

$db = pg_connect($conn_str);
$fields = array('num'=>'1234','str'=>'ABC', 'bin'=>'XYZ');
$ids = array('num'=>'1234');

// Sanitize the input data using a whitelist approach
$fields = array_map(function($key, $value) {
    if (in_array($key, array('num', '
