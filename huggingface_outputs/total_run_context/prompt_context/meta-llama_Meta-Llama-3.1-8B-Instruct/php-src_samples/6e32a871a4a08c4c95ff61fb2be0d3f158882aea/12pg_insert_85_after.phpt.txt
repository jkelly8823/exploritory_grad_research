 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample is written in PHP, but it does not use the quoted_printable_encode function. Instead, it uses the pg_insert function to insert data into a PostgreSQL database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to validate user input and ensure that data is properly sanitized before inserting it into a database to prevent other types of vulnerabilities.
