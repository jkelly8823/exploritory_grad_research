 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVE-2013-2110. The code is using PHP's built-in DateInterval class, which is not related to the php_quot_print_encode function mentioned in the CVE description. The code is also not passing any user-controlled input to the DateInterval constructor, which reduces the risk of a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. In this case, since the code is not passing any user-controlled input to the DateInterval constructor, this is not necessary. But in general, it is a good practice to validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.  ```php
