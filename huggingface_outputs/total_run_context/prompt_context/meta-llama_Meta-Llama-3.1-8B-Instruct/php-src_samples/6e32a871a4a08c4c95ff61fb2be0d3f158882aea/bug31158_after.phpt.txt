VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function, which is not present in the provided code sample. The code sample appears to be testing a different issue, Bug #31158, which is related to array_splice on $GLOBALS crashing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the vulnerable function or code that would trigger the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability. However, the code sample does contain a function that is being tested for a different issue, and it may be worth reviewing the code to ensure it is not introducing any other vulnerabilities.  The code sample should be reviewed for any potential issues related to the Bug #31158.  It may be worth considering adding error handling or other defensive programming techniques to prevent crashes.  Additionally, the code sample uses the error_reporting = E_ALL directive, which may be useful for debugging but could potentially reveal sensitive information about the application.  Consider using a more secure error reporting level, such as error_reporting = E_ERROR.  Finally, the code
