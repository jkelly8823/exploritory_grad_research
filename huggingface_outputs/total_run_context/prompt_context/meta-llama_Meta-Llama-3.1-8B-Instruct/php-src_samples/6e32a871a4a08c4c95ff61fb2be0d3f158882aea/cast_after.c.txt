 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function in ext/standard/quot_print.c. This is due to the fact that the php_stream_write function is called with a buffer that is not properly checked for its size, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the size of the buffer before calling php_stream_write to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use a safer function to write to the stream, such as php_stream_write_ex, which allows for more control over the write operation.
3. Consider using a more secure function, such as php_stream_write_ex, which allows for more control over the write operation and can help prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2110
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function in ext/standard/quot_print.c in PHP before 5.3.26 and 5.4.x before 5.4.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
