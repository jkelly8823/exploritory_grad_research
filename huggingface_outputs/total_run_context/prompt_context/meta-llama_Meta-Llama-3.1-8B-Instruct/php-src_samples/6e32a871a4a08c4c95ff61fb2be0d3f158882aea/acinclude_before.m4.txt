 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that directly relates to the CVE-2013-2110 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the php_quot_print_encode function in the PHP standard library, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a snippet from the Zend Engine build process, which is a part of the PHP project, but it does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this specific issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is worth noting that the code sample is using a hardcoded list of supported bison versions, which may not be the most maintainable or scalable approach. Consider using a more dynamic method to determine supported versions.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
