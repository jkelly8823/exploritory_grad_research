 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of the pg_escape_bytea function. This function escapes the input data but does not perform any bounds checking, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data that can cause a buffer overflow when unescaped. The pg_unescape_bytea function is then used to unescape the data, which can lead to a denial of service or other unspecified impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to escape the input data, such as using a prepared statement or a library that performs bounds checking.
2. Validate the input data to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters.
3. Consider using a more secure database driver that does not rely on the pg_escape_bytea function. 
4. Use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the query. 
5. Consider using a more secure way to store and retrieve the image data, such as using a binary data type or a separate table for storing images.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2110  CVE Description: Heap-based buffer overflow in the php
