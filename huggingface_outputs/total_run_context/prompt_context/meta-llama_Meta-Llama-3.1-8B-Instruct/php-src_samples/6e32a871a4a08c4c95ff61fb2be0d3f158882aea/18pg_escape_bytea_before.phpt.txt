 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of the pg_escape_bytea function. This function escapes special characters in the input string, but it does not prevent the input string from being too long. If the input string is too long, it can cause a buffer overflow when it is stored in the database. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to store binary data in the database, such as using a blob or varbinary data type.
2. Use a function that prevents buffer overflows, such as pg_escape_bytea with the PG_BYTEA_ESCAPE_SLASH option.
3. Validate the length of the input string to prevent it from being too long. 
4. Consider using a more secure database library, such as PDO.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2110  CVE Description: Heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function in ext/standard/quot_print.c in PHP before 5.3.26 and 5.4.x before 5
