 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function in ext/standard/quot_print.c in PHP before 5.3.26 and 5.4.x before 5.4.16. This is due to the use of a crafted argument to the quoted_printable_encode function, which can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. The vulnerability is present in the line where the DatePeriod object is created and the line where the unserialized DatePeriod object is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to version 5.3.26 or later, or version 5.4.16 or later.
2. Avoid using unserialized DatePeriod instances.
3. Use a secure coding practice to prevent buffer overflows, such as using a safe function to encode the data. 
4. Use a secure coding practice to prevent denial of service attacks, such as using a try-catch block to catch and handle exceptions. 
5. Use a secure coding practice to prevent unspecified other impacts, such as using a secure function to format the date.  V
