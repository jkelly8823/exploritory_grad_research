 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any PHP code, and therefore does not contain the vulnerable function php_quot_print_encode. The vulnerability is specific to PHP versions prior to 5.3.26 and 5.4.x prior to 5.4.16, and the code sample does not appear to be written in PHP.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any PHP code, and therefore does not require any fixes. However, if the code is intended to be written in PHP, it is recommended to use a version of PHP that is not vulnerable to this issue. Additionally, it is recommended to use a PHP framework or library that provides input validation and sanitization to prevent other types of vulnerabilities.
