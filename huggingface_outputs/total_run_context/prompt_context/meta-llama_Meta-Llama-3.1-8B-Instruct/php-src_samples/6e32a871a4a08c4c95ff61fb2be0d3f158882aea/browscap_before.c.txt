 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function due to the use of the zend_hash_copy function, which can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted argument to the quoted_printable_encode function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to version 5.3.26 or later, or version 5.4.16 or later.
2. Use a secure alternative to zend_hash_copy, such as zend_hash_update or zend_hash_add.
3. Validate user input to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
