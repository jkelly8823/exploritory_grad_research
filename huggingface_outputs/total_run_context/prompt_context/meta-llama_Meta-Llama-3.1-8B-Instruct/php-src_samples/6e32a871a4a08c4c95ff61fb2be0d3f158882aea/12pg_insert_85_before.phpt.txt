 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function. The function in question is not being used in this code sample. The code is using the pg_insert function to insert data into a PostgreSQL database, which does not involve the quoted_printable_encode function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to validate user input and ensure that the data being inserted into the database is properly sanitized to prevent other types of vulnerabilities.  The use of prepared statements can also help prevent SQL injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0160
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL DSA signature algorithm is vulnerable to a timing attack, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain the private key.
