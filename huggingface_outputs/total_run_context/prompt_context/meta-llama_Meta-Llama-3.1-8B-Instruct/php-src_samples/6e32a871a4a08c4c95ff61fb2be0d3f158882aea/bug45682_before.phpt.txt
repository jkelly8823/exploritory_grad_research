 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. The code is using the date_diff function to calculate the difference between two dates, which is a built-in PHP function and does not involve any user input or external data that could be used to cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is safe and does not require any modifications. However, it is always a good practice to validate user input and ensure that any external data is properly sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2110, CVE_Description:Heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function in ext/standard/quot_print.c in PHP before 5.3.26 and 5.4.x before 5.4.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted argument to the quoted_printable_encode function.
