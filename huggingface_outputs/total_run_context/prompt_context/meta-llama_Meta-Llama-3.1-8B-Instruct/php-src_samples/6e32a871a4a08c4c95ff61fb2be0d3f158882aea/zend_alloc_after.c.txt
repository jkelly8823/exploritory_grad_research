 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of inline assembly. The `mull` and `mulq` instructions are used to multiply the `res` variable by the `size` variable, but the result is not checked for overflow. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the product of `res` and `size` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the `res` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to perform the multiplication, such as using the `*` operator or a library function.
2. Check the result of the multiplication for overflow before assigning it to the `res` variable.
3. Consider using a larger data type, such as `uint64_t`, to represent the result of the multiplication.
