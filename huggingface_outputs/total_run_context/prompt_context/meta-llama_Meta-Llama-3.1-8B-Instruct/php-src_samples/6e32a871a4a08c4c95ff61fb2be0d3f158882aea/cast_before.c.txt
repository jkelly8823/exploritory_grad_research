 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function. This is due to the fact that the php_stream_write function is not properly validating the size of the buffer being written, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size of the buffer being written to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
2. Use a safer function, such as php_stream_write_ex, which provides additional security features to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the php_quot_print_encode function, such as a function that uses a safer encoding scheme. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2110
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the php_quot_print_encode function in ext/standard/quot_print.c in PHP before 5.3.26 and 5.4.x before 5.4.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted argument to the quoted_printable_encode function.
