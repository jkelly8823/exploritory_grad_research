 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential exception that may be thrown when trying to access the line number of an exception object. This is because the code does not check if the exception object has a 'getLine' method before calling it. If the exception object does not have this method, it will result in a fatal error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the exception object has a 'getLine' method before calling it.
2. Use a try-catch block to catch any potential exceptions that may be thrown when trying to access the line number of the exception object.
