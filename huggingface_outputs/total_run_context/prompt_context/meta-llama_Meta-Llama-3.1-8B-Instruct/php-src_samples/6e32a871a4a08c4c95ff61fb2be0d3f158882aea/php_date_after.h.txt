 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any instances of the php_quot_print_encode function, which is the specific function vulnerable to the heap-based buffer overflow. The code appears to be related to date and time functions in PHP, and does not seem to be related to the quoted_printable_encode function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any instances of the vulnerable function, so no fixes are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep your PHP version up to date, as newer versions may have patches for this vulnerability. Consider upgrading to PHP 5.3.26 or later, or PHP 5.4.16 or later.  ```bash
composer require phpunit/phpunit
``` 
to ensure you have the latest dependencies. 
```php
composer update
``` 
to update your dependencies. 
```php
php -v
``` 
to check your PHP version. 
```php
php -m
``` 
to check your installed PHP modules. 
```php
php -i
``` 
to check your PHP configuration. 
```php
php -r 'echo PHP_VERSION;'
```
