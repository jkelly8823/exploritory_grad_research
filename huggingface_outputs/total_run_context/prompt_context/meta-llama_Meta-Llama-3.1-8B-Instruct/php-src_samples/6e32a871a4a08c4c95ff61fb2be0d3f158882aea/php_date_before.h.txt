 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains a function call to date_interval_create_from_date_string, which is a function that is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. This function is known to be vulnerable to CVE-2013-2110, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted argument to the quoted_printable_encode function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update PHP to version 5.3.26 or later, or version 5.4.16 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Avoid using the date_interval_create_from_date_string function with untrusted input.
- Consider using a safer alternative to the quoted_printable_encode function.  ```bash
