 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is a known vulnerability in the SSL protocol that allows an attacker to obtain plaintext HTTP headers. The code is using the SSL_OP_ALL option, which enables CBC mode, and the OpenSSL version is 0.9.8o, which is affected by this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of OpenSSL that is not affected by the BEAST attack, such as 1.0.0 or later.
2. Use the SSL_OP_NO_BEAST option to disable CBC mode and prevent the BEAST attack.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2, which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack.

CVE_ID:CVE-2011-3389
CVE Description:
The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a block
