 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17, 24, 31
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is evident in the lines where SSL_CTX_set_options is called with the ssl_ctx_options variable. The ssl_ctx_options variable is set to include SSL_OP_ALL, which enables CBC mode. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option, which is necessary to prevent the BEAST attack. The lines where SSL_new is called also indicate that the code is vulnerable, as it does not properly handle the creation of the SSL handle.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or later, which uses GCM mode and is resistant to the BEAST attack.
2. Set the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option to prevent the BEAST attack.
3. Properly handle the creation of the SSL handle by checking for errors and handling them accordingly.
