 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is a known vulnerability in the SSL protocol that can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain plaintext HTTP headers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.1 or 1.2, which use a more secure mode of operation.
2. Use the SSL_OP_NO_BEAST option to disable the BEAST attack.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as TLS 1.3, which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-3389
CVE Description:
The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2
