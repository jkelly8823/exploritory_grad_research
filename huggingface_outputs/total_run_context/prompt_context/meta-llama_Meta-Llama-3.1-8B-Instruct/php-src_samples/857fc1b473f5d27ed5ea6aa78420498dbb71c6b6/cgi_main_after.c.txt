 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823 because it does not properly handle query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the query string.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the query string contains an equals sign before processing it.
2. Use a more secure method to parse the query string, such as using a library like libcurl.
3. Validate user input to prevent command-line options from being injected into the query string. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-1823
CVE Description:
sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, when configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the query string, related to lack of skipping a certain php_getopt for the 'd' case.
