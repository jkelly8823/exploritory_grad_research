 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823 because it does not properly handle query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the query string. The vulnerability is present in the while loop where the php_getopt function is called. The php_getopt function is not properly skipping the 'd' case, which allows the execution of arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the php_getopt function to properly skip the 'd' case.
2. Validate the query string to ensure it contains an = (equals sign) character before passing it to the php_getopt function.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle command-line options, such as using a whitelist of allowed options.  ```c
while ((c = php_getopt(argc, argv, OPTIONS, &php_optarg, &php_optind, 0, 2))!= -1) {
	switch (c) {
		case 'c':
			if (cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override) {
				free(cgi_sapi_module.php_ini_path_override);
