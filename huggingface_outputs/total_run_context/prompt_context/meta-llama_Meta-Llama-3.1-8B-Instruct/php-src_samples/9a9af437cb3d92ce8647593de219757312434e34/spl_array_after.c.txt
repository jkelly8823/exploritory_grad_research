 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file that triggers a large amount of backtracking. This is due to the use of multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions in the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands in file before 5.15.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands to use a more efficient regular expression that does not allow unlimited repetitions.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of backtracking attempts in the awk script detector.
3. Consider using a more robust regular expression engine that can handle large amounts of backtracking more efficiently. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-7345
CVE Description:
The BEGIN regular expression in the awk script detector in magic/Magdir/commands in file before 5.15 uses multiple wildcards with unlimited repetitions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file that triggers a large amount of backtracking, as demonstrated via a file with many newline characters.
