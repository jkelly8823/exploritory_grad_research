 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory allocation failure) due to the mishandling of EOCD records. This is because the code does not properly check for the end of the EOCD record, leading to a potential memory allocation failure in _zip_cdir_grow in zip_dirent.c. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the code checks for the offset and size of the EOCD record, and sets the error accordingly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly check for the end of the EOCD record by verifying that the offset and size do not exceed the buffer offset and EOCD offset.
2. Use a more robust error handling mechanism to prevent memory allocation failures.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a linked list, to store the directory entries. This would prevent the memory allocation failure in _zip_cdir_grow in zip_dirent.c. 4. Update the code to handle the case where the EOCD record is corrupted or incomplete. 5. Consider adding additional checks to prevent the code from accessing memory outside the bounds of the buffer. 6. Use a secure
