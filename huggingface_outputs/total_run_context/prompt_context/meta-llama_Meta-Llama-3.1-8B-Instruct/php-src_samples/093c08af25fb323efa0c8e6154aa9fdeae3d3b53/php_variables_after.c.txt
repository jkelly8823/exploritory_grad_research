EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-31629. This vulnerability allows an attacker to set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which is treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications. The vulnerability is present in the `php_register_variable_ex` function where it checks for forbidden variable names using the `php_is_forbidden_variable_name` function. However, the function does not properly handle the case where the mangled name starts with `__Host-` or `__Secure-` but the pre-mangled name does not. This allows an attacker to set a cookie that is treated as secure but is not.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2022-31629 (PHP 7.4.31, 8.0.24, or 8.1.11 or later).
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the mangled name starts with `__Host-` or `__Secure-` and the pre-mangled name does not.
