 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-31629 because it does not properly handle the mangling of variable names. The code checks if the variable name starts with "__Host-" or "__Secure-" after mangling, but it does not check if the original variable name started with these prefixes. This allows an attacker to set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which is treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the original variable name before mangling to ensure it does not start with "__Host-" or "__Secure-".
2. Use a more secure method to handle variable names, such as using a whitelist of allowed prefixes.
3. Update PHP to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches.
