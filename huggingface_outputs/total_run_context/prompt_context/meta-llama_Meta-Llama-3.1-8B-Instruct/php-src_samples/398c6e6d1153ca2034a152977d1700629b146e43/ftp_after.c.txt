 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17, 24, 31
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is evident in the lines where SSL_CTX_set_options is called with the ssl_ctx_options variable. The ssl_ctx_options variable is set to include SSL_OP_ALL, which enables CBC mode. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option, which is necessary to prevent the BEAST attack. The lines where the SSL_CTX_set_options function is called are vulnerable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a secure cipher suite that is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack. This can be done by setting the cipher suite using the SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list function.
2. Properly handle the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option by setting it to 1. This can be done by adding the line ssl_ctx_options |= SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS; before calling SSL_CTX_set_options.
3. Consider using a secure protocol such as TLS 1.2 or later, which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack.
