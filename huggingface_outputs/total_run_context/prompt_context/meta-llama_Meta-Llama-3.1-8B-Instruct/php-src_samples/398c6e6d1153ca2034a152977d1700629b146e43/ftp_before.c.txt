 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17, 24, 31
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the BEAST attack due to the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors. This is evident in the lines where SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_ALL) is called, which enables the SSL_OP_ALL option. This option enables the use of CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, making the code vulnerable to the BEAST attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a secure protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or later, which uses the AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphersuites. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a secure cipher suite, such as AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. The SSL_OP_ALL option should be removed, and the code should be modified to use a secure protocol and cipher suite.
