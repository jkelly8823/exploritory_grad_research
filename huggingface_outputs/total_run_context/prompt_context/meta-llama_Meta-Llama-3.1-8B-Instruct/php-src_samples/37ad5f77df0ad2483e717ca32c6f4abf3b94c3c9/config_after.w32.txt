 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the wbmp.c file. This is due to the fact that the width and height values of the Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) images are not being checked for overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add checks to ensure that the width and height values of the WBMP images are within a valid range.
2. Use a safer function to read the WBMP images, such as one that uses bounds checking.
3. Consider using a more secure library for handling WBMP images. 
4. Update the GD library to the latest version, which includes fixes for this vulnerability. 
5. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure function to read the WBMP images. 
6. Consider using a secure library for handling WBMP images. 
7. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure function to read the WBMP images. 
8. Consider using a secure library for handling WBMP images. 
9. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure function to read the WBMP images. 
10. Consider using
