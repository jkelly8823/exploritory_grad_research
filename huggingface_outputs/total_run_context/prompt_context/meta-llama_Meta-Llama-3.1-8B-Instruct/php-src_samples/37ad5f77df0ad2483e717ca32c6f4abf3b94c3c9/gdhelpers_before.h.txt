 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the gdPFree and gdPEstrdup macros. The pefree and pestrdup functions are not checked for integer overflows, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a critical vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use safer functions that check for integer overflows, such as _pefree_s and _pestrdup_s.
2. Add input validation to ensure that the width and height values are within a safe range.
3. Consider using a safer library that is not vulnerable to integer overflows. 
4. Update the library to the latest version to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```python
def detect_vulnerability(code, vulnerability_list):
    # Parse the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
    tree = ast.parse(code)

    # Iterate over the vulnerability list
    for vulnerability in vulnerability_list:
        cve_id = vulnerability['CVE_ID']
        cve_description = vulnerability['CVE_Description']

        # Check if the vulnerability is related to integer overflows
        if 'integer overflow'
