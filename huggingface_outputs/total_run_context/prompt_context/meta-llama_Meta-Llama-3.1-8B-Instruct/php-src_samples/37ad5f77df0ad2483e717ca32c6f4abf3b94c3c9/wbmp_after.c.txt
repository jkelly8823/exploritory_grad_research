 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 11, 14, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the createwbmp function. The overflow2 function is used to check for overflows, but it is not used consistently throughout the code. In lines 5, 7, 11, and 14, the overflow2 function is used to check for overflows, but in lines 17 and 20, it is not used. This inconsistency makes the code vulnerable to integer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the overflow2 function consistently throughout the code to check for overflows.
2. Consider using a more robust method to check for overflows, such as using a library that provides overflow checking.
3. Consider using a safer allocation function, such as safe_malloc, instead of gdMalloc. 
4. Consider using a safer memory management function, such as safe_free, instead of gdFree. 
5. Consider using a more secure way to handle errors, such as using a try-catch block instead of returning NULL or -1.  VULNERABLE: YES
