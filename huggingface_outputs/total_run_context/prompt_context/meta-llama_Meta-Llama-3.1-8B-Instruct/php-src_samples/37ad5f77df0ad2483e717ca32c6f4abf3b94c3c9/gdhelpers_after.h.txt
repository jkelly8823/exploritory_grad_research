 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the gdPFree and gdPEstrdup macros. The overflow2 function is used to check for integer overflows, but it is not used in the macros. The gdPFree and gdPEstrdup macros directly call pefree and pestrdup functions, which can lead to integer overflows if the input values are large.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the overflow2 function to check for integer overflows in the gdPFree and gdPEstrdup macros.
2. Modify the gdPFree and gdPEstrdup macros to use the overflow2 function to check for integer overflows before calling pefree and pestrdup functions.
3. Consider using safer functions that do not have integer overflow vulnerabilities, such as malloc and free. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
