 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to integer overflows in the wbmp.c file. The code snippet appears to be a part of a configure script, checking for the presence of certain functions (fabsf and floorf) that are available since C99. There is no indication of any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the configure script is properly maintained and updated to reflect any changes in the C99 standard or the availability of certain functions. This can be achieved by regularly reviewing the script and updating it as necessary. Additionally, it is recommended to use secure coding practices when writing code that may be vulnerable to integer overflows. This can include using safe functions, checking for buffer overflows, and using secure data types.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
