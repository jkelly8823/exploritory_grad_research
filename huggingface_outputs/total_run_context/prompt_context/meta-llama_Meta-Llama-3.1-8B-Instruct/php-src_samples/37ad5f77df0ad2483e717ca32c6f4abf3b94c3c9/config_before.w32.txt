 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the createwbmp and readwbmp functions in wbmp.c. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly check for large width or height values in Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) images. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation to check for large width and height values in WBMP images.
2. Use a safer data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store width and height values.
3. Consider using a library that provides secure image processing functions. 
4. Update the GD library to the latest version, which includes fixes for this vulnerability. 
5. Consider using a secure alternative to the GD library, such as ImageMagick.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
