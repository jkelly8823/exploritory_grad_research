 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073, a man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability. This is due to the lack of proper handling of a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability is present in the openssl_x509v3_subjectAltName function, specifically in the line where the GENERAL_NAMES structure is being populated from the ASN1_item_d2i function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073.
2. Implement a custom function to handle the Subject Alternative Name field, ensuring that it properly handles '\0' characters.
3. Use a secure method to parse the X.509 certificate, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.
