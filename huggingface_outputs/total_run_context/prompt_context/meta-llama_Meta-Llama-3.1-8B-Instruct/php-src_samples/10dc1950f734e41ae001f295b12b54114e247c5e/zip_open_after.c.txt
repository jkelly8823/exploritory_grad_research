 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory allocation failure) due to mishandling of EOCD records. This is because the code does not properly check for the end of the EOCD record, leading to potential memory allocation failures. The code checks for inconsistencies in the EOCD record, but it does not check for the end of the record, which can lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for the end of the EOCD record before attempting to access it.
2. Use a more robust method to handle memory allocation failures, such as using a try-catch block or a more efficient memory allocation algorithm.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle inconsistencies in the EOCD record, such as using a checksum or a more robust validation method.  ```c
int _zip_read_eocd64(struct zip_source *source, struct zip_error *error, zip_uint64_t *offset, zip_uint64_t *size, zip_uint64_t *buf_offset, zip_uint64_t *eocd_offset, zip_uint32_t flags) {
    if (offset+size > buf_offset
