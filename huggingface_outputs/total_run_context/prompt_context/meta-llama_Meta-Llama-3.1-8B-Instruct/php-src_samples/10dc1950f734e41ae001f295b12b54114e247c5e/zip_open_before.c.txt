 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-14107 vulnerability. The _zip_read_eocd64 function is not properly handling EOCD records, which can lead to a denial of service. The code checks for inconsistencies in the ZIP archive, but it does not properly handle the case where the EOCD record is not correctly located. This can cause a memory allocation failure in the _zip_cdir_grow function in zip_dirent.c.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the libzip library to version 1.3.0 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the EOCD record is correctly located before proceeding with the ZIP archive processing.
3. Consider using a more robust ZIP archive parsing library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```
