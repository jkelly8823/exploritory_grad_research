 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the wbmp.c file. This is due to the fact that the width and height values of the Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) images are not being checked for overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add checks to ensure that the width and height values of the WBMP images are within a valid range.
2. Use a safer data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the width and height values.
3. Consider using a library that provides secure image processing functions. 
4. Update the GD library to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
5. Use a secure coding practice, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent integer overflows. 
6. Consider using a secure alternative to the GD library, such as ImageMagick. 
7. Use a static analysis tool to identify and fix potential integer overflows in the code. 
8. Consider using a code review process to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 
9. Use a secure coding standard, such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices, to
