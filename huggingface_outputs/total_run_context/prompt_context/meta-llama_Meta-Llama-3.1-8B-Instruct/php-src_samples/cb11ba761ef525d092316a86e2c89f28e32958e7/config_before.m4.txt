 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to integer overflows in the createwbmp and readwbmp functions. The code snippet appears to be a part of a configure script, which is used to check for the presence of certain functions (fabsf and floorf) that are available since C99. The code does not contain any code that handles WBMP images or performs any operations that could lead to integer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the configure script is properly maintained and updated to handle any future changes in the GD library or other dependencies. Additionally, it is recommended to perform regular security audits and testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
