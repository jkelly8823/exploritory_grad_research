 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 11, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the createwbmp function. The overflow2 function is used to check for overflows, but it is not used consistently throughout the code. In lines 5, 7, 11, and 15, the overflow2 function is not used to check for overflows when allocating memory for the wbmp structure and its bitmap. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the overflow2 function consistently throughout the code to check for overflows when allocating memory.
2. Consider using a safer memory allocation function, such as safe_malloc, to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Review the code to ensure that all potential integer overflows are checked and handled properly.
