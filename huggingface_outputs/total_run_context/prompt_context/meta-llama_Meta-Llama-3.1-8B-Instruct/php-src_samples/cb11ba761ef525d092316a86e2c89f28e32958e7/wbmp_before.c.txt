 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5,7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the createwbmp and readwbmp functions. The issue arises when the width and height values are used to allocate memory for the bitmap. If these values are large enough, they can cause an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the width and height values to ensure they are within a safe range before using them to allocate memory.
2. Consider using a safer memory allocation function that can handle large values, such as a function that allocates memory in chunks.
3. Use a secure coding practice, such as bounds checking, to prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2007-1001
CVE Description:
Multiple integer overflows in the (1) createwbmp and (2) readwbmp functions in wbmp.c in the GD library (libgd) in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via Wireless Bitmap
