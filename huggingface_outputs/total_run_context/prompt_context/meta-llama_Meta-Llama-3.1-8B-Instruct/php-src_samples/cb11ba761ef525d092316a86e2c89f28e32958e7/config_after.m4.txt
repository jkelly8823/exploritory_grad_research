 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to integer overflows in the wbmp.c file. The code snippet appears to be a part of a configure script, checking for the presence of certain functions (fabsf and floorf) that are available since C99. There is no indication of any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any code that interacts with external libraries or functions is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities. In this case, the code is simply checking for the presence of certain functions, and does not appear to be interacting with any external libraries or functions that could be vulnerable to the described issue.
