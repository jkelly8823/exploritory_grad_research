 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the wbmp.c file. This is due to the fact that the width and height values of the Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) images are not being checked for overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add checks to ensure that the width and height values of the WBMP images are within a valid range.
2. Use a safer data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the width and height values.
3. Consider using a library that provides secure image processing functions. 
4. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities. 
5. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities. 6. Consider using a code review process to identify potential vulnerabilities. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard to ensure that the code is written securely. 8. Consider using a secure coding guide to ensure that the code is written securely. 9. Consider using a secure coding checklist to ensure that the code is written securely. 10. Consider using a secure coding framework to ensure that the code is written securely. 11.
