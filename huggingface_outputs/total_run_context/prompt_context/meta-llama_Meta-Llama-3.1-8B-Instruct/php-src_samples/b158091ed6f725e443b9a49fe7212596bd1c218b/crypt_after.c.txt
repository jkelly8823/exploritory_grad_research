 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2011-2483 because it does not properly handle 8-bit characters in the password hash. The condition `salt[2]!= 'a' && salt[2]!= 'x'` is a workaround for the vulnerability, but it is not a secure fix. The correct fix would be to use a secure password hashing algorithm that can handle 8-bit characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. Avoid using workarounds like the one in the code. Instead, use a secure algorithm that can handle 8-bit characters and is resistant to timing attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-2483
CVE Description:
crypt_blowfish before 1.1, as used in PHP before 5.3.7 on certain platforms, PostgreSQL before 8.4.9, and other products, does not properly handle 8-bit characters, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to determine a cleartext password by leveraging knowledge of a password hash.
