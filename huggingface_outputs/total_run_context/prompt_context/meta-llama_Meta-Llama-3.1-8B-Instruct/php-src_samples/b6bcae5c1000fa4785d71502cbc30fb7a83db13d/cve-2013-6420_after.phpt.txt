 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2013-6420. This vulnerability occurs when the openssl_x509_parse function is called with a crafted X.509 certificate that contains an illegal ASN1 data type for a timestamp. The function does not properly handle this type of data, leading to a denial of service (memory corruption) or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update PHP to version 5.3.28 or later, 5.4.23 or later, or 5.5.7 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2. Use a secure method to parse X.509 certificates, such as the OpenSSL library's X509_parse function.
3. Validate user-supplied input to prevent the use of crafted certificates. 
4. Consider using a more secure alternative to the openssl_x509_parse function, such as the OpenSSL library's X509_parse function. 
5. Regularly update and patch your PHP installation to ensure you have the latest security fixes.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
