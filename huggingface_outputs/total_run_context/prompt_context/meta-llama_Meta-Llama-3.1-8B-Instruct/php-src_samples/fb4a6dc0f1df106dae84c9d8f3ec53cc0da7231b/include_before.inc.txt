 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the "httpoxy" issue because it does not properly sanitize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. The variable is not checked for validity before being used in the request. This allows an attacker to manipulate the proxy server used by the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE' key from the $params array, as it is not necessary for the request.
2. Add a check to ensure that the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable is not set before using it in the request.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the proxy server, such as using a configuration file or a secure proxy server. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5385
CVE Description: 
PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (
