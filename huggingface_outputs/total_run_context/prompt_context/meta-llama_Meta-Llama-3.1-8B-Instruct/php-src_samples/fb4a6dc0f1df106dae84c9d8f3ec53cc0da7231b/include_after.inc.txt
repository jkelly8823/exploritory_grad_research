 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the "httpoxy" issue because it does not properly sanitize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. The variable is not checked for validity before being used in the request. This allows an attacker to manipulate the proxy server used by the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable from the $params array.
2. Use a whitelist approach to validate the 'HTTP_PROXY' environment variable before using it in the request.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle outbound HTTP requests, such as using a library that properly handles proxy settings.
