 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that could be exploited by a session fixation vulnerability. The code is using PostgreSQL and performing queries to set client min messages and select a test notice function. The session fixation vulnerability is typically associated with web applications and PHP sessions, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that the database connection and queries are properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential SQL injection attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The code sample does not contain any PHP code, so this vulnerability is not applicable.  The code sample is using PostgreSQL and PHP is not being used in this context.  Therefore, this vulnerability is not present in the code sample.  The code sample is using PostgreSQL and performing queries to set client min messages and select a test notice function.
