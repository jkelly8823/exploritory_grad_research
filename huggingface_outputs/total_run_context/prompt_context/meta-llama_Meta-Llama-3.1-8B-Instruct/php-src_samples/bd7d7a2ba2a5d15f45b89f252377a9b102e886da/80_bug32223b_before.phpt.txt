 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to session fixation due to the use of the pg_query function, which does not properly handle session fixation. The pg_query function is used to execute a SQL query, but it does not take into account the session ID, which can be exploited by an attacker to hijack the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use the pg_query_params function instead of pg_query, which allows you to pass parameters to the SQL query and helps prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, you should ensure that the session ID is properly validated and regenerated on each request to prevent session fixation. You can use the session_regenerate_id function to regenerate the session ID. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
```php
<?php
// Create a new PostgreSQL database connection
$dbh = pg_connect("host=localhost dbname=mydb user=myuser password=mypassword");

// Execute a SQL query to create a new table
pg_query($dbh, "CREATE TABLE test (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255))");

// Execute a SQL query to insert a new row into the table
pg_query($dbh, "INSERT INTO test
