 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the use of the pg_query function without proper error handling. The function does not check if the query was executed successfully, which allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use pg_query_params instead of pg_query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Check the return value of pg_query to ensure that the query was executed successfully.
3. Use a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during query execution. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
```php
<?php
// test.php
// This is a test file for the PHP session fixation vulnerability.
// It is assumed that the PHP session is not properly configured.

// Create a new session
session_start();

// Set the session ID
$_SESSION['id'] = '1234567890';

// Close the session
session_write_close();

// Create a new database connection
$dbh = pg_connect("host=localhost dbname=mydb user=myuser password=mypassword");

// Execute a query to set the client_min_messages to NOTICE
$res = pg_query($dbh, 'SET client
