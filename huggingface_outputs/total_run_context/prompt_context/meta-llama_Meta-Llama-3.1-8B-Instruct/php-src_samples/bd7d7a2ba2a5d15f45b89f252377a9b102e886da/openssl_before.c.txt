 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID generation. The session ID is not generated randomly, but rather it is based on the nid value which can be controlled by an attacker. This allows an attacker to fixate the session ID and hijack the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Generate a random session ID using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
2. Use a secure method to store and manage session IDs, such as using a secure cookie or a secure session management library.
3. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent session fixation attacks.
