 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session management. The session ID is not being properly validated or regenerated, allowing an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate and validate session IDs, such as using a random number generator or a secure hash function.
2. Regenerate the session ID after a successful login or other sensitive operation.
3. Implement a secure session management mechanism, such as using a library or framework that provides built-in session management functionality.
