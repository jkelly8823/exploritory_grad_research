 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14/None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session management. The session ID is not being properly validated or regenerated, allowing an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session management by validating and regenerating the session ID on each request.
2. Use a secure method to store and manage session IDs, such as using a secure cookie or a token-based system.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in session management and security features.
