 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of restriction on the number of CDF_VECTOR elements. The function cdf_read_property_info in cdf.c does not limit the number of elements, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer by writing 4 bytes out of bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a check to limit the number of CDF_VECTOR elements to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the elements.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious data from being written to the buffer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18218
CVE Description:
cdf_read_property_info in cdf.c in file through 5.37 does not restrict the number of CDF_VECTOR elements, which allows a heap-based buffer overflow (4-byte out-of-bounds write).  This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The vulnerability is caused by the lack of bounds checking on the number of elements in the CDF_VECTOR.  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious CDF
