 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2015-0235 heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The code does not involve the use of the gethostbyname or gethostbyname2 functions, which are the primary vectors for this vulnerability. The code is focused on string manipulation and memory management, which does not seem to be related to the GHOST vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is free from vulnerabilities.
