 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18. This is due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to this issue. The gethostbyname function is used to perform a host lookup, and if the lookup fails, it returns a NULL pointer. However, the code does not check for this NULL pointer before attempting to access the host_entry structure, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as it is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. Check for the NULL pointer returned by gethostbyname before attempting to access the host_entry structure.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure way of performing host lookups, such as using a DNS library.
