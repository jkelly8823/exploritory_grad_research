 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function. This is because the gethostbyname function is not properly checking the length of the hostname before passing it to the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the hostname is longer than the expected length.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as it is more secure and does not have the same buffer overflow vulnerability.
2. Check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function to prevent buffer overflow.
3. Use a safer function like gethostbyname_r to prevent buffer overflow. 
4. Consider using a library like c-ares that provides a more secure way to perform DNS lookups. 
5. Always check the return value of the gethostbyname function to ensure it was successful. 
6. Consider using a secure alternative like the getaddrinfo function. 
7. Use a secure function like gethostbyname_r to prevent buffer overflow. 
8. Always check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function.
