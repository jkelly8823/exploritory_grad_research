 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID validation. The code checks if the session ID is valid, but it does not prevent an attacker from specifying a session ID. This allows an attacker to hijack web sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session ID validation to prevent session fixation attacks.
2. Use a secure random number generator to generate session IDs.
3. Regularly rotate session IDs to prevent session fixation attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  This vulnerability is not applicable to the provided code as it is written in C++ and not PHP. However, the vulnerability is still relevant as it describes a similar session fixation vulnerability. 
Code Sample:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 1024

int main() {
    char buffer[MAX_SIZE];
