VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the session ID is not properly regenerated when a user logs in or out. This allows an attacker to fixate a session ID and then hijack the user's session.  The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the session ID, which can be obtained through various means such as phishing or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
