 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID validation. In the ftp_get function, the ftp->resp is not checked for validity before being used. This allows an attacker to specify a session ID and hijack the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the session ID before using it.
2. Use a secure method to generate and store session IDs.
3. Implement a mechanism to regenerate session IDs after a certain period of inactivity.
