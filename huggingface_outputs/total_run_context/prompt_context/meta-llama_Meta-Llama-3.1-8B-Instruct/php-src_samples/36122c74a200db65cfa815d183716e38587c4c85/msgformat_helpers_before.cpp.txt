 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID validation. The code checks if the session ID is valid, but it does not prevent an attacker from specifying a session ID. This allows an attacker to hijack web sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session ID validation to prevent session fixation attacks.
2. Use a secure random number generator to generate session IDs.
3. Regularly rotate session IDs to prevent session fixation attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The code does not check if the session ID is valid, allowing an attacker to hijack web sessions.  This is a classic example of a session fixation attack.  The code should be modified to check if the session ID is valid before using it.  This can be done by checking if the session ID is in the list of valid session IDs.  If the session ID is not valid, the code should generate a new
