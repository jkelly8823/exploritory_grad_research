 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of session ID validation. In the ftp_get function, the ftp object is not checked for a valid session ID before proceeding with the file transfer. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the session ID in the ftp_get function by checking if it matches the expected session ID.
2. Implement a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
3. Regularly update the PHP version to the latest version, which includes the fix for CVE-2011-4718.
