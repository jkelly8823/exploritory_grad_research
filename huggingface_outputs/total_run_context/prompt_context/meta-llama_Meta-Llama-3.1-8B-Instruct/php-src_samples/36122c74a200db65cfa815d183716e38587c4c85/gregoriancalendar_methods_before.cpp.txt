 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session management. The function _php_intlgregcal_constructor_body() does not properly handle session fixation by not checking if the session ID is valid or not. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session management by checking if the session ID is valid before using it.
2. Use a secure method to generate session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
3. Consider using a session fixation protection mechanism, such as regenerating the session ID after a successful login. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
