 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the use of a static error_filename variable. This variable is not properly sanitized and can be manipulated by an attacker to hijack web sessions. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the error_filename is used in the DTRACE_ERROR function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to generate the error_filename, such as using a random number generator or a secure hash function.
2. Sanitize the error_filename variable to prevent any malicious input from being used.
3. Consider using a more secure logging mechanism that does not rely on static variables.
