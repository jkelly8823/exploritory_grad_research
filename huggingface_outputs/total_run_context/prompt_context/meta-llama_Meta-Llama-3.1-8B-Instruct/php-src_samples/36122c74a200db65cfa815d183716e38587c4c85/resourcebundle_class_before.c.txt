 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session management. The code does not check if the session ID is valid or if it has been tampered with. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session management by checking the session ID and ensuring it is valid.
2. Use a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
3. Regularly clear and regenerate session IDs to prevent session fixation attacks.
