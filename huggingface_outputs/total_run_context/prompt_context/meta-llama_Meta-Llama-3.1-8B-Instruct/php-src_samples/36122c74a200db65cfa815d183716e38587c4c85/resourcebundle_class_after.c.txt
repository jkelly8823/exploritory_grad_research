 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation attacks. The vulnerability is present in the line where the child resource is retrieved using the meindex. The meindex is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify a session ID and hijack the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the meindex before using it to retrieve the child resource.
2. Consider using a secure method to generate and store session IDs, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
3. Implement a session fixation protection mechanism, such as regenerating the session ID after a successful login or when the user's session is updated.  ```c
