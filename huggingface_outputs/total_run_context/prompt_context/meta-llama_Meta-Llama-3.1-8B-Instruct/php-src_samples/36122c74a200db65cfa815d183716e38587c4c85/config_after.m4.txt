 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID management. The session ID is not being properly validated or regenerated, allowing an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session ID management by regenerating the session ID after a successful login or when the session is created.
2. Validate the session ID on each request to ensure it matches the expected session ID.
3. Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the session ID. 
4. Ensure that the session ID is properly stored and retrieved from the database or other storage mechanism.
