 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the use of a static variable 'obj' which is not properly initialized or cleared. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the 'obj' variable before using it.
2. Clear the 'obj' variable after use to prevent session fixation.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and manage session IDs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The vulnerability is due to the use of a static variable 'obj' which is not properly initialized or cleared. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.  The code does not properly handle the 'obj' variable, which can lead to session fixation.  To fix this vulnerability, the 'obj' variable should be initialized before use and cleared after use.  Additionally, a more secure method should be used to store and manage session
