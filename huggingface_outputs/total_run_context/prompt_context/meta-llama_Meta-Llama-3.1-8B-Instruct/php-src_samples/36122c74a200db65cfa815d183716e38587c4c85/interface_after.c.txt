 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the use of a static pointer to a curl_slist structure. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a non-static pointer to the curl_slist structure.
2. Implement a mechanism to generate a unique session ID for each user.
3. Regularly clean up the curl_slist structure to prevent memory leaks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  This vulnerability is present in the code sample provided.  The static pointer to the curl_slist structure allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.  This is a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention.  The recommended fixes are to use a non-static pointer to the curl_slist structure, implement a mechanism to generate a unique session ID for each user, and regularly clean up the curl_slist structure to prevent memory leaks.  These fixes will
