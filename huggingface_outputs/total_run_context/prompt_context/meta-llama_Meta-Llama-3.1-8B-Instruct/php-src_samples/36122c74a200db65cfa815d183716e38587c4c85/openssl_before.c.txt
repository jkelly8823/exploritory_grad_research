 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session management. The function add_assoc_name_entry() does not properly handle session IDs, which can be exploited by an attacker to hijack web sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session management using PHP's built-in session handling functions.
2. Use secure random number generation to generate session IDs.
3. Regularly clean up and regenerate session IDs to prevent session fixation attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718

Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The vulnerability is due to the fact that the session ID is not properly regenerated after a user logs in, allowing an attacker to hijack the session by specifying the same session ID.  This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user's account.  The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher and was patched in PHP 5.5.2.  The patch fixes the issue by properly regenerating the session ID after a
