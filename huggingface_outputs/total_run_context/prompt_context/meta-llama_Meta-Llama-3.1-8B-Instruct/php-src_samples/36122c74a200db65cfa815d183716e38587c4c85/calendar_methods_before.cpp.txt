 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID generation and validation. The function intlcal_get_now does not generate a new session ID, and the session ID is not validated before use. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Generate a new session ID using a secure method, such as a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
2. Validate the session ID before use to ensure it is valid and not tampered with.
3. Consider using a secure session management library or framework to handle session management securely.
