VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the session ID is not regenerated when a new session is created, allowing an attacker to hijack the session by specifying the session ID of the new session.  This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the session ID of the new session.  The vulnerability is not present in PHP 5.5.2 and later versions.
