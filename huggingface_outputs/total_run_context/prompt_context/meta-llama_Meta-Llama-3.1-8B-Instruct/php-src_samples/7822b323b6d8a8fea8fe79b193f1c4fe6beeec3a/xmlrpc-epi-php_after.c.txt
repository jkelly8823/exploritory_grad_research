 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The XMLRPC_REQUEST_FromXML function is called with the raw xml input, and the method name is retrieved using XMLRPC_RequestGetMethodName. However, the code does not appear to be missing a methodName element in the first argument to the xmlrpc_decode_request function, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is handling all possible edge cases. Additionally, consider using a more modern and secure XML-RPC library.  Please note that the code sample does not appear to be using the xmlrpc extension, but rather a custom implementation. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this specific CVE. However, it is still possible that the custom implementation may have similar vulnerabilities. A thorough review of the custom implementation is recommended.  The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to this specific CVE.
