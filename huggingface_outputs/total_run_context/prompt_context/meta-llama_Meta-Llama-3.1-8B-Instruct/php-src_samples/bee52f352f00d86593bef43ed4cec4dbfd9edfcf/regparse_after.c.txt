 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-9226, a heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. The issue arises from the handling of octal numbers larger than 0xff in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the octal number before processing it to ensure it does not exceed 0xff.
2. Implement a check to handle octal numbers larger than 0xff correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc().
3. Consider using a safer method to handle code point values, such as using a separate data structure to store the code points.
