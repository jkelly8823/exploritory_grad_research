 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds write due to an uninitialized variable. The variable *state is used as an index without being initialized, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write memory corruption. This is consistent with the description of the CVE-2017-9228 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the variable *state before using it as an index.
2. Use a safe and secure method to handle regular expression compilation to prevent similar vulnerabilities. 
3. Consider using a memory-safe language or framework to prevent such vulnerabilities.  ```python
