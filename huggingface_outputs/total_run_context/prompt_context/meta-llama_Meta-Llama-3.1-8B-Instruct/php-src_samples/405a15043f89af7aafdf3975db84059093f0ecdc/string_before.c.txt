 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for potential integer overflows before allocating memory and performing operations. It checks if out_len is greater than INT_MAX or less than or equal to 0, preventing potential overflows. However, it does not check for overflows in the calculation of out_len itself. This could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the values of srclen, chunks, and endlen are large enough.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the calculation of out_len does not overflow. This can be done by checking if the sum of srclen, chunks, and endlen is greater than INT_MAX before calculating out_len.
2. Consider using a safer method to calculate out_len, such as using a library function that handles integer overflows. 
3. Consider using a safer method to allocate memory, such as using a library function that handles memory allocation errors.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
