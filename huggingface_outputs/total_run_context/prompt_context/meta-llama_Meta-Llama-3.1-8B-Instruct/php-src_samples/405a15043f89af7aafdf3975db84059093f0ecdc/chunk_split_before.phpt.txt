 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2007-2872 vulnerability. This is because the chunk_split function is being called with an argument of 65535, which is an integer overflow. The chunk_split function does not properly handle this overflow, leading to a potential denial of service or code execution vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the arguments passed to the chunk_split function are within a safe range. This can be achieved by adding input validation and sanitization to prevent integer overflows. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a more secure version of the chunk_split function, such as one that uses a safer algorithm for splitting strings.
