 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the chunk_split function. The function is called with large values for the arguments, which can cause the function to overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code. The first call to chunk_split is successful, but the second call fails due to the overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the developers should ensure that the arguments passed to the chunk_split function are within the valid range. This can be done by adding input validation and sanitization to prevent large values from being passed to the function. Additionally, the developers should consider upgrading to a version of PHP that is not vulnerable to this issue.
