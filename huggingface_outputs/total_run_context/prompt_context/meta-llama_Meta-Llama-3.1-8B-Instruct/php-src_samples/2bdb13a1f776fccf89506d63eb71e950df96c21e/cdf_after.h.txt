 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly interacts with the cdf_read_property_info function in cdf.c. The code defines constants and macros but does not include any code that could potentially lead to a heap-based buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds write.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code that interacts with the cdf_read_property_info function to ensure that it adheres to the necessary security guidelines and best practices. Additionally, consider implementing bounds checking and input validation to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18218, CVE Description: cdf_read_property_info in cdf.c in file through 5.37 does not restrict the number of CDF_VECTOR elements, which allows a heap-based buffer overflow (4-byte out-of-bounds write).
