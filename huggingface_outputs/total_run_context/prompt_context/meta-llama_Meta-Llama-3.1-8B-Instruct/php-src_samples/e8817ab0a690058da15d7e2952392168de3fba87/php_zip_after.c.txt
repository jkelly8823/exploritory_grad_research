 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-170: NULL Pointer Dereference. This is because the function `zip_stat` is called with a pointer to `sb` which is not checked for null before the function call. If `zip_stat` returns an error, it will set `sb` to null, and then the code will attempt to access `sb` in the next line, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of `zip_stat` before accessing `sb`.
2. Initialize `sb` to a valid pointer before calling `zip_stat`.
3. Use a try-catch block to handle the case where `zip_stat` returns an error.
