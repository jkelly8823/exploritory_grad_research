 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow a remote attacker to bypass open_basedir restrictions via vectors related to the length of a filename. The code checks if the resolved name starts with the resolved basedir, and if not, it checks if the resolved basedir is a subdirectory of the resolved name. This is a valid check to prevent directory traversal attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure against the described vulnerability.
