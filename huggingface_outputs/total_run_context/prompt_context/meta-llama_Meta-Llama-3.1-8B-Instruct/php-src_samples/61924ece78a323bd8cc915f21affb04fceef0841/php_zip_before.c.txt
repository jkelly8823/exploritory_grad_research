 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-170 because it does not properly terminate the path_cleaned string. The php_zip_make_relative_path function may return a string that is longer than MAXPATHLEN, causing a buffer overflow when strlen is called. Additionally, the zip_stat function may return an error, causing the function to return 0 without properly cleaning up the path_cleaned string.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the path_cleaned string before calling strlen to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer function to clean the path, such as realpath, to prevent potential issues with php_zip_make_relative_path.
3. Check the return value of zip_stat to ensure it does not return an error before proceeding. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119

		//... rest of the code...
	}
	$zip->close();
	$zip = null;
	return 0
