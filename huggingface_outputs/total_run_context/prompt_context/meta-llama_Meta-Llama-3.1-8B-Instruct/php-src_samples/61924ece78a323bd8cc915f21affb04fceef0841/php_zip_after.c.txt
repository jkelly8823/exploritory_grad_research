 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CWE-170: Incorrectly Terminated Strings. The variable "path_cleaned" is a string that is not properly terminated with a null character. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the string is used in subsequent operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the "path_cleaned" string is properly terminated with a null character before using it in subsequent operations.
2. Consider using a safer method to handle string lengths, such as using a fixed-size buffer or a string class that handles null-termination automatically. 
3. Review the "MAXPATHLEN" constant to ensure it is correctly set and not too small for the expected path lengths. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CWE_ID: 119

The product does not check for the existence of a resource before using it.

	$zip_file = fopen($zip_file, 'r');
	if ($zip_file === false)
