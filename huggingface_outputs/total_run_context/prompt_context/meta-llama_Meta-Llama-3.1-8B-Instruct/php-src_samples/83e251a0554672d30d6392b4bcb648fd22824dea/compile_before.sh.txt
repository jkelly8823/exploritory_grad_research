EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a bash script that appears to be a configuration script for a PHP build process. It does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function issue described in the provided CVEs. The script is simply executing a series of commands to configure the build process, including running./buildconf and./configure with various options.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential security issues related to the execution of external commands or the use of untrusted input. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the build process is properly secured and that any sensitive information is handled securely.  ```bash
