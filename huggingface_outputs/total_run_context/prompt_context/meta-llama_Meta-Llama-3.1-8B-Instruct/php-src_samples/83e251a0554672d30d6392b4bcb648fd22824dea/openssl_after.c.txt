 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073, a man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability. This is due to the way the code handles the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in X.509 certificates. The code does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the SAN field, which allows an attacker to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073.
2. Use a secure method to handle the SAN field in X.509 certificates, such as using a secure string library.
3. Validate the input data to ensure that it does not contain any malicious characters, such as '\0'. 
4. Consider using a secure certificate validation library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 5. Consider using a secure certificate validation library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 6. Consider using a secure certificate validation library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 7. Consider using a secure certificate validation library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 8.
