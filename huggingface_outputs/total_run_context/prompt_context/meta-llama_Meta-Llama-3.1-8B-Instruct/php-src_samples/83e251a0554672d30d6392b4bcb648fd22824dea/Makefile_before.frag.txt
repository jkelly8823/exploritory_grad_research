 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the OpenSSL library or its functions, such as OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity. The code appears to be a Makefile snippet that installs the PHP CGI binary and its man page. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-4073 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the CVE-2013-4073 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4073
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary
