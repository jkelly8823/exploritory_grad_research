 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function vulnerability. The code is allocating memory for a buffer using safe_pemalloc and then performing operations on that buffer. There is no indication of any SSL certificate verification or manipulation of X.509 certificates. The vulnerability is related to the handling of '\0' characters in domain names within X.509 certificates, which is not relevant to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2009-2408
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
