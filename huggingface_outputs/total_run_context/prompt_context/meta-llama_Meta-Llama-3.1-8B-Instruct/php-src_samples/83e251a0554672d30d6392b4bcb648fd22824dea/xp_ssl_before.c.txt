 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073 because it uses the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function which does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that properly handles '\0' characters in domain names.
2. Use a secure alternative to OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity, such as OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity_with_null_handling.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as certificate pinning, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  VULNERABLE: YES
