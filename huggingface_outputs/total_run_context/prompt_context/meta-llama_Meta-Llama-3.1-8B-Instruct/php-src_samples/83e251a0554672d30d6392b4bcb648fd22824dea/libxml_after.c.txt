 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247. The code is written in C and appears to be part of the PHP extension for libxml. It does not involve any SSL or certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest libxml and OpenSSL versions to ensure any potential vulnerabilities are addressed. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator for any cryptographic operations.
