 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247. The code snippet provided is a conditional statement that checks if a certain condition is met, and if so, it calls a function. There is no code that handles X.509 certificates or performs SSL verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function.  The code is also not related to Ruby, but rather appears to be C code.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-4073 vulnerability.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is properly secured.  Consider using a code review tool or a static analysis tool to identify any potential vulnerabilities.  Additionally, ensure that the code is properly tested and validated to ensure that it
