 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be written in Ruby, nor does it appear to be using the OpenSSL library. The code is written in PHP and appears to be a configuration file for a PHP application. The vulnerabilities listed are specific to Ruby and OpenSSL, and do not appear to be relevant to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any configuration files are properly secured and do not contain sensitive information. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store sensitive information.  --END-- 
VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-14106
