 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack due to the use of the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb, which does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2009-2408 and CVE-2013-4073.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. Use a secure method to verify the certificate identity, such as using a trusted certificate authority.
3. Consider using a different library or implementation that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
4. Validate the input data to prevent any potential attacks. 
5. Use secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
