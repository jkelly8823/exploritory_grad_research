 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073 because it does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate. This is evident in lines 14-15 where the code attempts to print the extension using X509V3_EXT_print, which may not handle '\0' characters correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure function to handle the printing of extensions, such as X509_NAME_print_ex.
2. Validate the input data to ensure it does not contain any '\0' characters.
3. Consider using a more secure library or framework to handle X.509 certificate parsing and validation.  ```bash
