 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a bash script that appears to be configuring a PHP build environment. It does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function issue described in the provided CVEs. The script is using the bash shell to execute commands, and the vulnerabilities mentioned are related to Ruby's OpenSSL implementation, not bash or the PHP build process.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is recommended to ensure that the build environment is properly secured and that any dependencies are up-to-date to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for executing the configure command, such as using a tool like `make` or `cmake` that can handle dependencies and build options more securely.
