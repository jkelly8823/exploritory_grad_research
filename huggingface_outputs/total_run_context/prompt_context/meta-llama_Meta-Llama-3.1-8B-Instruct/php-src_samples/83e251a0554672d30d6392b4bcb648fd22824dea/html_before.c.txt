 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-4073 due to the presence of the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in the lib/openssl/ssl.rb file. This function does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that properly handles the '\0' character in the Subject Alternative Name field.
2. Use a secure certificate verification method that does not rely on the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function.
3. Consider using a secure alternative to the OpenSSL library, such as a modern TLS library.
