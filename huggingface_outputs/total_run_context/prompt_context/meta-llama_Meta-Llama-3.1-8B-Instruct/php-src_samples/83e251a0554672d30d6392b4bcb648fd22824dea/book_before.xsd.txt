 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is an XML Schema Definition (XSD) snippet that defines a complex type with a sequence of two elements: 'title' and 'author'. Both elements are of type 'xs:string'. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the OpenSSL library or certificate verification, as it is a schema definition and not a code implementation of the OpenSSL library. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-4073 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications. However, it is recommended to ensure that the XSD is properly validated and used in a secure manner to prevent any potential issues.  ```bash
