 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that directly relates to the OpenSSL library or the verification of SSL certificates. The variables and functions used in this code snippet appear to be related to string manipulation and pattern matching, which does not align with the vulnerability described in the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any external libraries or dependencies used in the code are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities.  The code sample does not appear to use any external libraries or dependencies that would be affected by the described CVEs.  Further analysis of the code and its dependencies may be necessary to ensure that it is secure.  It is also recommended to follow secure coding practices, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  Additionally, consider using a secure coding standard, such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices, to ensure that the code is written with security in mind.  Finally, consider using a code analysis tool, such as a static analysis tool, to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  This will
