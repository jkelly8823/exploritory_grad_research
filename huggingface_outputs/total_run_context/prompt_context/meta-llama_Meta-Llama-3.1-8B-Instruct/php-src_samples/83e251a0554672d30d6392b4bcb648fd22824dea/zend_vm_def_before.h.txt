 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that is related to the OpenSSL library or the verification of SSL certificates. The code appears to be checking if an exception was caught and if so, it calls a function to handle the exception. The code does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-4073 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the OpenSSL library or SSL certificate verification. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices.

CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4073
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary
