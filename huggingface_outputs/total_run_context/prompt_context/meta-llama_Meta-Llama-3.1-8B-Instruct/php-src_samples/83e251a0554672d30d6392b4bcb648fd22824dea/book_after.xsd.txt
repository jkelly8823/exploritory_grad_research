EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is an XML Schema Definition (XSD) snippet that defines a complex type for a book element. It includes elements for title and author, as well as an attribute for indicating whether the book is a hardback. The code does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities related to the OpenSSL or SSL/TLS protocol, as it is an XML schema definition and not a piece of code that interacts with the OpenSSL library. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to the specified CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications to address the specified vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date and follow best practices for secure coding.  ```bash
