 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function or the handling of X.509 certificates. The function multipart_buffer_headers appears to be related to parsing HTTP headers, which is a different aspect of the Ruby framework.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE descriptions. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that the code is properly sanitized and validated to prevent potential security issues. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure parsing and validation of HTTP headers.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4073
CVE Description:
The OpenSSL::SSL.verify_certificate_identity function in lib/openssl/ssl.rb in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.7-p374, 1.9 before 1.9.3-p448, and 2.0 before 2.0.0-p247 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via
