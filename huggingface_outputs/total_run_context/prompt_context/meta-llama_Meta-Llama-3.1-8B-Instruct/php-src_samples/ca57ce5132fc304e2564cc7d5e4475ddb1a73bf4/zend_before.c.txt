 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session management. The error handling mechanism does not properly handle session IDs, allowing an attacker to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper session management by using a secure session ID generation mechanism.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent session fixation attacks.
3. Consider using a secure error handling mechanism that does not expose sensitive information, such as session IDs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
