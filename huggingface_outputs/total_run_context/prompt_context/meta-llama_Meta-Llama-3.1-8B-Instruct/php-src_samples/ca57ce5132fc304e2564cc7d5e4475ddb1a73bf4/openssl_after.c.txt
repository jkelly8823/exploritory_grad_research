 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to session fixation due to the lack of proper session ID generation and validation. The session ID is not generated randomly, and the code does not check if the session ID is valid before using it. This allows an attacker to hijack the session by specifying a session ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure random number generator to generate the session ID.
2. Validate the session ID before using it to ensure it is valid and not tampered with.
3. Implement a secure session management mechanism to prevent session fixation attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4718
CVE Description:
Session fixation vulnerability in the Sessions subsystem in PHP before 5.5.2 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions by specifying a session ID.  The code does not properly validate the session ID, allowing an attacker to hijack the session.  The code also does not properly generate the session ID, making it predictable and vulnerable to session fixation attacks.  The code should use a secure random number generator to generate the session ID and validate the session ID before using it.  This will prevent session
