 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any PHP code, and the vulnerability is specific to PHP. The code appears to be a shell script or a Makefile, which is not susceptible to the session fixation vulnerability in PHP.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any PHP code, so there is no need to make any changes to prevent this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date and follow secure coding practices.  The code should be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities.  Consider using a static code analysis tool to identify potential issues.  Consider using a linter to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early.  Consider using a code review process to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices.  Consider using a secure coding guide to ensure that the code is secure.  Consider using a secure coding tool to identify potential issues.  Consider using a secure coding framework to ensure that the code is secure.  Consider using a secure coding library to ensure that the code is secure.  Consider using a secure coding best practice to ensure that the code is secure.  Consider using a secure coding checklist to
