 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-0191 because it loads an external DTD (dom.ent) which can be used to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted XML document. The xmlParserHandlePEReference function in libxml2 is used to load the external DTD, which is not validated or substituted, allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the external DTD reference from the code.
2. Use a secure XML parser that does not load external DTDs by default.
3. Validate the XML document before loading it to prevent resource consumption attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0191
CVE Description:
The xmlParserHandlePEReference function in parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.2, as used in Web Listener in Oracle HTTP Server in Oracle Fusion Middleware 11.1.1.7.0, 12.1.2.0, and 12.1.3.0 and other products, loads external parameter entities regardless of whether entity substitution or validation is enabled, which
