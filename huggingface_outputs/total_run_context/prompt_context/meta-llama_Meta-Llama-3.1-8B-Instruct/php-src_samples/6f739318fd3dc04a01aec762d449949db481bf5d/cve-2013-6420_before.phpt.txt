 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-6420 vulnerability. This is because the code attempts to parse a crafted X.509 certificate that contains an illegal ASN1 data type for a timestamp. The openssl_x509_parse function is not able to handle this type of data, resulting in a memory corruption error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the PHP version to 5.3.28 or later, 5.4.23 or later, or 5.5.7 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure method to parse X.509 certificates, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.
3. Validate the input data to ensure that it conforms to the expected format before passing it to the openssl_x509_parse function.
