 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. This function is used to perform a hostname lookup, and if the input string is crafted in a specific way, it can cause the function to overflow the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with a safer alternative, such as getaddrinfo.
2. Use a hostname lookup library that is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability, such as the one provided by the c-ares library.
3. Implement a bounds checking mechanism to prevent the buffer overflow from occurring. This can be done by checking the length of the input string before passing it to the gethostbyname function. 
4. Consider using a more modern and secure way of performing hostname lookups, such as using the DNS resolver API. 
5. If possible, upgrade the glibc library to a version that is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
