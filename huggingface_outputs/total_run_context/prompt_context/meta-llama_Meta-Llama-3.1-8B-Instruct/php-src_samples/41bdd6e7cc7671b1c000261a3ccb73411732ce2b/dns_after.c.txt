 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-0235 vulnerability because it does not properly check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
2. Use a safer function such as getaddrinfo to resolve hostnames instead of gethostbyname.
3. Consider using a library that provides a more secure way to resolve hostnames, such as c-ares.

CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST."
