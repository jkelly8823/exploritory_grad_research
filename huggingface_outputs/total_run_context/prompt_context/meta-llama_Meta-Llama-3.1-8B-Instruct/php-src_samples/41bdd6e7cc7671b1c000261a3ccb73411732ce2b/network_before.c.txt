 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235) because it uses the gethostbyname function, which is affected by this vulnerability. The gethostbyname function is used on line 24 to get the host information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with the getaddrinfo function, which is not affected by this vulnerability.
2. If the getaddrinfo function is not available, use a safe alternative such as the gethostbyname2 function, which is also not affected by this vulnerability.
3. Consider using a library that provides a safe and secure way to perform DNS lookups, such as the c-ares library. 
4. If the gethostbyname function is used, ensure that the host information is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security issues. 
5. Consider using a secure DNS resolver, such as the unbound DNS resolver, to perform DNS lookups. 
6. If the gethostbyname function is used, ensure that the error handling is properly implemented to prevent any potential security issues. 
7. Consider using a secure library, such as the c-ares
