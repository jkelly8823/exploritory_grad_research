 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. The code does not use the gethostbyname or gethostbyname2 functions, which are the functions that are vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. The code does use the gethostbyname function, but it checks the return value and the address type before using the address list, which prevents the buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. However, it would be a good idea to consider using the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as it is a more modern and secure function. Additionally, the code could be improved by checking the return value of the gethostbyname function more thoroughly, and by using a safer way to handle the address list.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2
