 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. The GHOST vulnerability is related to the gethostbyname and gethostbyname2 functions in glibc, which are not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be manipulating strings using the Zend engine, which is a PHP extension.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices.
