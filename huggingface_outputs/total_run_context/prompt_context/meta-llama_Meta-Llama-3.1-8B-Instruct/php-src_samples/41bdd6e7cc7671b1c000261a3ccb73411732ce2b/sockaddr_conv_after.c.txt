EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. This function is used to perform a hostname lookup, and the code does not properly validate the length of the hostname, making it susceptible to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with a more secure alternative, such as getaddrinfo.
2. Validate the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function.
3. Consider using a hostname lookup library that is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. 4. If possible, upgrade the glibc version to 2.18 or later, which is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. 5. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a safe function to perform the hostname lookup. 6. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a safe function to perform the hostname lookup. 7. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a safe function to perform the hostname lookup. 8. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a safe function to perform
