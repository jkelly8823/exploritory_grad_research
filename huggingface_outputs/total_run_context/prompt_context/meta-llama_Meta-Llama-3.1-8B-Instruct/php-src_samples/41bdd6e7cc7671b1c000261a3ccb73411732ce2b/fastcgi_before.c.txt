 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235) due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. The gethostbyname function is deprecated and should not be used in modern code. Instead, the getaddrinfo function should be used, which is safer and more secure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with the getaddrinfo function.
2. Use the ai_family parameter to specify the address family (AF_INET) to ensure that the function returns the correct type of address.
3. Check the return value of the getaddrinfo function to ensure that it was successful.
4. Use the ai_addrlen parameter to get the length of the address, and then use the ai_addr parameter to get the address itself. This will prevent any potential buffer overflows.
