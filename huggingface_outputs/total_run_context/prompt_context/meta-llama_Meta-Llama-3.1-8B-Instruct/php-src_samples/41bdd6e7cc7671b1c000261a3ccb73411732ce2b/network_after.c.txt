 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function. This is because the code does not check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function. If the hostname is longer than MAXHOSTNAMELEN, it will cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the length of the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function.
2. Use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as it is more secure and does not have the same buffer overflow vulnerability.
