 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235) due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. The gethostbyname function is deprecated and should not be used in new code. Instead, the gethostbyname2 function should be used, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the gethostbyname function with the gethostbyname2 function.
2. Use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, which is a more modern and secure way to perform DNS lookups.
3. Consider using a DNS library that is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability, such as the one provided by the c-ares library. 4. If possible, upgrade to a version of glibc that is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. 5. If upgrading glibc is not possible, consider using a different programming language or framework that is not vulnerable to this issue. 6. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using deprecated functions. 7. Use a static analysis tool to identify and fix similar vulnerabilities in
