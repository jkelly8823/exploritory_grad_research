VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The variable "property_info" is not initialized before it is used. This can lead to unpredictable results as the memory location pointed to by "property_info" is not guaranteed to be valid.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the "property_info" variable before using it. This can be done by calling the "zend_property_info_init" function to allocate memory for the "property_info" structure. For example:
```php
zend_property_info_init(&property_info);
```
VULNERABILITY LIST:

    //...
}
