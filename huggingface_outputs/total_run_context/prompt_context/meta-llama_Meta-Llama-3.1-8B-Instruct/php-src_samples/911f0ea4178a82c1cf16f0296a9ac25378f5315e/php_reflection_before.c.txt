EXPLANATION:
The variable "property_info" is not initialized before it is used. This can lead to unpredictable results or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the "property_info" variable before using it. This can be done by setting it to NULL before the if statement. For example: zend_property_info property_info = NULL; 
```c
if (zend_get_property_info(ce, hash_key->key, 1) == NULL) {
	zend_property_info property_info = NULL;
	// rest of the code
}
``` 
Alternatively, you can also declare the variable before the if statement and initialize it to NULL. For example:
```c
zend_property_info property_info = NULL;
if (zend_get_property_info(ce, hash_key->key, 1) == NULL) {
	// rest of the code
}
``` 
This will ensure that the variable is properly initialized before it is used.
