 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution due to insufficient escaping when using proc_open() command with array syntax. The is_executed_by_cmd() function checks if a program is executed by cmd.exe, but it does not properly sanitize the input, allowing a malicious user to supply arguments that would execute arbitrary commands in Windows shell.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the input to the is_executed_by_cmd() function to prevent arbitrary command execution.
2. Use a secure method to construct the command, such as using escapeshellarg() or escapeshellcmd() to prevent shell injection attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to execute commands, such as using the exec() function with a secure command string.
