 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any direct implementation of the crypt_des function. However, the code does contain configuration settings related to Unicode encoding and error handling. These settings may be related to the vulnerability, but they do not directly indicate the presence of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Review the code that calls the write_information function to ensure that it properly handles Unicode passwords. Consider implementing additional checks to prevent authentication attempts with initial substrings of intended passwords. Additionally, consider updating the Unicode encoding settings to ensure they are consistent and secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.  The code does not contain any direct implementation of the crypt_des function, but the provided configuration settings may be related to
