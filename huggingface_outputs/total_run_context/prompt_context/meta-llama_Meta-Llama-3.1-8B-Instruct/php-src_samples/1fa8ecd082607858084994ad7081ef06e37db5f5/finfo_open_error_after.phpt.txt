VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly uses the crypt_des function or any other function that is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability. The code is a test for the finfo_open function, which is not related to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to ensure that any external libraries or functions used in the code are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2. ```php
// Example of secure password hashing using bcrypt
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
``` ```php
// Example of secure password hashing using Argon2
$hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_ARGON2I);
``` ```php
// Example of secure password hashing using Argon2id
$hashedPassword
