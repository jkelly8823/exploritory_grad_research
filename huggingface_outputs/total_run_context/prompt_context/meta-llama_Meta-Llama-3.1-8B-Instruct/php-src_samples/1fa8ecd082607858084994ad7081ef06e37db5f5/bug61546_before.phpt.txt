 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability because it uses the crypt_des function, which does not process the complete cleartext password if it contains a 0x80 character. This makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the crypt_des function and instead use a more secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2.
2. Ensure that the password does not contain any 0x80 characters.
3. Consider using a password hashing library that is designed to handle Unicode passwords securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.
