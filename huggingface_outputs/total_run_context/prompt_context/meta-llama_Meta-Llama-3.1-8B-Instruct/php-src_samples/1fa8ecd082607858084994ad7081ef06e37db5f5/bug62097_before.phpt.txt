 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability because it uses the crypt_des function, which does not process the complete cleartext password if it contains a 0x80 character. This is evident in the code where it checks for 32-bit machines and uses the crypt_des function. The function is used in the context of password authentication, making it a potential entry point for attackers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the crypt_des function with a more secure password hashing function, such as bcrypt or Argon2.
2. Update the code to handle passwords with 0x80 characters correctly, either by removing the character or by using a more secure password hashing function.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure password handling, such as PHP's built-in password_hash function.

CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a
