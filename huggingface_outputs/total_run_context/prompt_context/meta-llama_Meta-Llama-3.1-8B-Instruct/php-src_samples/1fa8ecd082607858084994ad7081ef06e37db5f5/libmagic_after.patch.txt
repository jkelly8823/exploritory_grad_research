 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1825-1834
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `regcomp` function without proper error handling. The `regcomp` function is used to compile a regular expression, but it does not check for buffer overflows. If a malicious user provides a regular expression that is too large, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper error handling for the `regcomp` function. You can do this by checking the return value of `regcomp` and handling any errors that may occur. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure regular expression library that is designed to prevent buffer overflows.

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with
