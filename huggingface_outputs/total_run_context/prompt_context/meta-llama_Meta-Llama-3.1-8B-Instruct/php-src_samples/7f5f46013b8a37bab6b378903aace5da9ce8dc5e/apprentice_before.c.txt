 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (CPU consumption) due to a regex search that does not properly restrict the amount of data read. This is a known issue in the file library before version 5.19, which is similar to CVE-2013-7345. The code is commented out, but it is still present and could be enabled in the future.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the commented out code to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
2. Consider upgrading the file library to version 5.19 or later to fix the known issue.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent denial of service attacks.  ```python
