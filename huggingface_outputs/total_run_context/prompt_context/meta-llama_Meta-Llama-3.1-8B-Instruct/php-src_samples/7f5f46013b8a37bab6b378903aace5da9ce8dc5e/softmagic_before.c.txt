 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3538 because it does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search. The line `bytecnt = linecnt * 80;` calculates the maximum number of bytes to read, but it does not take into account the possibility of a large input buffer. This can cause the PCRE engine to get stuck if the input buffer is too big.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the input buffer size is not too large before performing the regex search.
2. Consider using a more robust regex engine that can handle large input buffers.
3. If possible, limit the maximum number of bytes that can be read during the regex search to prevent denial of service attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-7345
CVE Description:
The PCRE library before 8.32 does not properly handle certain patterns, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted regular expression that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
