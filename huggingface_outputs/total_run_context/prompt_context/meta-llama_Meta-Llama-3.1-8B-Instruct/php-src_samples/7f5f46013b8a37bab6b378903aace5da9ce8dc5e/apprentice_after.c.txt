 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-3538 vulnerability because it uses the pcre_cache_entry to store compiled regular expressions. However, the code does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the pcre library to version 5.19 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a more secure way to store and retrieve compiled regular expressions, such as using a secure cache or a more secure regex engine.
3. Implement a limit on the amount of data read during a regex search to prevent backtracking and denial of service attacks.

CVE Description:
file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.
