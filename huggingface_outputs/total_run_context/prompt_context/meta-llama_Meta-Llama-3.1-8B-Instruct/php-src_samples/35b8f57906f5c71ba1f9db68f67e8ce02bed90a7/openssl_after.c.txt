 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The line `thestr = strbuf + ASN1_STRING_length(timestr) - 3;` calculates the position of `thestr` based on the length of `timestr`, but does not account for the possibility of a null character at the end of the string. If `timestr` contains a null character, `thestr` will point to a location before the end of the string, causing a buffer overflow when `thestr` is used as a pointer to a string.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for null characters at the end of `timestr` before calculating the position of `thestr`.
2. Use a safer method to parse the time string, such as using a dedicated time parsing library.
3. Consider using a buffer overflow protection mechanism, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP).  VULNERABLE: YES
