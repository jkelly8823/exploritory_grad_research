 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that could potentially lead to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) via a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. The code seems to be a simple output of a string, which does not match the description of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.  The code is clean and does not contain any potential security risks.  However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it is working as expected.  Consider adding input validation and error handling to make the code more robust.  Additionally, consider using a secure coding practice such as secure coding guidelines to ensure the code is secure.  Consider using a code review tool to review the code and identify potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a static analysis tool to analyze the code and identify potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a dynamic analysis tool to analyze the code and identify potential security vulnerabilities.
