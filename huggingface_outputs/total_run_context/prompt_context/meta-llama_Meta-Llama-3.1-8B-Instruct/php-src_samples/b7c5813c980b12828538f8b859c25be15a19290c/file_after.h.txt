 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This is because the code does not properly validate the offset value before using it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the offset value before using it to prevent infinite recursion and CPU consumption.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the depth of recursion to prevent a crash.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure to store the magic values to prevent a denial of service attack.

CVE Description:
Fine Free file before 5.17 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) via a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file.
