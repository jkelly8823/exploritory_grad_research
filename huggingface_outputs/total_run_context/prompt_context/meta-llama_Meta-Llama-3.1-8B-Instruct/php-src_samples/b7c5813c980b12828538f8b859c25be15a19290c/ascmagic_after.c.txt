 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This is because the `encode_utf8` function does not properly handle invalid Unicode characters, which can cause it to enter an infinite recursion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper Unicode character validation in the `encode_utf8` function to prevent infinite recursion.
2. Add error handling to the `encode_utf8` function to return an error code when an invalid Unicode character is encountered.
3. Consider using a more robust Unicode encoding library, such as ICU, to handle Unicode character encoding and decoding.
