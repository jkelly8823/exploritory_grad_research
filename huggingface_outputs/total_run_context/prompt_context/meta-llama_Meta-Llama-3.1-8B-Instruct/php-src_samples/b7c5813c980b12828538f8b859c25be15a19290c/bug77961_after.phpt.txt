 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-1943 vulnerability because it is using the finfo_open function with an indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This can cause a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) via a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the finfo library to version 5.17 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure method to load the magic database, such as using a secure file path and checking the file existence before loading it.
3. Validate the input data to prevent any potential attacks.
