 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-1943 vulnerability because it is using the finfo_open function with an invalid argument type. The error message indicates that the expected numeric type was received as `indirect', which is a type that can cause the infinite recursion and CPU consumption mentioned in the CVE description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the finfo_open function is called with a valid numeric argument.
2. Update the finfo library to version 5.17 or later to fix the vulnerability. 
3. Implement input validation to prevent the use of invalid argument types.
