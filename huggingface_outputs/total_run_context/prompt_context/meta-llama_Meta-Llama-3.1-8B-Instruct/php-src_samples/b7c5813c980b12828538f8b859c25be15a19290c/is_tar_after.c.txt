 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to the lack of input validation in the `from_oct` function. The function does not check if the input string is null or empty, which can lead to an infinite recursion and eventually a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a null check for the input string `where` in the `from_oct` function.
2. Add a check to ensure that the input string is not empty before attempting to decode the octal number.
3. Consider using a safer function to decode the octal number, such as `strtol` or `strtoul`, which can handle errors and provide more robust input validation.
