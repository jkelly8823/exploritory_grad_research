 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This is because the code does not properly validate the input to the cdf_ctime function, allowing an attacker to potentially cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the cdf_ctime function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a more secure function like asctime_r to prevent buffer overflows.
