 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of the strcasestr function, which is not available on all platforms. This function is used in the AC_CHECK_FUNCS macro to check for the presence of the strcasestr function. If the function is not available, the code will attempt to use it, leading to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a platform-independent way to check for the presence of the strcasestr function, such as using a feature test macro.
2. Provide a fallback implementation for the strcasestr function, or use a different function that is available on all platforms.
3. Consider using a more robust way to handle the absence of the strcasestr function, such as returning an error code or using a default value.
