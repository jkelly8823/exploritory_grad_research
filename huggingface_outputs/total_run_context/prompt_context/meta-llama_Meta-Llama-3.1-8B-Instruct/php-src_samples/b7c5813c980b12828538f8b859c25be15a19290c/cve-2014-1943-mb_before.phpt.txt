 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This is a known issue in the finfo_file() function before version 5.17.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade the finfo_file() function to version 5.17 or later to fix this vulnerability. Alternatively, use a secure alternative to finfo_file() that is not affected by this issue.
