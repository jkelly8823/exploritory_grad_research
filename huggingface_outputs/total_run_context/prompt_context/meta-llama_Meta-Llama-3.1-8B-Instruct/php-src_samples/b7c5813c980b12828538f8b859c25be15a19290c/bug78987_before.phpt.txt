 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the potential for infinite recursion in the for loop. The loop condition is set to $size <= $maxSize, which can lead to an infinite loop if the value of $size is not properly bounded. Additionally, the str_repeat function can cause a high CPU consumption if the size of the string is large.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the value of $size is properly bounded to prevent infinite recursion.
2. Consider using a more efficient method to generate the string, such as using a loop instead of str_repeat.
3. Add a check to prevent the size of the string from being too large, which can cause high CPU consumption.
