 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This is because the code does not properly validate the input before passing it to the fprintf function, which can lead to a buffer overflow and subsequent crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation to ensure that the indirect offset value is within a valid range before passing it to the fprintf function.
2. Consider using a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Implement a mechanism to detect and handle crafted indirect offset values to prevent denial of service attacks.
