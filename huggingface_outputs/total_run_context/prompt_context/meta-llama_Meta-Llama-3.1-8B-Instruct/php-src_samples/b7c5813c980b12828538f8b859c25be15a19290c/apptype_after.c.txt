 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite recursion, CPU consumption, and crash) due to a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file. This is because the code does not properly validate the input before passing it to the file_printf function, which can lead to a buffer overflow and subsequent crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input before passing it to the file_printf function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer function like file_snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a more secure function like file_printf_s to prevent buffer overflows.
