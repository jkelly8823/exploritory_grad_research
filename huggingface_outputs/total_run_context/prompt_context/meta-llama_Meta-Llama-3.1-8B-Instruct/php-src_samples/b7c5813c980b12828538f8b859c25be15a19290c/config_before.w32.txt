 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is using the libmagic library, but it does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted indirect offset value in the magic of a file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is recommended to keep the libmagic library up to date to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are patched.
