 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is downloading and extracting a tarball, but it does not appear to be using the Fine Free file library, which is the library that is vulnerable to the described issue. Additionally, the vulnerability is specific to versions of Fine Free file before 5.17, and the code is specifying version 5.45.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to keep software up to date and to use the latest version of any library or software. In this case, the code is already using the latest version of Fine Free file.  The code could be improved by adding error checking to ensure that the tarball was downloaded and extracted successfully. This could be done by checking the return value of the tar command and the wget command. For example:
```bash
if! tar -xz --strip-components=2 -C libmagic.orig file-$VERSION/src; then
  echo "Error extracting tarball"
  exit 1
fi
``` 
```bash
if! wget -O - ftp://ftp.astron
