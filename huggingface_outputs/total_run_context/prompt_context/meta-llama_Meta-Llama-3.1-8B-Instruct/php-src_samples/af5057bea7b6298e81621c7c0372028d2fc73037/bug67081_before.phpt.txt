 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-0191 because it loads external parameter entities from the XML files "bug67081_0.xml", "bug67081_1.xml", and "bug67081_2.xml" without validating or substituting them. This allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted XML document.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the XML files before loading them into the DOMDocument object.
2. Use the libxml_use_internal_errors() function to suppress any errors that may occur during XML parsing.
3. Use the DOMDocument::loadXML() function instead of DOMDocument::load() to prevent external entity loading. 
4. Use a whitelist approach to only allow loading of specific XML files from trusted sources. 
5. Consider using a more secure XML parsing library, such as xmlsec.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
