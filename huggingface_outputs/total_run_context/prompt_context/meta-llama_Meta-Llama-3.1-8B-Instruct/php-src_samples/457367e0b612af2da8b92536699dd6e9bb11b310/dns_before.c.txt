 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235) due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is known to be vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. The gethostbyname function is called on line 14, and the result is stored in the hp variable. However, the code does not check the return value of gethostbyname, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the function returns an invalid or corrupted result.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the return value of gethostbyname and handle any errors that may occur. This can be done by checking if hp is NULL or if hp->h_addr_list is NULL, as is done in the code. However, this is not sufficient to prevent the GHOST vulnerability, as the vulnerability can occur even if hp is not NULL. To fully prevent the vulnerability, the code should be modified to use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname, as getaddrinfo is not vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle any errors that may occur when using
