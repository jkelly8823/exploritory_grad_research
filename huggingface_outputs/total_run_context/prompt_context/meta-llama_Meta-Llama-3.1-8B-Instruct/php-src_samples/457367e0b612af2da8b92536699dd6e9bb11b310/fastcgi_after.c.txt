 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function. This is because the gethostbyname function is not properly checked for NULL before accessing its members. If the function returns NULL, it will cause a segmentation fault. Additionally, the code does not check if the h_addr_list[1] is NULL before accessing it, which can also cause a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the gethostbyname function returns NULL before accessing its members.
2. Check if the h_addr_list[1] is NULL before accessing it.
3. Use a safer function like getaddrinfo to resolve host names.
4. Use a safer function like readv to read from the socket. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "
