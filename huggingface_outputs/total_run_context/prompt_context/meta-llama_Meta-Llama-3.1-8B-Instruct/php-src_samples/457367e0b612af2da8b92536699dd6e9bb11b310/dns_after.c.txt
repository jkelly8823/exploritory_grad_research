 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for the length of the hostname before calling gethostbyname. If the hostname is too long, it returns a warning and returns the hostname as a string. This prevents the buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code already checks for the hostname length and prevents the buffer overflow. However, it would be beneficial to add a check for the return value of gethostbyname to handle cases where the hostname is not found. This can be done by checking if hp->h_addr_list is NULL after calling gethostbyname. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST."  VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code calls gethostbyname without checking the length of the hostname. This
