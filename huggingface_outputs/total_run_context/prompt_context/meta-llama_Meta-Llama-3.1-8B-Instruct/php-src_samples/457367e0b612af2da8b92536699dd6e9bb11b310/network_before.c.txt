 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability because it uses the gethostbyname function which is affected by the vulnerability. The gethostbyname function is used in line 17 of the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the gethostbyname function with the getaddrinfo function which is not affected by the GHOST vulnerability. The getaddrinfo function is a more modern and secure function for resolving hostnames to IP addresses. The code should be modified to use the getaddrinfo function instead of gethostbyname.
