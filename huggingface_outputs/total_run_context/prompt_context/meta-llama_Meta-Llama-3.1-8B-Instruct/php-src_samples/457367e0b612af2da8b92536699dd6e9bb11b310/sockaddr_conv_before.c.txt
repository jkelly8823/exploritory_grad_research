 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function. This is because the function does not perform any bounds checking on the hostname string, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present in the line where the gethostbyname function is called, which is line 14.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform bounds checking on the hostname string before passing it to the gethostbyname function. This can be done by using a function like strlcpy to ensure that the hostname string does not exceed a certain length. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle errors more robustly, such as by checking the return value of the gethostbyname function and handling any errors that may occur.

CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethost
