 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gethostbyname function, which is a known vulnerability in glibc 2.2 and other 2.x versions before 2.18. This vulnerability can be exploited by passing a specially crafted hostname to the gethostbyname function, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade glibc to a version that is not vulnerable (e.g. 2.18 or later).
2. Use a safer alternative to gethostbyname, such as getaddrinfo.
3. Implement a bounds check on the hostname length to prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-0235
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots function in glibc 2.2, and other 2.x versions before 2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) gethostbyname or (2) gethostbyname2 function, aka "GHOST."  This vulnerability is present in the code sample.  The code sample is vulnerable to
