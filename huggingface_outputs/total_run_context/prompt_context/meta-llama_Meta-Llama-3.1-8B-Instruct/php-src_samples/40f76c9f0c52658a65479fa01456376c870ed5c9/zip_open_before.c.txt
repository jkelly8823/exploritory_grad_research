 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-14107 vulnerability. This is because the _zip_read_eocd64 function in zip_open.c in libzip before 1.3.0 mishandles EOCD records, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation failure in _zip_cdir_grow in zip_dirent.c) via a crafted ZIP archive. The code checks for the presence of the EOCD record, but it does not properly handle the case where the record is not present, leading to a potential denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the libzip library to version 1.3.0 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to handle the case where the EOCD record is not present, such as checking for the presence of the central directory record. 
3. Consider using a more robust library for handling ZIP archives, such as libzip2.  ```python
```python
def check_vulnerability(code):
    # Check for the presence of the _zip_read_eocd64 function
    if "_zip_read_eocd64" in
