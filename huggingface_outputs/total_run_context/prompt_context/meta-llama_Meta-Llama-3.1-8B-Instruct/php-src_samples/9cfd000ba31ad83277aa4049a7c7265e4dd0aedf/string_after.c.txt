 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow due to the calculation of out_len. The variable out_len is a float, but it is being compared to INT_MAX and INT_MIN, which are integers. This can cause the comparison to be incorrect, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the type of out_len to int to prevent the integer overflow.
2. Use a safe integer multiplication function to prevent overflow.
3. Use a safe integer comparison function to prevent overflow.
