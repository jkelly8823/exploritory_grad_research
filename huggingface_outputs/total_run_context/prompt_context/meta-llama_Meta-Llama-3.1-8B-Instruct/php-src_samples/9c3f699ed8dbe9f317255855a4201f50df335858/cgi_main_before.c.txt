 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the calculation of path_translated_len. The calculation does not properly consider operator precedence, which might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted URI. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, where the attacker can manipulate the PATH_TRANSLATED variable to overflow the buffer allocated for path_translated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to calculate the length of path_translated, such as using a library function that handles operator precedence correctly.
2. Use a secure method to allocate memory for path_translated, such as using a memory-safe allocation function.
3. Validate user input to prevent buffer overflow attacks. This can be done by checking the length of PATH_TRANSLATED and PATH_INFO before allocating memory for path_translated. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2008-0599
CVE Description:
The init_request_info function in sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.2.6 does not properly consider operator precedence when calculating the length of PATH_TRANSLATED, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted URI.
