 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any instances of the crypt_des function, which is the specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE description. The code appears to be related to MySQL and does not seem to be using the crypt_des function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any instances of the vulnerable function. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest security patches. Additionally, consider using a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to store passwords securely.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.
