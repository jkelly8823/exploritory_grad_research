 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that uses the crypt_des function. The vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2143 is related to the handling of passwords in the crypt_des function, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that uses the crypt_des function, so there are no recommendations for fixes. However, if this code were to be used in a context where it handles passwords, it would be a good idea to ensure that any password handling code is properly reviewed and tested for vulnerabilities.
