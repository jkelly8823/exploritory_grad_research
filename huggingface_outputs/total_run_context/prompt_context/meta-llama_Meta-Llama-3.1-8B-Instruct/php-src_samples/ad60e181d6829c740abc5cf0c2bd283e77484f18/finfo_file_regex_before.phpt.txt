VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.
Code Sample:
--TEST--
Test finfo_file() function : regex rules
--SKIPIF--
<?php require_once(dirname(__FILE__). '/skipif.inc');?>
--FILE--
<?php
/**
 * Works with the unix file command:
 */

?>
