 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability because it does not properly handle Unicode passwords. The crypt_des function is used in the connect_handshake method, which does not process the complete cleartext password if it contains a 0x80 character. This makes it easier for attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the crypt_des function to properly handle Unicode passwords.
2. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as password salting and stretching. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.
