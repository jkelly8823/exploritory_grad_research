 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for a MySQL driver. It defines various constants for packet sizes, error message sizes, SQL state lengths, and a null SQL state. Upon reviewing the code, there is no indication of the use of the crypt_des function or any related vulnerabilities. The code seems to be focused on defining constants for a MySQL driver, which does not directly relate to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is essential to review the code that uses these constants to ensure that it does not inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using secure password storage mechanisms, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to protect against password-related vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description: 
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
