 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential issue where the chdir() function is called in a CLI SAPI environment, which may cause the current working directory to be changed unexpectedly. This could potentially lead to issues with the getmyinode() function, which relies on the current working directory to function correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using chdir() in a CLI SAPI environment, as it can cause unexpected behavior.
2. Use an absolute path when calling chdir() to ensure the current working directory is changed as expected.
3. Consider using a different approach to achieve the desired functionality, such as using a different function or method that does not rely on the current working directory. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the
