 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the cleartext password when it contains a 0x80 character. This is due to the fact that the code does not process the complete cleartext password, making it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle the cleartext password when it contains a 0x80 character.
2. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to reduce the risk of password cracking.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as password salting and stretching, to further enhance password security.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers
