 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a vulnerability related to the crypt_des function, which is susceptible to a Unicode password attack. The presence of the Unicode character "ç" in the variable $çity triggers this vulnerability. This is because the crypt_des function does not properly handle Unicode characters, making it easier for attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the system to use a more secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2.
2. Ensure that all Unicode characters are properly handled and validated in the password hashing process.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure password hashing functionality, such as PHP's built-in password_hash function.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication
