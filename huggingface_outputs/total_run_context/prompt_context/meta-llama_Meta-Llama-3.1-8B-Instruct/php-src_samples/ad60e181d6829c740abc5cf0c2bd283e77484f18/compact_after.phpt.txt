 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a vulnerability related to the crypt_des function, which is not properly handling the cleartext password. The presence of the 0x80 character in the password string "$Ã§ity  = "San Francisco";" triggers this vulnerability. This makes it easier for attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the crypt_des function to properly handle cleartext passwords containing 0x80 characters.
2. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to mitigate this vulnerability.
3. Ensure that all passwords are properly sanitized and validated before being used in authentication attempts. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended
