 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-2143 vulnerability because it uses the crypt_des function which is not properly handling the cleartext password. The setlocale function is used to set the locale to 'fr_FR.ISO8859-1' which contains a character that can cause the crypt_des function to truncate the password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the crypt_des function to properly handle the cleartext password.
2. Use a more secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2.
3. Avoid using the setlocale function to set the locale to a value that contains characters that can cause the crypt_des function to truncate the password. 
4. Consider using a more secure way to handle passwords, such as using a password hashing library.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes
