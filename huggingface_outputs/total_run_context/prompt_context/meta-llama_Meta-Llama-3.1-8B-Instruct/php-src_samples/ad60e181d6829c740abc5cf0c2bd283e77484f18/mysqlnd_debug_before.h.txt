 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any instances of the suspected vulnerability. The crypt_des function is not used in this code, and the code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to password processing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to follow secure coding practices. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password, as demonstrated by a Unicode password.  The code sample does not appear to be related to password processing or the crypt_des function.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this CVE.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to follow secure coding practices.
