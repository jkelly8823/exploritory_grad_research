 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of strlen() on the func_name variable. If func_name contains a 0x80 character, strlen() will not process the complete cleartext password, making it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access via an authentication attempt with an initial substring of the intended password. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strnlen() to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Validate the input to func_name to ensure it does not contain any 0x80 characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and compare passwords, such as using a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2143
CVE Description:
The crypt_des (aka DES-based crypt) function in FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p2, as used in PHP, PostgreSQL, and other products, does not process the complete cleartext password if this password contains a 0x80 character, which makes it easier for context-dependent
