 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17, 24
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. The directive is not properly reset to its original value after the importing of environment variables, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the magic_quotes_gpc directive is properly reset to its original value after the importing of environment variables.
2. Implement a secure method to handle environment variables, such as using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
3. Regularly update and patch PHP to ensure that the latest security vulnerabilities are addressed. */ VULNERABLE: YES
