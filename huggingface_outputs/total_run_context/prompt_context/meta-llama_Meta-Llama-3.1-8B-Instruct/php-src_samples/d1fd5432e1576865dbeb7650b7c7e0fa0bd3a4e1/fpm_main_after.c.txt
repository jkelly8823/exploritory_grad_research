 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7, 12-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. When importing environment variables, the code temporarily disables magic_quotes_gpc, but it does not properly restore it afterwards. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the environment variables.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the magic_quotes_gpc directive is properly restored after importing environment variables.
2. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Regularly update PHP to the latest version, as this vulnerability has been patched in PHP 5.3.10. 4. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from reaching the database. 5. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. 7. Consider using a secure coding framework or library to help prevent SQL injection attacks. 8. Ensure that all environment variables are properly sanitized before using them in database queries. 9. Consider using a database abstraction layer
