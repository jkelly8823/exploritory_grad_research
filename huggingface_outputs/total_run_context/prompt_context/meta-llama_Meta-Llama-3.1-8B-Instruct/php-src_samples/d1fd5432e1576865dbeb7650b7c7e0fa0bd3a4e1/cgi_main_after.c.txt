 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7, 12-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the temporary disabling of magic_quotes_gpc during the importing of environment variables. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via a crafted request. The vulnerability is present in the lines where magic_quotes_gpc is altered and reset.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the temporary disabling of magic_quotes_gpc and instead use a more secure method to handle environment variables.
2. Consider using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Regularly update PHP to the latest version to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched. 4. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks. 5. Use a secure coding practice to handle user input and prevent SQL injection attacks. 6. Use a library or framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks. 7. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 8. Validate user input to prevent SQL injection attacks. 9. Use a secure connection (HTTPS) to prevent SQL injection attacks. 10. Regularly test and audit the application to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks
