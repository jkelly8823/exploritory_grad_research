 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17, 24, 31, 38
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the improper handling of the magic_quotes_gpc directive. The directive is not properly reset to its original value after being temporarily changed, which allows an attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks via a crafted request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the magic_quotes_gpc directive is properly reset to its original value after being temporarily changed.
2. Implement a secure method to handle environment variables to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Regularly update PHP to the latest version to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched. */ VULNERABLE: YES
