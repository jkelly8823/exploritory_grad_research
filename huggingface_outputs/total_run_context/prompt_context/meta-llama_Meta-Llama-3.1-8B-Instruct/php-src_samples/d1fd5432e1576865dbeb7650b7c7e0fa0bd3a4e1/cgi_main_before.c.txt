 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the temporary disabling of magic_quotes_gpc. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the environment variables. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the magic_quotes_gpc directive is altered and restored.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the temporary disabling of magic_quotes_gpc and instead use a more secure method to handle environment variables.
2. Consider using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Regularly update PHP to the latest version to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```bash
