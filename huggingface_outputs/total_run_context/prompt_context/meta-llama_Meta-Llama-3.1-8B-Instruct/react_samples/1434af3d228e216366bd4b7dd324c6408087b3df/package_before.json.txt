 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is a package.json file, which is not directly related to the vulnerability. However, the vulnerability is related to the ip package, which is used in the dependencies of the package.json file. The ip package is used to handle IP addresses, and the vulnerability is related to improper categorization of certain IP addresses as globally routable. This suggests that the vulnerability is present in the code that uses the ip package, but the provided code sample does not contain any code that uses the ip package directly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code that uses the ip package to ensure that it properly handles IP addresses.
- Update the ip package to the latest version (2.0.2 or higher) to ensure that the vulnerability is fixed.
- Consider using a more secure library for handling IP addresses.
