 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the usage of an insecure regular expression within the word-wrap package. This vulnerability is present in all versions of the package, including the ones specified in the code sample (1.2.3 and 1.0.0). The insecure regular expression is used in the word-wrap package to perform word wrapping, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the word-wrap package to a version that is not vulnerable to ReDoS, such as version 1.2.4 or later.
2. Use a secure regular expression library, such as regexu or regexu-core, to perform word wrapping.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from being passed to the word-wrap function.
