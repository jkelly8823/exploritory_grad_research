 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the usage of an insecure regular expression within the word-wrap package. This vulnerability is present in all versions of the package, including the ones specified in the code sample (1.2.5 and 1.0.0).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the word-wrap package to a version that is not vulnerable to ReDoS, such as version 1.2.4 or later.
2. Use a secure regular expression library or function to replace the insecure regular expression used in the word-wrap package.
3. Consider using a package like `string-width` or `auto-wrap` which are known to be secure and do not have this vulnerability.
