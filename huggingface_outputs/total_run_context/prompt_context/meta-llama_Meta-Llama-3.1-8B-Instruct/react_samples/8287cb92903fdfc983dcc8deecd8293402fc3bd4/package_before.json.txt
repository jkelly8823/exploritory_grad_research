 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described issue. The vulnerability is specific to PostCSS parsing external untrusted CSS, which is not present in this code snippet. The code snippet only includes dependencies and resolutions, but no actual CSS code that could be parsed by PostCSS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to ensure that any external CSS code is properly sanitized and validated before being processed by PostCSS. This can be achieved by using a library like `postcss-safe-parser` which provides a safer way to parse CSS. Additionally, it is recommended to keep dependencies up-to-date, especially for critical dependencies like PostCSS.
