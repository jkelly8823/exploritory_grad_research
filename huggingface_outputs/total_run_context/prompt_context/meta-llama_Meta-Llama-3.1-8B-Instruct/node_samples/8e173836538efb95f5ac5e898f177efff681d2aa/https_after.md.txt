 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the Node.js version or the `server.requestTimeout` variable. However, based on the provided vulnerability list, it is possible that the code is vulnerable to the HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks if it is running on a version of Node.js prior to 14.11.0. This is because the `server.requestTimeout` variable is only available in Node.js version 14.11.0 and later, and its default value is set to 0, which means that the server will not timeout requests by default.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the version of Node.js being used and update it to the latest version (14.11.0 or later) to prevent potential DoS attacks.
2. Set a reasonable timeout value for the `server.requestTimeout` variable to prevent prolonged requests from consuming server resources. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-8251
CVE Description:
Node.js < 14.11.0 is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept
