 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission. This is because the `server.requestTimeout` property is set to `0` by default, which means that the server will wait indefinitely for a response from the client. An attacker can exploit this by sending a delayed request, causing the server to consume increasing amounts of resources and eventually leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Set a reasonable timeout value for the `server.requestTimeout` property to prevent denial of service attacks.
* Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent delayed requests, such as a rate limiting system or a timeout for incoming requests.
