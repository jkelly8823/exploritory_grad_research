 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically a header file containing error code definitions. The code does not contain any user-written code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. The vulnerability descriptions provided (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786) are related to X.509 certificate verification and name constraint checking, which is not present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are provided for this code snippet as it does not contain any user-written code that could introduce vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, proper error handling and input validation should be implemented in any user-written code that interacts with the OpenSSL library.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a
