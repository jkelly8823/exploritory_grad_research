 

VULNERABLE: YES/NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers/None
EXPLANATION:
Provide a more detailed explanation of your analysis here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include recommended fixes for this code.

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code sample appears to be a preprocessor directive that checks for certain compiler and platform conditions, and does not contain any code that could be executed or manipulated by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the code sample is a preprocessor directive and does not contain any actual code that could be executed. It is likely that the code sample is intended to be used in conjunction with other code that is not shown here. Therefore, it is recommended to review the surrounding code to ensure that it is not vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities.  Additionally, it is recommended to consider using a more modern and secure way of handling certificate verification, such as using a library that is designed to handle certificate verification securely.  This could include using a library such as OpenSSL, but
