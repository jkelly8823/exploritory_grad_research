 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be related to OpenSSL implementations for various digest algorithms and encoding/decoding functions, but it does not include any code that performs X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any potential security issues that may not be related to the specific vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
