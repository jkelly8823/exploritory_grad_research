 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the way the `OPENSSL_VERSION_STR` macro is defined, which can lead to an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) being written to the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `OPENSSL_VERSION_STR` macro to use a fixed-length buffer to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer method to concatenate strings, such as using `snprintf` or `strcat_s` to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve version information, such as using a database or a configuration file. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate
