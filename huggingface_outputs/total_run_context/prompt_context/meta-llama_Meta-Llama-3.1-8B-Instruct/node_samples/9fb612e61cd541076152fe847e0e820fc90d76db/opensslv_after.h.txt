 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is the OpenSSL library version 3.0.7, which is the fixed version for the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities. The code does not contain any vulnerable code, as it is the patched version.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as the code is already patched and secure. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are addressed.  The code sample is a library and not a direct application, so it is not directly vulnerable to the CVEs. However, any application that uses this library should ensure that they are using the patched version.  The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVEs, but any application that uses this library should ensure that they are using the patched version.
