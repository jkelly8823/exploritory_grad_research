 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the specific areas where the vulnerabilities CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 are present. The code appears to be a mix of assembly instructions and ARMv8-A instructions, which are used for cryptographic operations. However, there is no indication of buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities related to the CVEs in question.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the code may benefit from a review of its cryptographic operations to ensure they are properly implemented and secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker
