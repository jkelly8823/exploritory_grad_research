 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol. This is because the code is using url.parse() to determine the URL hostname, which can be spoofed by using a mixed case "javascript:" protocol.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure method to determine the URL hostname, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue. Alternatively, use a secure protocol such as HTTPS instead of HTTP. Also, ensure that security decisions are not made based on the hostname.

CVE_ID:CVE-2018-12123
CVE Description: Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol: If a Node.js application is using url.parse() to determine the URL hostname, that hostname can be spoofed by using a mixed case "javascript:" (e.g. "javAscript:") protocol (other protocols are not affected). If security decisions are made about the URL based on the hostname, they may
