 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to hostname spoofing due to the use of url.parse() to determine the URL hostname. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the hostname can be spoofed by using a mixed case "javascript:" protocol. This can lead to incorrect security decisions being made about the URL based on the hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to version 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0, or 11.3.0 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a more secure method to determine the URL hostname, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to hostname spoofing. 
3. Implement additional security checks to verify the hostname before making security decisions. 4. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the use of certain protocols and sources. 5. Regularly update and patch Node.js to ensure that the latest security fixes are applied. 6. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent hostname spoofing attacks. 7. Implement a secure protocol for handling URLs, such as using HTTPS.
