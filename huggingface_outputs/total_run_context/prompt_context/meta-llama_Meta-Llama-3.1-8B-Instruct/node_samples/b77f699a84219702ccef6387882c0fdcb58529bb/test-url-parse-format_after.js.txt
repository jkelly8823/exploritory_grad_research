 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol. This is because the code does not properly handle mixed case protocols, allowing an attacker to spoof the hostname by using a mixed case "javascript:" protocol.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0, or 11.3.0 or later).
2. Implement a custom URL parser that properly handles mixed case protocols.
3. Use a library that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as a library that uses a case-insensitive protocol check. 
4. Validate the URL hostname before making any security decisions based on it. 
5. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as HTTPS. 
6. Use a URL validation library to ensure that the URL is properly formatted and does not contain any malicious characters. 
7. Regularly update Node.js and other dependencies to ensure that you have the latest security patches. 
8. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks
