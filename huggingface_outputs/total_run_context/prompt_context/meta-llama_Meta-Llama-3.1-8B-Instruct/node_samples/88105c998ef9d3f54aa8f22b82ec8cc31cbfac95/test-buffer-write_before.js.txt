 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-12115 vulnerability because it uses the `Buffer#write()` method with the `encoding` parameter, which can be abused to write outside of the bounds of a single `Buffer`. The `assert.throws()` statement is attempting to test the behavior of `Buffer#write()` with a specific encoding, but it does not properly handle the case where the encoding is not recognized by Node.js.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a recognized encoding when calling `Buffer#write()`, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.
2. Use a try-catch block to catch and handle any errors that may occur when calling `Buffer#write()`. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and make the code more robust.
