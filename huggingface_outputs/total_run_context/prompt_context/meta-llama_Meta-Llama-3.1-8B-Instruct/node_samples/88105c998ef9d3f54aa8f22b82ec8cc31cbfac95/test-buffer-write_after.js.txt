 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14, 17-20, 23-24
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the 'ucs2' encoding in the Buffer.write() method. This vulnerability is a result of a miscalculation of the maximum length of the input bytes to be written, which can cause writes to occur outside of the bounds of a single Buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can corrupt the process.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the 'ucs2' encoding in the Buffer.write() method.
2. Use a safer encoding, such as 'utf8', which does not have the same buffer overflow vulnerability.
3. Use a library that provides a safer way to write to buffers, such as the'safe-buffer' library. 
4. Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue, such as 6.14.4, 8.11.4, or 10.9.0. 
5. Use a code analysis tool to identify and fix similar vulnerabilities in the codebase.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
