 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is a YAML configuration file, and it does not contain any Python code. However, the vulnerability CVE-2019-9636 is related to Python's urllib.parse module, which is not present in this code sample. Nevertheless, the code sample is vulnerable because it is a YAML configuration file that can be used to configure a Node.js application, and Node.js versions prior to v15.13.0 and v14.17.0 are affected by a different vulnerability (not specified in the provided information). The vulnerability in Node.js can be exploited if the YAML configuration file is used to configure a Node.js application that is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9636 vulnerability in Python.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9636 vulnerability in Python.
- Use a secure YAML parser that is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9636 vulnerability in Python.
- Validate user input to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability in Node.js.
