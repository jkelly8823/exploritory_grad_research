 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9636. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of Unicode encoding during NFKC normalization. The code uses the toASCII function to convert non-ASCII characters in the hostname to their punycode representation. However, it does not properly handle the case where the hostname contains forbidden host characters. This can lead to information disclosure, as the hostname may be cached against a different host than when parsed correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle forbidden host characters. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the hostname does not contain any forbidden host characters before calling toASCII.
2. Consider using a more robust library for URL parsing and normalization, such as the WHATWG URL API. This can help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 
3. Ensure that the code is updated to the latest version of Node.js, which includes the fix for CVE-2019-9636. 

Note: The lines 34-35 are the lines where the hostname is checked for forbidden host characters and the toASCII function is called.
