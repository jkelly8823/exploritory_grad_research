 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a YAML configuration file for Node.js, describing changes to the URL parsing behavior. It does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9636 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to improper handling of Unicode encoding in Python's urllib.parse.urlsplit and urllib.parse.urlparse functions, which is not relevant to this Node.js configuration file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is a configuration file and does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to ensure that any Node.js code using URL parsing is up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Additionally, consider using a secure URL parsing library or function to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
