VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, SQL, lookups, and messages, are vulnerable to a remote code execution when not properly restricted. A specific pattern in a configuration file allows an attacker to inject data from JNDI, which can lead to remote code execution.

Code Sample:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const log4j = require('log4js');
  log4j.configure({
