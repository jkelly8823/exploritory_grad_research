 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9636 vulnerability. The code is written in JavaScript and appears to be testing the behavior of the `url.parse()` function with specially crafted URLs. However, the code is designed to test for the presence of invalid URLs, not to exploit any vulnerabilities in the `url.parse()` function. The code is also using the `normalize()` method to check for Unicode NFKD characters, which is a defensive measure to prevent the exploitation of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to regularly review the code for any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of defensive measures such as Unicode normalization can help prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-9636.  The code is also using the `assert.throws()` method to test for expected errors, which is a good practice to ensure that the code behaves as expected in different scenarios.  The code is also using the `includes()` method to check for the
