 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9636. The vulnerability is present in the `toASCII` function which is used to punycoded representation of the hostname. The function is called with `true` as the second argument, which enables lenient mode. This can lead to incorrect parsing of URLs and potential information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `toASCII` function to use the `idna` library instead of the built-in `punycode` library. This will ensure that the function is using the latest and most secure implementation.
2. Remove the `true` argument from the `toASCII` function call. This will disable lenient mode and prevent potential information disclosure.
3. Consider adding additional validation and sanitization of the hostname to prevent potential attacks.
