 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-23918 privilege escalation vulnerability. This is because the code uses process.mainModule.require() to access modules, which can bypass the experimental Permissions feature in Node.js. This is a critical vulnerability that can allow an attacker to access non-authorized modules and potentially escalate their privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (>=19.6.1, >=18.14.1, >=16.19.1, >=14.21.3).
2. Disable the experimental Permissions feature by removing the --experimental-policy flag when running Node.js.
3. Use a secure module resolution mechanism, such as the built-in require() function, instead of process.mainModule.require(). 
4. Implement additional security measures, such as access control lists or role-based access control, to prevent unauthorized access to modules.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
