 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HPE_CHUNK_EXTENSIONS_OVERFLOW and HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH errors. This is because the HTTP parsing will abort without a request or response object being created, and an Error with this code will be emitted if more than 16 KiB of data is received for a chunk extensions or if the content length is unexpected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a check to ensure that the received data does not exceed the maximum allowed size for chunk extensions.
- Validate the content length to ensure it matches the actual content received.
- Consider implementing a mechanism to handle unexpected content lengths, such as buffering or streaming the content. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-24806
CVE Description:
libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `get
