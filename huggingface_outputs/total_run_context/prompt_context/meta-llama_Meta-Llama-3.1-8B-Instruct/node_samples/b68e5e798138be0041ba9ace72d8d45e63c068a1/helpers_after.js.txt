 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32002 and CVE-2023-32006 vulnerabilities. The use of `lazyModule()` function to load the `Module` object can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition for a given module. This is because the `lazyModule()` function is not properly secured and can be exploited to load arbitrary modules.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `lazyModule()` function and load the `Module` object directly from the `internal/modules/cjs/loader` module.
2. Implement proper security checks to ensure that only authorized modules are loaded.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to load modules, such as using a module loader that enforces policy restrictions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
