 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32002 and CVE-2023-32006 vulnerabilities because it uses the `Module._load()` and `module.constructor.createRequire()` methods, which can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition for a given module. This is a concern because it allows an attacker to load arbitrary modules, potentially leading to code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the `Module._load()` and `module.constructor.createRequire()` methods directly. Instead, use the `require()` function provided by the `internal/bootstrap/realm` module to load modules.
2. Ensure that the policy mechanism is properly configured and enforced to prevent unauthorized module loading.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed modules or using a module loader that enforces policy constraints.
