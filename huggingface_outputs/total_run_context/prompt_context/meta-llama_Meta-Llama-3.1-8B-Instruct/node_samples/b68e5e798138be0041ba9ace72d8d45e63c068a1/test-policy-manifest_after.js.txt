 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32002 and CVE-2023-32006 vulnerabilities due to the use of `Module._load()` and `module.constructor.createRequire()` respectively. These functions can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition for a given module. The code is using the experimental policy mechanism, which is affected by these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the `Module._load()` function and instead use the `require()` function to load modules.
2. Avoid using the `module.constructor.createRequire()` function and instead use the `require()` function to load modules.
3. Remove the experimental policy mechanism and use the standard policy mechanism instead.
4. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
