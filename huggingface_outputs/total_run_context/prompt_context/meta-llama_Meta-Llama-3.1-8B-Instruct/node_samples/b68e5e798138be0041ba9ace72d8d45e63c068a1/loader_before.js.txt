 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32002 vulnerability because it uses the `Module._load()` function which can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition for a given module. This is a critical vulnerability that affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x, and 20.x.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability.
2. Disable the experimental policy mechanism if it is not being used.
3. Use a secure require function that does not bypass the policy mechanism.
