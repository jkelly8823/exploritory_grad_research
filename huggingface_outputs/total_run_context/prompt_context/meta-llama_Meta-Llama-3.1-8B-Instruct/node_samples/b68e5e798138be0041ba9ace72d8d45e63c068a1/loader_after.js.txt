 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32002 vulnerability because it uses the `Module.prototype.constructor` property to bypass the policy mechanism. This allows modules outside of the policy.json definition for a given module to be required.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `__proto__: null` property from the `ObjectDefineProperty` call to prevent the bypass of the policy mechanism.
2. Use the `policy()` function to validate the module before requiring it.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to require modules, such as using a whitelist of allowed modules. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not use the `module.constructor.createRequire()` method, which is the method that bypasses the policy mechanism in the CVE-2023-32006 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. 

Note: The code sample provided does not contain any instances of the `module.constructor.createRequire()` method, so it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32006 vulnerability.
