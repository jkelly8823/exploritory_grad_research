 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the HPE_CHUNK_EXTENSIONS_OVERFLOW vulnerability. This occurs when too much data is received for a chunk extensions, which can be exploited by malicious or malconfigured clients. The code checks if more than 16 KiB of data is received, but it does not provide any further details on how to handle this situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Increase the buffer size to handle larger chunk extensions.
- Implement a mechanism to handle chunk extensions that exceed the buffer size, such as truncating or discarding the excess data.
- Consider adding a limit on the maximum size of chunk extensions to prevent abuse. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-24806
CVE Description:
libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo
