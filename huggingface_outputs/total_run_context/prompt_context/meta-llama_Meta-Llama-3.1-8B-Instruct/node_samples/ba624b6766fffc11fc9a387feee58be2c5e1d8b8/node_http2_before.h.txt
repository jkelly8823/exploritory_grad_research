 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code defines a set of constants for session states and a function pointer type for getting settings, but it does not involve any HTTP/2 protocol implementation or data buffering. Therefore, it does not seem to be susceptible to the described vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential security issues and consider using secure coding practices.  ```bash
