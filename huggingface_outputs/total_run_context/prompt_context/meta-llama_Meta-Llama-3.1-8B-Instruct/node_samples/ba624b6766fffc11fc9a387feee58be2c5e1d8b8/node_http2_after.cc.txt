 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker can open the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint, but leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the internal data buffering, such as a queue size limit or a timeout for pending writes.
2. Regularly check the TCP window size and adjust the HTTP/2 window size accordingly to prevent unconstrained buffering.
3. Consider using a more efficient data buffering mechanism, such as a ring buffer or a memory pool, to reduce memory usage and improve performance. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9511
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple
