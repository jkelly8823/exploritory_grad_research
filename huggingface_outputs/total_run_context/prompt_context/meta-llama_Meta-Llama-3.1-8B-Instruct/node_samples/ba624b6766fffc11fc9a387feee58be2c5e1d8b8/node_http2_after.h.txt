 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code defines a set of constants for session states and a function pointer type for getting settings, but it does not contain any code that could be exploited to manipulate window sizes, stream priorities, or internal data buffering.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues related to memory management or other security concerns. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9511
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9517
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial
