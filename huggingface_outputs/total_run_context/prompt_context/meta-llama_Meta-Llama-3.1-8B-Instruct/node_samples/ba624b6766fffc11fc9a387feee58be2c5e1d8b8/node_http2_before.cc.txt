EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker can open the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint, but leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both. This is evident in the MaybeStopReading() function where it checks if the session wants to read and if so, it stops reading. However, it does not check if the TCP window is closed, allowing the attacker to manipulate the internal data buffering.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure the TCP window is not closed before allowing the session to read.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the internal data buffering, such as a queue size limit.
3. Consider using a more robust and secure way to handle HTTP/2 sessions, such as using a library that has built-in security features.  ```python
