 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (application crash) due to the lack of input validation for the number of function parameters. This allows an attacker to craft malicious JavaScript code that can cause the application to crash. The vulnerability is related to the Google V8 engine, which is used in Google Chrome, and is identified by CVE-2013-2632.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation for the number of function parameters to prevent excessive values.
2. Consider using a more robust hash function to construct a hashable id for the function parameters.
3. Review the code to ensure that it can handle unexpected input values without crashing. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2632
CVE Description:
Google V8 before 3.17.13, as used in Google Chrome before 27.0.1444.3, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code, as demonstrated by the Bejeweled game.  This vulnerability is related to the parsing of function parameters.  The code provided does not appear to be
