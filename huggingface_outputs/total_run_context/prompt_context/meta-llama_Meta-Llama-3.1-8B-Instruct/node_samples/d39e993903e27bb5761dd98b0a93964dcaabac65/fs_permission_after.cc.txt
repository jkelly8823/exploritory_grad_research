 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of substr() function without checking the length of the string. If the input string is very large, it can cause the string to exceed the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the std::string::find() function instead of substr() to check for the presence of the prefix, and then use std::string::erase() to remove the prefix.
2. Consider using a safer method to remove the prefix, such as using std::string::replace() or std::string::substr() with a length check.
3. Always check the length of the string before performing operations that may cause buffer overflows.
