CVE Description:
Node.js before 4.8.5, 6.x before 6.11.5, and 8.x before 8.8.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uncaught exception and crash) by leveraging a change in the zlib module 1.2.9 making 8 an invalid value for the windowBits parameter.

const input = fs.readFileSync('input.txt', 'utf8');
const output = zlib.deflateSync(input, { windowBits: 8 });
console.log(output.toString());
