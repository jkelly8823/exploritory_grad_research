 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the use of llhttp < v2.1.4 and < v6.0.6. The parser in llhttp accepts requests with a space (SP) right after the header name before the colon, and the parse function ignores chunk extensions when parsing the body of chunked requests. This can lead to HRS under certain conditions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade llhttp to version 2.1.4 or later, or version 6.0.6 or later.
- Consider using a more secure parser that does not have these vulnerabilities. 
- Ensure that the code is properly configured to handle chunked requests and prevent HRS.
