VULNERABILITY LIST:

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential command injection attack. The `child_process.spawnSync` function is used to execute the `autocannon` executable with the `-h` flag. However, the executable path is determined by the `process.platform` variable, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious commands. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a whitelist approach to validate the executable path. You can use a library like `path` to normalize the path and ensure it only contains allowed characters. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to execute the command, such as using `child_process.execFileSync` with a validated executable path.
