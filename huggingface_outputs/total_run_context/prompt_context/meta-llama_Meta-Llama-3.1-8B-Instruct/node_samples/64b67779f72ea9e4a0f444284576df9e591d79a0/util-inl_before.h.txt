VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the strcpy function without bounds checking. The strcpy function copies the source string to the destination string without checking the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is larger than the destination buffer. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the strncpy function instead of strcpy to prevent buffer overflows. The strncpy function copies at most n characters from the source string to the destination string, preventing buffer overflows.
2. Check the size of the destination buffer before copying the source string to ensure that it is large enough to hold the source string.
3. Consider using a safer function like strlcpy or strlcat to copy strings, as they provide additional safety features like bounds checking.
