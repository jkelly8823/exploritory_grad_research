VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the lack of proper argument escaping when spawning batch files on Windows. This is because the `IsWindowsBatchFile` function does not properly escape the arguments, which can lead to command injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `CreateProcess` API with the `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` flag to prevent the creation of a new window for the batch file.
2. Use the `CreateProcess` API with the `CREATE_SUSPENDED` flag to prevent the execution of the batch file until it is explicitly resumed.
3. Use a secure method to escape the arguments, such as using the `ShellExecute` function with the `SW_HIDE` flag to prevent the creation of a new window.
4. Consider using a more secure method to spawn processes, such as using the `CreateProcess` API with the `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` and `CREATE_SUSPENDED` flags, and then using the `ResumeThread` function to resume the execution of the process. 

Note: The above recommendations are based on the assumption that the code is intended to spawn batch files on Windows. If the code is intended
