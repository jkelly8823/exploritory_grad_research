VULNERABILITY LIST:

1. **Insecure Use of child_process.spawnSync()**: The code uses child_process.spawnSync() to execute a command, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the command is malicious. This is because child_process.spawnSync() does not provide any protection against command injection attacks.
2. **Insecure Use of child_process.spawn()**: The code uses child_process.spawn() to execute a command, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if the command is malicious. This is because child_process.spawn() does not provide any protection against command injection attacks.
3. **Insecure Use of child_process.spawnSync() with user input**: The code uses child_process.spawnSync() to execute a command with user input (options.headers[field]), which can lead to a command injection attack if the user input is not properly sanitized.
4. **Insecure Use of child_process.spawn() with user input**: The code uses child_process.spawn() to execute a command with
