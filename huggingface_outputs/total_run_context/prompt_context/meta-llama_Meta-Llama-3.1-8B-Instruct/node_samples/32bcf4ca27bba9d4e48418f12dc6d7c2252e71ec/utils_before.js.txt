 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the insufficient patching of CVE-2023-30584. The permission model, which is an experimental feature, relies on the absolute path for the fs_permission. However, the implementation does not protect itself against the application overwriting built-in utility functions with user-defined implementations. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path resolution, potentially leading to a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement the path.resolve function on the C++ side as planned in the TODO comment.
2. Ensure that the permission model is properly patched to prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Consider removing the permission model as an experimental feature until it is fully stable and secure. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```
