 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the modification of the `path.resolve` function. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path resolution process, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Avoid modifying built-in utility functions like `path.resolve`. Instead, use the original implementation or create a custom function to achieve the desired behavior.
2.  Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.
3.  Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a library like `path.posix` or `path.win32`, which provides a safer way to work with paths.
4.  Regularly review and update your code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security best practices.  ```javascript
const { resolve } = path;
path.resolve = (s) => s;
```  This line of code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. It allows an attacker to manipulate the path resolution process, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories. To fix this, you can use the original implementation of `path.resolve` or create a custom function to
