VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the concatenation of user-defined environment variables with hardcoded paths. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside the intended directory. The use of `path.resolve()` does not mitigate this issue, as it can still be tricked into resolving to an unintended path. The code also attempts to check for access denied errors, but this is insufficient to prevent the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a library like `path.join()` to safely join paths, which will prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize user-defined environment variables to prevent manipulation.
3. Consider using a more robust permission model, such as the one provided by the `fs` module, to check for access permissions.
4. Remove the use of `path.resolve()` and instead use `path.join()` to construct paths.
5. Implement additional security measures, such as logging and monitoring, to detect and prevent potential attacks.  ```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const blockedFolder = process.env.B
