 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a YAML comment block that describes changes to the Node.js codebase, including the introduction of a fix for CVE-2021-44532. There is no executable code in this sample that could be vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the code sample is a YAML comment block and does not contain any executable code. If you are writing code that uses Node.js, you should ensure that you are using a version that is not vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities. Specifically, you should use Node.js 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later. You can check the version of Node.js you are using by running `node -v` in your terminal. If you are using an earlier version, you should update to a version that is not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities.
