 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44531, CVE-2021-44532, CVE-2021-44533, and CVE-2022-21824 vulnerabilities. The code is based on Node.js versions that are affected by these vulnerabilities, specifically v17.3.1, v16.13.2, v14.18.3, and v12.22.9. These versions are known to have issues with Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, multi-value Relative Distinguished Names, and prototype pollution in the console.table() function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by these vulnerabilities, such as v17.4.0 or later.
- Use the --security-revert command-line option to revert the security fixes for CVE-2021-44531 and CVE-2021-44532 if necessary.
- Avoid using user-controlled input in the properties parameter of the console.table() function to prevent prototype pollution. 
- Consider using a secure alternative to console.table() if possible.
