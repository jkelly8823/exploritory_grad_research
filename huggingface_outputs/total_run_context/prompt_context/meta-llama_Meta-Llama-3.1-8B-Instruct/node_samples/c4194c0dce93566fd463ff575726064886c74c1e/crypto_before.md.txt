 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a YAML comment block, which is not executable code and therefore cannot introduce any vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to any of the listed vulnerabilities.  It is simply a comment block.  However, if you are using Node.js, ensure that you are running a version that is not vulnerable to the listed CVEs.  If you are using a version that is vulnerable, update to a version that is not.  If you are using a version that is not vulnerable, ensure that you are not using any third-party code that may be vulnerable.  Additionally, ensure that you are not using any code that may be vulnerable to the CVEs listed.  Finally, ensure that you are following best practices for secure coding.  This includes ensuring that you are using secure protocols, validating user input, and using secure coding practices.  This will help to prevent vulnerabilities in your code.  If you are unsure about how to secure your code, consider consulting with a security expert.  They can help you to
