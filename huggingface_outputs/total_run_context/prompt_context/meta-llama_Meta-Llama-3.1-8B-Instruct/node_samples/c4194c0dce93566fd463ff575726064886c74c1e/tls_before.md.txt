 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample indicates that it is using Node.js versions v16.13.2, v14.18.3, and v12.22.9. These versions are affected by the vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44531, CVE-2021-44532, and CVE-2021-44533, as mentioned in the vulnerability list. However, the code sample does not contain any specific code that would trigger these vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, since the code is using affected versions of Node.js, it is still vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by these vulnerabilities, such as v17.3.1 or later.
- If updating Node.js is not feasible, consider using the --security-revert command-line option to revert the security fixes for these vulnerabilities. However, this is not recommended as it may leave the system vulnerable to other security issues. 
- Review and update any third-party code that uses Node.js's ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects to prevent potential attacks. 
- Consider using a more secure alternative to the "console.table()" function, such as a custom implementation that does not
