 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2020-11080 due to the lack of the `maxSettings` option. This option was added in version 14.4.0 to prevent denial of service attacks by limiting the number of settings entries in an HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame. Since the code sample is using version 13.0.0, it does not have this protection and is therefore vulnerable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to version 14.4.0 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- Implement the `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback to drop connections with large settings entries, as described in the workaround for CVE-2020-11080.
