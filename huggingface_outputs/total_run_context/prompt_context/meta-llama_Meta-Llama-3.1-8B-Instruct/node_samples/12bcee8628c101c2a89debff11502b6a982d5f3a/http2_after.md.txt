 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2020-11080 due to the lack of the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback. This callback is necessary to prevent the CPU from spiking at 100% when receiving an overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback to handle large SETTINGS frame payloads. This can be done by checking the number of settings entries in the received frame and dropping the connection if it exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 32). This will prevent the CPU from spiking at 100% and mitigate the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-8172
CVE Description:
TLS session reuse can lead to host certificate verification bypass in node version < 12.18.0 and < 14.4.0.
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-11080
CVE Description:
In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of
