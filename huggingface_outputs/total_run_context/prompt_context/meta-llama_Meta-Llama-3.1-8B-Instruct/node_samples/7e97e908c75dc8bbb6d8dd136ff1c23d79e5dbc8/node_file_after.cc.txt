 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32005 due to the experimental permission model being used in Node.js 20. The THROW_IF_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS function is called to check for permissions, but it does not restrict file stats through the fs.statfs API, allowing malicious actors to retrieve stats from files they do not have explicit read access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as Node.js 22 or later.
2. Disable the experimental permission model by removing the --allow-fs-read flag.
3. Implement additional permission checks to restrict file stats through the fs.statfs API. This may involve using a more secure permission model or implementing custom permission checks. 4. Consider using a secure alternative to the experimental permission model, such as the built-in permission model in Node.js. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 6. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 7. Implement a secure coding practice, such as code reviews and testing, to ensure
