 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32005 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20, which is affected by this flaw. The code is attempting to use the `fs.statfs` API to retrieve file stats, which is not restricted by the permission model. This allows malicious actors to retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as Node.js 22 or later.
2. Disable the experimental permission model by removing the `--allow-fs-read` flag.
3. Use a secure alternative to the `fs.statfs` API, such as the `fs.stat` API, which is restricted by the permission model. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-32005
CVE Description:
