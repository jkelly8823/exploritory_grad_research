 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32005 vulnerability because it uses the `fs.statfs` API to retrieve file stats without proper permission checks. The `fs.statfs` call is made without any checks to ensure that the file exists or that the user has the necessary permissions to access the file. This allows an attacker to retrieve file stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the `fs.access` method to check for file existence and permissions before attempting to retrieve file stats.
2. Use the `fs.stat` method instead of `fs.statfs` to retrieve file stats, as it performs permission checks.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a library that provides secure file access, like `fs-extra`.
