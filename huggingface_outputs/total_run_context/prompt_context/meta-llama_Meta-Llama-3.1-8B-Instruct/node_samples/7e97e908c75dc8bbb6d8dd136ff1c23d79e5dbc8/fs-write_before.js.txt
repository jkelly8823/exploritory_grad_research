 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32005 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20, which is affected by this flaw. The line `permission: 'FileSystemWrite',` is the specific line that introduces this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend upgrading to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this flaw, such as Node.js 22 or later. Alternatively, you can disable the experimental permission model by removing the `--allow-fs-read` flag. If you must use the experimental permission model, ensure that you are using a version of Node.js that has addressed this vulnerability. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as file access controls, to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.  ```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'example.txt');

fs.access(filePath, fs.constants.R_OK, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('File not accessible');
  } else {
    console.log('File is accessible');
