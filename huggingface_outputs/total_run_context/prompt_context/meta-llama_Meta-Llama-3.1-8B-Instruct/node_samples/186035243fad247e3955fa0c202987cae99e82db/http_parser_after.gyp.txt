 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the large HTTP headers. The HTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE is set to 8192, which is less than the maximum allowed size. This can cause the HTTP server to abort from heap allocation failure when receiving large HTTP headers. The condition for Windows OS is also vulnerable as it sets HTTP_PARSER_STRICT to 1, which can lead to DoS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the HTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE to a larger value, such as 65536, to prevent DoS attacks.
2. Set HTTP_PARSER_STRICT to 0 for all platforms to prevent DoS attacks.
3. Consider using a load balancer or other proxy layer to mitigate DoS attacks.
