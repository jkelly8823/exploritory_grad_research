 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the potential for large HTTP headers. The code creates a large number of headers with values up to 100, which can cause the HTTP server to abort from heap allocation failure. This is a known vulnerability in Node.js versions prior to 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0, and 11.3.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0, or 11.3.0 or later).
2. Implement a load balancer or other proxy layer to mitigate the risk of DoS attacks.
3. Limit the number of headers created and their values to prevent excessive memory allocation.
