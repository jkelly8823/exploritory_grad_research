VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the `fs.openAsBlob()` function, which is the specific function that bypasses the experimental permission model. The code sample appears to be a part of a larger implementation, but it does not directly address the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-30583.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Review the codebase to ensure that the `fs.openAsBlob()` function is not being used in a way that bypasses the experimental permission model. If it is, consider refactoring the code to use a different approach that does not rely on this function. Additionally, ensure that the `--allow-fs-read` flag is not being used in a way that could potentially bypass the permission model.
