VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not directly implement the `fs.openAsBlob()` API. However, it does call `createBlobFromFilePath()` which might be a part of the implementation of `fs.openAsBlob()`. The code snippet does not contain the missing check for the experimental permission model. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described flaw.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the implementation of `createBlobFromFilePath()` to ensure it correctly handles the experimental permission model.
- Consider adding a check for the `--allow-fs-read` flag in the code to prevent bypassing the permission model. 

Note: The code snippet provided does not contain the implementation of `fs.openAsBlob()`, but rather a part of it. The actual implementation of `fs.openAsBlob()` is not provided, so it's hard to give a definitive answer. However, based on the information given, the code snippet does not seem to be vulnerable
