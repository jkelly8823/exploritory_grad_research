 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not utilize the `fs.openAsBlob()` function, which is the specific vulnerability being addressed. The code snippet does contain an assertion that checks for an error when attempting to open a blocked file using `fs.openAsBlob()`, but this is a test case and not an actual usage of the function. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to this specific issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this issue, and no changes are necessary. However, if the code were to use `fs.openAsBlob()` in a production environment, it would be recommended to ensure that the `--allow-fs-read` flag is not used, or to implement additional checks to prevent bypassing the experimental permission model.  ```
