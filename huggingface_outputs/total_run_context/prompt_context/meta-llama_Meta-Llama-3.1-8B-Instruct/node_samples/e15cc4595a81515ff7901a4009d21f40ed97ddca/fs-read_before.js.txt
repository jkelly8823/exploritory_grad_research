 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30583 vulnerability because it uses the `fs.openAsBlob()` method without checking if the `--allow-fs-read` flag is enabled. This allows an attacker to bypass the experimental permission model and potentially access restricted files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the `--allow-fs-read` flag is enabled before using `fs.openAsBlob()`. This can be done by checking the `process.argv` array to see if the flag is present. If it is not, you should throw an error or handle the situation accordingly. Here is an example of how you can modify the code to include this check:
```javascript
if (process.argv.includes('--allow-fs-read')) {
  resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
} else {
  // Handle the situation where the flag is not enabled
  throw new Error('The --allow-fs-read flag is not enabled');
}
