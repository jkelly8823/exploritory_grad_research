None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code to ensure it is secure and follows best practices for handling sensitive data. Additionally, consider implementing input validation and error handling to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-11080
CVE Description:
In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback
