VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code snippet appears to be a part of an enumeration definition, which does not seem to be related to the HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload or the nghttp2 library.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code that needs to be fixed. However, if the code is intended to handle HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames, it should be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles large frame payloads and implements the recommended workaround for this vulnerability.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is using a version of nghttp2 that is not vulnerable to this issue.  Consider implementing the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback to handle large SETTINGS frames.  Consider using a version of nghttp2 that is greater than 1.41.0.  Consider implementing a limit on the number of settings entries that can be processed.  Consider implementing a limit on the size of the SETTINGS frame payload.  Consider implementing a mechanism to drop the connection if a large SETTINGS frame is received.  Consider implementing a mechanism to handle the denial of service attack
