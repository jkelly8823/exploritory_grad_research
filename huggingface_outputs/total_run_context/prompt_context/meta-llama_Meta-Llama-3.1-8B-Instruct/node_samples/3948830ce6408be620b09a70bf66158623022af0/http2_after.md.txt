 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided has the `maxSettings` option set to 32, which is the default value. This option is used to set the maximum number of settings entries per `SETTINGS` frame. The minimum value allowed is 1, and the default value is 32. This means that the code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability, as it does not allow for an overly large `SETTINGS` frame payload.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as the code is not vulnerable to this issue. However, it is recommended to keep the `maxSettings` option set to a reasonable value, such as the default value of 32, to prevent potential issues. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
