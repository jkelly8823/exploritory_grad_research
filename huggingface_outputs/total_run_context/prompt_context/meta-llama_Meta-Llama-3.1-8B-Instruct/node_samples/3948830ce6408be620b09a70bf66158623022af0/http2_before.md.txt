 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. This is because the code does not implement the `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback to drop the connection when a large SETTINGS frame is received. The code also does not set the `maxSessionMemory` option to limit the memory usage of the `Http2Session`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement the `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback to drop the connection when a large SETTINGS frame is received. Set the `maxSessionMemory` option to limit the memory usage of the `Http2Session`. For example, you can set `maxSessionMemory` to 1 to limit the memory usage to 1 megabyte. Additionally, consider setting `maxDeflateDynamicTableSize` to a reasonable value to prevent deflation attacks.
