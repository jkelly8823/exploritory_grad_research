 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability because it does not check the size of the SETTINGS frame payload. The nghttp2_option_set_max_settings function is called with the value from the buffer without any validation. This can lead to a denial of service attack if a malicious client sends a large SETTINGS frame payload.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback to check the number of settings entries in the received SETTINGS frame. If the number of settings entries is large, drop the connection. Alternatively, update the nghttp2 library to version 1.41.0 or later to fix the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-11080
CVE Description:
In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41
