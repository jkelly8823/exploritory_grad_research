 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34, 35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to TLS session reuse due to the lack of proper session management. In the `onnewsession` function, the `this.ssl._secureContext.context = null;` line is setting the secure context to null, which can lead to host certificate verification bypass. Additionally, the `this[kPendingSession] = null;` line is not properly cleaning up the pending session, allowing for potential session reuse.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly clean up the pending session by setting `this[kPendingSession] = null;` in the `onnewsession` function after verifying the session.
2. Implement proper session management by storing the session ID and verifying it before reusing the session.
3. Consider using a secure context object that is not easily manipulable by an attacker.
