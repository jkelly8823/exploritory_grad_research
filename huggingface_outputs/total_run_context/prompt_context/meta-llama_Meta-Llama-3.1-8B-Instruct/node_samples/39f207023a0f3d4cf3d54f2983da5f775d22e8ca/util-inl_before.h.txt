 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-36138 because it does not properly handle batch files with all possible extensions on Windows. The function `StringEqualNoCase` is used to check if the file extension is ".bat" or ".cmd", but it does not account for other possible extensions that may be used by a malicious actor. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands and achieve code execution even if the shell option is not enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle all possible batch file extensions on Windows, such as ".bat", ".cmd", ".exe", etc.
2. Consider using a more robust method to check file extensions, such as using a whitelist of allowed extensions.
3. Ensure that the `StringEqualNoCase` function is properly implemented to handle all possible cases. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to execute commands, such as using a sandboxed environment or a secure command execution library.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
