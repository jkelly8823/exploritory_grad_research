 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-36138 because it does not properly handle batch files with all possible extensions on Windows. The `suffixes` variable contains a list of possible batch file extensions, but it does not include all possible extensions. This allows a malicious command line argument to inject arbitrary commands and achieve code execution even if the shell option is not enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `suffixes` variable to include all possible batch file extensions on Windows.
2. Use a more robust method to handle batch files, such as using a library that properly handles file extensions and command line arguments.
3. Consider using a safer method to execute commands, such as using a library that provides a secure way to execute commands without the risk of code execution.
