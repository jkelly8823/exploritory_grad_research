 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121) because it does not have a timeout for handling large HTTP headers. This can cause the HTTP server to abort from heap allocation failure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Set a reasonable timeout for handling large HTTP headers using the `server.headersTimeout` option.
* Consider using a load balancer or other proxy layer to mitigate the attack potential. 

VULNERABLE: NO
