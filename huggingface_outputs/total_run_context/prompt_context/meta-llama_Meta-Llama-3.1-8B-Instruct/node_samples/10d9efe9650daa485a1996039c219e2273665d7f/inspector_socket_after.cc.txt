 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the DNS rebinding attacks described in CVE-2021-22884. The function `IsAllowedHost` checks if a host is allowed by verifying if it's empty, an IP address, or if it matches the string "localhost" (case-insensitive). However, it does not include "localhost6" in its whitelist, which is the specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE. The `TrimPort` function is not shown in the code snippet, but it's assumed to remove the port number from the host string, which is a common practice to prevent port-based attacks. The `IsIPAddress` function is also not shown, but it's assumed to check if a string is a valid IP address. The `node::StringEqualNoCase` function is used to compare strings in a case-insensitive manner.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be secure against the described vulnerability. However, it's essential to review the implementation of `TrimPort` and `IsIPAddress` functions to ensure they are correctly implemented and do not introduce any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider adding more hosts to
