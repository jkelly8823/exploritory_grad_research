 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as it includes "localhost6" in the whitelist. This allows an attacker to bypass the DNS rebinding protection by using the "localhost6" domain if they control the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove "localhost6" from the whitelist to prevent DNS rebinding attacks.
2. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent DNS rebinding attacks, such as validating the DNS responses or using a secure DNS resolution mechanism. 
3. Update the code to use a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of IP addresses or a secure domain name resolution mechanism. 
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against DNS rebinding attacks.  ```python
def is_allowed_host(host_with_port):
    host = host_with_port.split(":")[0]
    return host in ["localhost", "localhost6"] or is_ip_address(host)

def is_ip_address(host):
    try:
        socket.inet_aton(host)
        return True
    except socket.error:
        return False
``` 
This code is vulnerable to the same issue as the original
