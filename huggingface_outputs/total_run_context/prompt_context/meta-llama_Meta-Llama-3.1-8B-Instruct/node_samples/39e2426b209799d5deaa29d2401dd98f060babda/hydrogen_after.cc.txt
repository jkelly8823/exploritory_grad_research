 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any of the vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs. The code checks for potential overflows when calculating the offset value and limits it to 30 bits. Additionally, it handles the case where the index has no uses by deleting and replacing it with NULL. This suggests that the code is designed to prevent the out-of-bounds write and read vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security.
