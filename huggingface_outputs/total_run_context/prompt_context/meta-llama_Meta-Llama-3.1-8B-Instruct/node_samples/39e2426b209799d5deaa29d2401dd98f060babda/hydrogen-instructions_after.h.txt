 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code does not contain any obvious out-of-bounds writes or reads, and the use of bit fields and shift operations suggests that the code is designed to handle large index offsets. The MaxIndexOffsetBits() function returns a value that is consistent with the use of 32-bit integers, which further suggests that the code is not vulnerable to out-of-bounds writes or reads.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and secure. Additionally, consider using a code review tool to help identify potential security issues.
