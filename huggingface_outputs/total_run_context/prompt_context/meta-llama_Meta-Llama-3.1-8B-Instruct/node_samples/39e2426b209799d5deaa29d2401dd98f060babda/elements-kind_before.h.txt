 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the DehoistArrayIndex function or out-of-bounds reads/writes. The code appears to be a simple constant definition and function declarations, which do not seem to be related to the CVEs provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, and no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested before deployment.  ```python
def get_initial_fast_elements_kind():
    return ElementsKind.FIRST_FAST_ELEMENTS_KIND

def print_elements_kind(out, kind):
    # implementation of print_elements_kind function
    pass

def main():
    k_fast_elements_kind_count = LAST_FAST_ELEMENTS_KIND - FIRST_FAST_ELEMENTS_KIND + 1
    print_elements_kind(out, get_initial_fast_elements_kind())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
