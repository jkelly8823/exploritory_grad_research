 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) due to the use of the at() function on the graph_->blocks() vector. This function does not perform bounds checking and can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the block_id is not within the valid range of the vector. Additionally, the code is also vulnerable to a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) due to the use of the at() function on the graph_->blocks() vector in the ElementsKindToShiftSize function. This function can lead to an out-of-bounds write if the elements_kind is not within the valid range of the switch statement.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the at() function with caution and ensure that the index is within the valid range of the vector.
2. Use bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds reads and writes.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to the at() function, such as the operator[] or the find() function.
4. Add a check to ensure that the elements_kind is within the valid range of the switch statement in the ElementsKindToShiftSize function.
