 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any of the vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs. The code checks for potential overflows when calculating the offset value and returns early if the value is outside the valid range. Additionally, the code handles the case where the index has no uses by deleting and replacing it with NULL, which is a safe operation. The code does not contain any array indexing operations that could lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets the required security standards.  ```python
def analyze_code(code):
    # Define the vulnerabilities to check for
    vulnerabilities = {
        'CVE-2013-6639': lambda x: 'out-of-bounds write' in x,
        'CVE-2013-6640': lambda x: 'out-of-bounds read' in x
    }

    # Check for each vulnerability
    for cve, check in vulnerabilities.items():
        if check(code):
            return {
                '
