 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the OpenSSL library or any other library that would be vulnerable to the described CVE. The function `stream.isErrored(stream)` seems to be a part of the Node.js API and is used to check if a stream is in an error state. This function does not seem to be related to the OpenSSL library or any other library that would be vulnerable to the described CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to use a secure version of Node.js. Additionally, you should always validate and sanitize any user input to prevent potential security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4044
CVE Description:
Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO
