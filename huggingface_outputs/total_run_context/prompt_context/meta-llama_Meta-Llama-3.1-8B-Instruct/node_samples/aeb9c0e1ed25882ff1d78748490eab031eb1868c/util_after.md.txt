 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-4044 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a version of OpenSSL that is affected by this vulnerability, specifically OpenSSL 3.0.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to induce incorrect, application-dependent behavior by exploiting a combination of two issues in OpenSSL. The first issue is that X509_verify_cert() may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error, which is mishandled by OpenSSL. The second issue is that OpenSSL 3.0.0 will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain that does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of OpenSSL that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as OpenSSL 3.0.1 or later.
2. Implement the SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() function to handle the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value correctly.
3. Ensure that the certificate chain includes the Subject Alternative Name extension and that the Certificate Authority has not enforced name constraints.
