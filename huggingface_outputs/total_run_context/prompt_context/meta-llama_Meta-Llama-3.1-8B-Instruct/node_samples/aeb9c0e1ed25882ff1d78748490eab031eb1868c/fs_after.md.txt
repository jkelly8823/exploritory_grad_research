 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of the vulnerable function X509_verify_cert() or any related OpenSSL functions. However, the presence of the YAML comments suggests that the code is using Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment that may be vulnerable to the described issue if it is using an affected version of OpenSSL. The issue is related to the interaction between the Node.js code and the OpenSSL library, rather than the code itself. Therefore, the code is vulnerable due to its potential interaction with the affected OpenSSL library.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by the vulnerability, such as version 3.0.1 or later.
2. If using a custom OpenSSL library, ensure it is up-to-date and patched against the vulnerability.
3. Consider using a different library or implementation that is not affected by the vulnerability. 
4. Review the code for any potential interactions with the OpenSSL library and ensure they are properly handled.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
