 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not appear to be related to the OpenSSL library or any other library that would be vulnerable to the described issue. The function `stream.isErrored(stream)` seems to be a custom function that checks if a stream is in an error state, which does not seem to be related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-4044.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it would be a good practice to ensure that the function `stream.isErrored(stream)` is properly implemented and handles errors correctly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4044
CVE Description:
Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR
