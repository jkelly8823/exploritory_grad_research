 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the OpenSSL library or any other library that would be vulnerable to the described issue. The code is also not a segment of code that would be susceptible to the described vulnerability. It appears to be a documentation comment for a function in a Node.js application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to ensure that any external libraries or dependencies used in the application are up-to-date and patched against any known vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices and regularly review code for potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4044
CVE Description:
Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error()
