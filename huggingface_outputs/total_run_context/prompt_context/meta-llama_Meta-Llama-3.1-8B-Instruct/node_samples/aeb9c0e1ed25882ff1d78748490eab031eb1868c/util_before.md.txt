 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-4044 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a version of OpenSSL that is affected by this vulnerability, specifically OpenSSL 3.0.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to induce incorrect, application-dependent behavior by exploiting a combination of two issues in OpenSSL. The first issue is that X509_verify_cert() may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error, which is mishandled by OpenSSL. The second issue is that X509_verify_cert() may indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain that does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, update the version of OpenSSL to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as OpenSSL 3.0.1 or later. Additionally, consider implementing a cert verify callback to handle the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error(). This will help to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.
