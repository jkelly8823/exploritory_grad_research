 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-4044 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a version of OpenSSL that is affected by this vulnerability, specifically OpenSSL 3.0.0. The code is also using a feature that is known to be vulnerable to this issue, specifically the `path` parameter being a WHATWG `URL` object using the `file:` protocol.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the version of OpenSSL to a fixed version, such as OpenSSL 3.0.1 or later.
2. Avoid using the `path` parameter as a WHATWG `URL` object using the `file:` protocol, or ensure that the `file:` protocol is not used in conjunction with the `path` parameter. 
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern TLS library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4044
CVE Description: Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (
