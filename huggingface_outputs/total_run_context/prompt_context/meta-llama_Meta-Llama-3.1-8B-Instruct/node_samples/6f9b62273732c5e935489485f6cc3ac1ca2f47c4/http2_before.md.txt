 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the lack of a file descriptor limit. This is because the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option is not set, allowing an attacker to establish too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol', leading to a leak of file descriptors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option to a reasonable value, such as 10000, to prevent excessive connection attempts.
- Consider implementing a file descriptor limit to prevent the server from running out of file descriptors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22883
CVE Description:
Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to
