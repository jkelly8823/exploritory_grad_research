 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any Node.js code, but rather a YAML file describing changes to the Node.js project. The vulnerabilities listed (CVE-2021-22883, CVE-2021-22884, and CVE-2021-23840) are related to Node.js, but the code sample does not appear to be Node.js code. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not Node.js code and does not contain any vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22883
CVE Description:
Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive
