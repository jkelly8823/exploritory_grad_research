 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to the use of `Uint8Array` objects to specify paths. Although Node.js prevents path traversal through strings and `Buffer` objects, it does not prevent it through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects. This allows an attacker to traverse the file system by manipulating the path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using `Uint8Array` objects to specify paths. Instead, use strings or `Buffer` objects.
2. Use a library or module that provides path validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.
3. Consider upgrading to a version of Node.js that includes the permission model as a stable feature. This will provide additional security benefits and prevent path traversal attacks.
