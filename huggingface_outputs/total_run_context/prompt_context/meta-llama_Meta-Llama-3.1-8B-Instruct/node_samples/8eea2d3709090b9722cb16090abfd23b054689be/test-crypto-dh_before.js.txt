VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that calls EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() which are the functions impacted by the CVE-2023-5363 vulnerability. The code sample appears to be testing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-5363 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange functionality.  It is also recommended to ensure that the code is using the correct version of OpenSSL and that the FIPS provider is not being used if the application requires FIPS compliance.  Additionally, it is recommended to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as expected.  Finally, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL version up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  It is also recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters.  It is also recommended to use a secure method to generate the secret key.
