 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22883 vulnerability. This is because the code includes the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option with a default value of 10000, which can lead to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This is a known vulnerability in Node.js versions 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as version 14.4.0 or later.
- Set the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option to a lower value to prevent excessive connection attempts.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent denial of service attacks.
