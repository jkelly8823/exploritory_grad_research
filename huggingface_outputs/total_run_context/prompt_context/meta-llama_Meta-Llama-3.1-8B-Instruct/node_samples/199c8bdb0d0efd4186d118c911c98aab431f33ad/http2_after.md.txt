 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the presence of the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option with a default value of 10000. This option is related to CVE-2021-22883, which describes a vulnerability in Node.js where too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' can lead to a leak of file descriptors. The code is also vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks due to the presence of the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option, which is related to CVE-2021-22884. This is because the whitelist includes “localhost6”, which can be used to bypass the DNS rebinding protection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option from the code.
- Update the Node.js version to a version that is not vulnerable to these issues, such as v14.4.0 or later.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent DNS rebinding attacks, such as validating the domain name before making DNS requests.
