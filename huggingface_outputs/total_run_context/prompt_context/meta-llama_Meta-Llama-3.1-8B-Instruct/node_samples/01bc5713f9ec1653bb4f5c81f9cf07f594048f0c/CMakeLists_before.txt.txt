 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the nghttp2 library or its versions. However, it does use CMake, which is a build system generator that can be used to build nghttp2. The code snippet appears to be a CMakeLists.txt file, which is used to configure the build process for a project. It includes a check for the presence of the CUnit library and uses it to build a static library for unit tests. The installation of the nghttp2 library is also handled by this code. Since the code does not directly reference the nghttp2 library or its versions, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1000168 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the nghttp2 library or its versions. However, it is recommended to ensure that the nghttp2 library is properly updated to a version that is not vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1000168 vulnerability. This can be done by checking the version of the nghttp2 library and updating it to a version that is greater than or equal to 1.31.1.
