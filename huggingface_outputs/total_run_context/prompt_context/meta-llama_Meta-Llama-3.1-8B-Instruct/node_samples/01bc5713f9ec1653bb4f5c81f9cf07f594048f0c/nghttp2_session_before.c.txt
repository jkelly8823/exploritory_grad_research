 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1000168 vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to the improper input validation in the ALTSVC frame handling. The code does not properly validate the input data, which can lead to a segmentation fault and denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the nghttp2 library to version >= 1.31.1 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper input validation for the ALTSVC frame handling to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
3. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that all input data is properly validated before processing it. 
4. Regularly update the library and dependencies to ensure that the code is not vulnerable to known security issues. 
5. Use a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 
6. Implement a code review process to ensure that all code changes are reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. 
7. Use a secure coding standard to ensure that all code follows secure coding practices. 
8. Regularly test the code for security vulnerabilities using a penetration testing tool. 
9. Implement a bug bounty program to encourage security researchers to identify and
