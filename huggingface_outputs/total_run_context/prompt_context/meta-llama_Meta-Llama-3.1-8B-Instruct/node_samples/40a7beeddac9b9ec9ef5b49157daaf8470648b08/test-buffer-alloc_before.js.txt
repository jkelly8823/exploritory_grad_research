 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-7166 vulnerability because it uses the `Buffer.alloc()` method without checking the type of the `encoding` argument. This can lead to the method returning uninitialized memory if the `encoding` argument is a number.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should check the type of the `encoding` argument before passing it to `Buffer.alloc()`. You can use the `typeof` operator to check if the argument is a string or a number. If it's a number, you should throw an error or return an initialized buffer. Here is an example of how you can fix the code:
```javascript
if (typeof encoding!=='string') {
  throw new Error('Invalid encoding type');
}
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(size, encoding);
