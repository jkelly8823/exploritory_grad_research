 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a vulnerability related to the use of `process.binding()`, which is a deprecated API that can bypass the policy mechanism and potentially lead to privilege escalation. This is in line with the description of CVE-2023-32559.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using `process.binding()` as it is deprecated and can lead to security vulnerabilities.
2. Use the recommended alternatives for accessing internal Node.js modules.
3. Consider enabling the policy mechanism to restrict access to internal modules and prevent privilege escalation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-32559
CVE Description:
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x. The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental feature of Node.js.  ````
