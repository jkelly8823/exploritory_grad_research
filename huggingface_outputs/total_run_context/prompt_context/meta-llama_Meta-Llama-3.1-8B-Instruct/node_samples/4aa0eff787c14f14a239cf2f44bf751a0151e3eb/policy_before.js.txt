 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32559 due to the use of the deprecated API `process.binding()`. This API is used in the line `manifest = new Manifest(json, url);` where it bypasses the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules. This allows an attacker to take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` and run arbitrary code outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace the deprecated API `process.binding()` with the recommended `internalBinding()` API.
- Ensure that the policy mechanism is properly configured and up-to-date to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
- Consider upgrading to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-32559
CVE Description:
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x. The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside
