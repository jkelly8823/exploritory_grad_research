 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-32559 due to the use of the deprecated API `process.binding()`. This API is deprecated and can be bypassed by requiring internal modules, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file. The code attempts to make this API unavailable by throwing an `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` error when called, but this is not a reliable solution as it can be easily bypassed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the use of `process.binding()` and instead use the recommended alternative API.
2. Update the code to properly handle the policy mechanism and prevent bypassing.
3. Consider using a more robust policy mechanism, such as a dedicated policy library, to prevent privilege escalation vulnerabilities. 4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security guidelines. 5. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 6. Implement a code review process to ensure that all code changes are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities. 7. Consider using a security-focused testing framework to identify potential security
