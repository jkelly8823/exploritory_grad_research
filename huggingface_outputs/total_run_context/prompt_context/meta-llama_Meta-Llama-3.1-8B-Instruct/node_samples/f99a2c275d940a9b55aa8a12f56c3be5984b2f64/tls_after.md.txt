 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44531 vulnerability. This is because it includes a patch for the `uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative name type, which was previously accepted by Node.js versions prior to 12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, and 17.3.1. This patch is intended to prevent bypassing name-constrained intermediates by disabling the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use a version of Node.js that includes the patch for CVE-2021-44531, such as version 12.22.9 or later. Alternatively, the code can be modified to manually disable the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname. This can be done by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` option to `false` when creating an HTTPS server or client. However, this approach is not recommended as it may introduce additional security risks. It is recommended to update the code to use a patched version of Node.js.
