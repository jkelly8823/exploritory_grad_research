 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44531 vulnerability. This is because it includes a patch for the `uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative name type, which was previously accepted by Node.js versions prior to 12.22.9 and 14.18.3. This patch suggests that the previous versions of Node.js were vulnerable to accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, which could result in bypassing name-constrained intermediates.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable, such as 12.22.9 or 14.18.3. Alternatively, the `--security-revert` command-line option can be used to revert the fix for this vulnerability. However, this is not recommended as it may introduce other security risks. It is also recommended to review the code and ensure that it is not using any other vulnerable features or functions.
