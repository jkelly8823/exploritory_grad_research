 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a YAML comment block, which does not contain any executable code. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with sensitive data or critical systems.  ```bash
```bash
