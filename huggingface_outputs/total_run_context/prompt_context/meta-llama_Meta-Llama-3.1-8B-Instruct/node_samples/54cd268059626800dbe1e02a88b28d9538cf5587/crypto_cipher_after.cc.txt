 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack due to the use of RSA_PKCS1_PADDING for private key decryption. This is because the code does not properly handle the rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection option, which is required to prevent the Marvin Attack. The code checks if the option is supported, but if it is not supported, it does not throw an error, which allows the attack to succeed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle the rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection option by throwing an error if it is not supported.
2. Remove the use of RSA_PKCS1_PADDING for private key decryption and use a more secure padding scheme, such as RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING.
3. Consider updating the code to use a more secure version of OpenSSL that is not vulnerable to the Marvin Attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-46809
CVE Description:
Node.js versions which bundle an unpatched version of OpenSSL or run against a dynamically linked version of OpenSSL which are unpatched are vulnerable to the Marvin Attack - https://people.redhat.com
