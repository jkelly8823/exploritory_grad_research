 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a part of the Node.js HTTP/2 implementation. Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any direct references to the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list (CVE-2017-15896, CVE-2017-15897, CVE-2017-3738). The code seems to be focused on implementing HTTP/2 features, such as ping functionality, and does not appear to be related to the OpenSSL vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVEs. Therefore, I conclude that the code is not vulnerable to these specific issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the listed CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep Node.js and its dependencies up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to further harden your application.  Please note that this code is part of the Node.js core and is subject to change. It is recommended to review the official Node.js documentation and release notes for any updates or changes that may affect this code.  Also, consider using a static analysis tool
