VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-21890 vulnerability. This is because the wildcard character `*` is used in the file path `/home/test*`, which can lead to unintended access to files outside of the intended directory. The Node.js Permission Model's documentation does not clearly state that wildcards should only be used as the last character of a file path, making this a valid vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using wildcards in file paths when using the Node.js Permission Model.
2. Use the `--allow-fs-read` option with caution and only allow access to specific files or directories.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed files or directories, to prevent unintended access. 4. Update to a version of Node.js that has fixed this vulnerability. 5. Review the Node.js Permission Model documentation to ensure you understand the constraints and limitations of using wildcards in file paths. 6. Consider using a different permission model or approach that does not rely on wildcards. 7. If using a wildcard, ensure it is only used as the last character of the
