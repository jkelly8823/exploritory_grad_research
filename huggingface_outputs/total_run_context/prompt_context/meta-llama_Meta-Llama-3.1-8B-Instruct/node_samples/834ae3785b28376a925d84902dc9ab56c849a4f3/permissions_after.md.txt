 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains a vulnerability due to the use of a wildcard character (`*`) in the file path. This allows read access to everything that matches the wildcard, which can lead to unintended access to sensitive files. The Node.js Permission Model's documentation does not clearly indicate that wildcards should only be used as the last character of a file path, making this a potential security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using wildcard characters in file paths when using the Node.js Permission Model.
2. Use specific file paths instead of wildcards to ensure accurate and secure access control.
3. Review the Node.js Permission Model documentation to understand the correct usage of wildcards and other permission model constraints.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-21890
CVE Description:
The Node.js Permission Model does not clarify in the documentation that wildcards should be only used as the last character of a file path. For example:
```
 --allow-fs-read=/home/node/.ssh/*.pub
```

will ignore `pub` and give access to everything after `.ssh/`.

This misleading documentation affects all users using the experimental permission
