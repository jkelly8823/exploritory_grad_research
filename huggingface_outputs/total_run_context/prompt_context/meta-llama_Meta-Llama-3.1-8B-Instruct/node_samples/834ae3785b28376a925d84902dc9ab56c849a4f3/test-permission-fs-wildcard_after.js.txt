 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-21890 because it uses wildcards in the file path for the `--allow-fs-read` option. Specifically, the lines `--allow-fs-read=/a/b/*` and `--allow-fs-read=/etc/passwd.*` use wildcards that can be exploited to gain access to unintended files.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the wildcard character from the file path for the `--allow-fs-read` option. For example, change `--allow-fs-read=/a/b/*` to `--allow-fs-read=/a/b/c`.
2. Use a more specific file path for the `--allow-fs-read` option to avoid using wildcards. For example, change `--allow-fs-read=/etc/passwd.*` to `--allow-fs-read=/etc/passwd`. 
3. Consider using a more secure permission model that does not rely on wildcards. 
4. Update the code to handle the case where the `--allow-fs-read` option is not provided, to prevent unexpected behavior.  ```javascript
