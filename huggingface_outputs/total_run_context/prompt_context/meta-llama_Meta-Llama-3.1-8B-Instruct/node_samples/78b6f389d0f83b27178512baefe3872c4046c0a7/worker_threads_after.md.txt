 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a YAML file, which is not a programming language. However, the vulnerability list includes CVE-2020-7774, which is related to the package y18n. The y18n package is a JavaScript library, and the code sample does not contain any JavaScript code. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the y18n package is being used in the code. However, the presence of the YAML file suggests that the code may be using the y18n package, which is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Check if the y18n package is being used in the code.
- If the y18n package is being used, update it to version 3.2.2, 4.0.1, or 5.0.5 to fix the vulnerability.
- Consider using a different package that is not vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
