 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a YAML file, which is not a programming language that can be directly executed. However, the vulnerability listed is related to a package called y18n, which is a JavaScript library. The code sample does not contain any direct references to the y18n package or any code that could be vulnerable to the Prototype Pollution issue described in CVE-2020-7774. However, if the code is using the y18n package, it may be vulnerable to this issue. Therefore, the vulnerability is present in the context of the code, but not directly in the provided code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Check if the y18n package is being used in the codebase.
- If the y18n package is being used, update it to a version that is not vulnerable to the Prototype Pollution issue (e.g., version 3.2.2 or later, or version 4.0.1 or later, or version 5.0.5 or later).
- Consider using a more secure alternative to the y18n package.
