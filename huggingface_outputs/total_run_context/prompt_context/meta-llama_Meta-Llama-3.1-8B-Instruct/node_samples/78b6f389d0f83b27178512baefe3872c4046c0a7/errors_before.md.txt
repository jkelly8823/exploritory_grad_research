 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is related to an error in the HTTP/2 protocol, specifically the `ERR_HTTP2_TOO_MANY_INVALID_FRAMES` error. This error occurs when the peer sends too many invalid HTTP/2 protocol frames, exceeding the limit specified by the `maxSessionInvalidFrames` option. This is not directly related to the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE descriptions provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. This error is not related to the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE descriptions. However, to prevent this error, it is recommended to monitor and limit the number of invalid HTTP/2 protocol frames sent by the peer. This can be achieved by implementing a mechanism to track and enforce the `maxSessionInvalidFrames` limit. Additionally, consider upgrading to the latest version of the OpenSSL library to address the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE descriptions.  The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVEs listed.  However, the code does not handle the error in a way that would prevent it from being logged and potentially causing issues.  To handle this error, you could add a try/catch block to catch the error and handle it accordingly.  For
