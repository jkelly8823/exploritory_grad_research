 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a YAML configuration file, and it does not contain any code that can be analyzed for vulnerabilities. However, the description of the vulnerability CVE-2020-7774 mentions the package y18n, which is a JavaScript library for internationalization. The vulnerability is related to Prototype Pollution, which is a type of vulnerability that can occur in JavaScript code. Since the code sample provided is a YAML configuration file and not JavaScript code, it is not vulnerable to this issue. However, if the code is using the y18n library, it may be vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- If the code is using the y18n library, consider upgrading to a version that is not vulnerable to Prototype Pollution (e.g., version 3.2.2 or later).
- If the code is not using the y18n library, there is no need to take any action.
- Consider using a linter or code analysis tool to scan the code for potential vulnerabilities.
