 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a Node.js implementation of the `net.SocketAddress` class. Upon reviewing the code, it appears that it does not directly implement any of the vulnerable functions or methods mentioned in the provided CVE descriptions. However, the code does utilize the `net` module, which is a built-in Node.js module that provides a way to create network sockets. The `net` module is not directly vulnerable to the issues described in the CVEs, but it is possible that a malicious input or a specific configuration could lead to a vulnerability in the code that uses this module. Therefore, the code is considered vulnerable due to its potential to be used in a vulnerable context.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
1. Review the code that uses the `net` module to ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized.
2. Consider using a more secure alternative to the `net` module, such as a library that provides additional security features.
3. Keep the Node.js version up to date, as newer versions may include security patches for the `net` module.
4. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious inputs from
