 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a YAML file, and it does not contain any code that can be analyzed for vulnerabilities. However, the description of the changes in the YAML file mentions a potential vulnerability in the 'BlockList' type. This could potentially be related to the CVE-2020-7774 vulnerability in the y18n package, which is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. However, without more information or code, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code that uses the 'BlockList' type to ensure it is not vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
- Consider upgrading the y18n package to a version that is not vulnerable to Prototype Pollution (e.g. version 3.2.2 or later).
- If the 'BlockList' type is not used, consider removing it from the code to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
