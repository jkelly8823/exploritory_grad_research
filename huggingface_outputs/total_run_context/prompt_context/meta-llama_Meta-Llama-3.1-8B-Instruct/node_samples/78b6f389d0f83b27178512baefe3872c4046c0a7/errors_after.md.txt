 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is related to an error in the HTTP/2 protocol, specifically the `ERR_HTTP2_TOO_MANY_INVALID_FRAMES` error. This error occurs when the peer sends too many invalid HTTP/2 protocol frames, exceeding the limit specified by the `maxSessionInvalidFrames` option. This is not directly related to the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE descriptions provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. This error is not related to the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE descriptions. However, to prevent this error, it is recommended to monitor and limit the number of invalid HTTP/2 protocol frames sent by the peer. This can be achieved by implementing a mechanism to track and enforce the `maxSessionInvalidFrames` limit. Additionally, consider upgrading to the latest version of the library or framework being used to ensure you have the latest security patches and features.  The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the CVEs listed. It appears to be a part of the Node.js error codes documentation. Therefore, no specific code changes are recommended. However, it is essential to ensure that the `maxSessionInvalidFrames` option is properly configured and monitored to prevent this
