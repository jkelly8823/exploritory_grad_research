 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-32558 because it uses the deprecated API `process.binding()` in lines 14-15. This bypasses the permission model through path traversal, which is a security risk. The use of `process.binding()` is deprecated and should be avoided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `process.binding()` with the recommended `internal/process/permission` module.
2. Remove the `process.emitWarning()` call, as it is not necessary and can be misleading.
3. Consider removing the experimental permission model altogether, as it is an experimental feature and may not be suitable for production use. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-32558
CVE Description:
The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the permission model through path traversal. 

This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20.x. 
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const { EOL } = require('os');

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
hash.update('Hello, World!');
const digest = hash.digest('hex');
