 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker can create multiple request streams and continually shuffle the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the `stream_buf_ab_` is created and the `stream_buf_` is written to. The `stream_buf_ab_` is created without checking if the previous stream is still active, and the `stream_buf_` is written to without checking if the previous write is still active. This can lead to a resource loop where the streams are continually created and written to, consuming excess CPU.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the previous stream is still active before creating a new `stream_buf_ab_`.
2. Add a check to ensure that the previous write is still active before writing to the `stream_buf_`.
3. Consider implementing a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent streams to prevent resource loops.
