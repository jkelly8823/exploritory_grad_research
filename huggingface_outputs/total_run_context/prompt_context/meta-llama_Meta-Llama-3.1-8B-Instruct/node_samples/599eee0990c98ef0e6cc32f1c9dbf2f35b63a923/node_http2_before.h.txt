 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to HTTP/2 or any other protocol that could be vulnerable to the described resource loop denial of service attack. The code seems to be implementing a queue for handling HTTP/2 pings, but it does not contain any logic that could be exploited to create a resource loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is properly tested and validated. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures to protect against potential attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9513
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU. 

Code Sample:
  if (http2_stream->local_priority_ == 0) {
    http2_stream->local_priority_ = 1;
  }
  if (http2_stream->
