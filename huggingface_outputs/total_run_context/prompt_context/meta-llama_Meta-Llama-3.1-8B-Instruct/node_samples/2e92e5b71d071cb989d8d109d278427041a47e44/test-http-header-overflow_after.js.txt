 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to the incorrect handling of Transfer-Encoding headers. The code does not correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers, which can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS). This is a known issue in the llhttp parser in Node.js versions <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (v14.20.1 or later, v16.17.1 or later, v18.9.1 or later).
- Use a custom parser that correctly handles Transfer-Encoding headers.
- Avoid using the http module in Node.js for critical applications until a patch is released.
