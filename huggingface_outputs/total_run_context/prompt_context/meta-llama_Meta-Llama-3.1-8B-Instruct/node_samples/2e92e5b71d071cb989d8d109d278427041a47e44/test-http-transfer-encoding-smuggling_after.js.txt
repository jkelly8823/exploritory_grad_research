 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to the incorrect handling of multi-line Transfer-Encoding headers. The issue arises from the fact that the server does not correctly parse and validate the Transfer-Encoding headers, allowing an attacker to smuggle requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Node.js version to a version that is not vulnerable (v14.20.1, v16.17.1, or v18.9.1).
2. Use a secure Transfer-Encoding header parser that correctly handles multi-line headers.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent HTTP Request Smuggling, such as validating and sanitizing user input.
