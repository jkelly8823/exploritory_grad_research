 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the incorrect handling of Transfer-Encoding headers. The issue arises from the fact that the code does not correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers, which can lead to HRS. Specifically, the code does not handle multi-line Transfer-Encoding headers correctly, as seen in the provided code sample where the 'Content-Length' header is split across multiple lines.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the llhttp parser to a version that is not vulnerable to HRS, such as v14.20.2 or later.
2. Implement proper handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, including multi-line headers, to prevent HRS.
3. Use a secure method to handle HTTP requests, such as using a library that is designed to prevent HRS.
