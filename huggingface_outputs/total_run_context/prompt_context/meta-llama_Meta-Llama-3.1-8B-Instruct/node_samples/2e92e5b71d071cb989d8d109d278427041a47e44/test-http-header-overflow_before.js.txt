 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to the incorrect handling of Transfer-Encoding headers. The code does not correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers, which can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS). This is a known issue in the llhttp parser in Node.js versions prior to v16.17.1 and v18.9.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as v16.17.1 or later.
2. Use a custom parser that correctly handles Transfer-Encoding headers.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as validating user input and checking for suspicious requests.
