 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the incorrect handling of Transfer-Encoding headers. The llhttp parser in the http module in Node.js does not correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers, which can lead to HRS. In this code sample, the Transfer-Encoding headers are not correctly handled, allowing an attacker to smuggle HTTP requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the llhttp parser to a version that is not vulnerable to HRS, such as v14.20.2 or later.
2. Use a custom parser that correctly handles Transfer-Encoding headers.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as validating user input and checking for suspicious request patterns.
