 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to the incorrect handling of Transfer-Encoding headers. Specifically, the code does not correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers, which can lead to HRS. This is evident in the third test case where a malicious client sends a request with a malformed Transfer-Encoding header, which is not properly handled by the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Node.js version to a patched version (v14.20.2, v16.17.2, or v18.9.2) to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional validation and parsing for Transfer-Encoding headers to prevent HRS.
3. Use a secure HTTP parser library that is not vulnerable to HRS. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32213
CVE Description:
The llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js does not correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers and can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS).
