 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22020 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the `--experimental-network-imports` flag, which allows for network imports. However, the code is not properly validating the imports, which makes it possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code by embedding non-network imports in data URLs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the imports. This can be done by checking the `url` object to ensure that it is not a data URL. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a secure way of importing modules, such as using the `import()` function with a secure URL. The `--experimental-network-imports` flag should also be removed, as it is not necessary for the code to function correctly.
