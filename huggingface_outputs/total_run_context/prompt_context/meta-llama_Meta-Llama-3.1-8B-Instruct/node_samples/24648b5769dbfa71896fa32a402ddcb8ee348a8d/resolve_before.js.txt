 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22020 vulnerability due to the presence of network imports in data URLs. The line `protocol === 'data:'` checks for data URLs, but the subsequent check for `experimentalNetworkImports` and the return statement can still allow network imports to bypass restrictions. This is a classic example of a bypass vulnerability, where an attacker can exploit the code to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the check for `protocol === 'data:'` and only allow network imports when `experimentalNetworkImports` is true.
2. Add a check to ensure that `experimentalNetworkImports` is false before allowing network imports.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed protocols or using a separate module to handle network imports. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22020
CVE Description:
A security flaw in Node.js  allows a bypass of network import restrictions.
By embedding non-network imports in data URLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, compromising system security.
Verified on various platforms, the vulnerability is mitigated by forbidding
