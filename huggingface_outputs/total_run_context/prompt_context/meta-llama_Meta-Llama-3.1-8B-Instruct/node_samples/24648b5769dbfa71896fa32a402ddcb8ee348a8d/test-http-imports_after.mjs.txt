EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22020 vulnerability due to the use of data URLs in network imports. The code attempts to import modules from data URLs, which can be used to bypass network import restrictions and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present in multiple lines of code, specifically in the import statements that use data URLs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to prevent the use of data URLs in network imports. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the imported module is not a data URL. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a secure method for importing modules, such as using a secure protocol like HTTPS. The specific lines of code that are vulnerable should be modified to use a secure import method, such as importing the module directly from a file or using a secure protocol.
