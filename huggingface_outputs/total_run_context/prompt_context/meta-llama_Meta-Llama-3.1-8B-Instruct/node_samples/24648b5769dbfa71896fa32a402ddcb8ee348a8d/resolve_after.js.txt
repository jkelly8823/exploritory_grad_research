 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22020 vulnerability because it allows network imports from data URLs. The condition `protocol === 'data:'` is checked, but it is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The code also checks if `experimentalNetworkImports` is true, but this flag is not a reliable way to prevent the vulnerability. The correct way to prevent the vulnerability is to forbid data URLs in network imports, as mentioned in the CVE description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the condition `protocol === 'data:'` and always throw an error when `experimentalNetworkImports` is true.
2. Set `experimentalNetworkImports` to false to prevent network imports from data URLs.
3. Use a more secure way to handle network imports, such as using a whitelist of allowed protocols. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22020
CVE Description:
A security flaw in Node.js  allows a bypass of network import restrictions.
By embedding non-network imports in data URLs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, compromising system security.
Verified on various platforms, the vulnerability is mitigated by forbidding
