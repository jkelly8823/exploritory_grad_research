 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be Node.js code, but rather a C++ code snippet that defines a series of error codes. The crypto.setEngine() API is not present in this code, and the OpenSSL engine is not being loaded or manipulated. Therefore, the CVE-2023-30586 vulnerability is not applicable to this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities specific to C++ or the Node.js permission model, if applicable.  ```bash

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
Apache Log4j 2.0-beta9 through 2.14.1 does not protect from uncontrolled recursion from JNDI lookups, which allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack by constructing a recursive lookup. The attack complexity is high.

Code Sample:
  const logger = log4j.getLogger();
  logger.setLevel(log4j.Level.ALL);
  logger.info("Hello, World!");
  const jndi = new JND
