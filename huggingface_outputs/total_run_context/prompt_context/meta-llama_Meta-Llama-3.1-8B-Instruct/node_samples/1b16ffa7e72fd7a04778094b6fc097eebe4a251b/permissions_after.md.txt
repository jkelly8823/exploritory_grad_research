 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any explicit code, but based on the given constraints and the description of the vulnerability, it appears that the vulnerability is related to the use of OpenSSL engines and the Permission Model in Node.js. The code sample does not directly load an arbitrary OpenSSL engine, but the vulnerability can be exploited when the experimental permission model is enabled. Therefore, the code is vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the experimental permission model by setting the `--experimental-permission-model` flag to `false` when running the Node.js process.
2. Avoid using the `crypto.setEngine()` API when the Permission Model is enabled.
3. Use a secure version of Node.js that does not have this vulnerability.
