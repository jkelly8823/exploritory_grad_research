 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly interacts with the OpenSSL engine or the permission model. The function `is_scope_granted(permission, res)` is not shown, but based on the context, it appears to be checking if a permission is granted for a given resource. The `enabled()` function simply returns the value of the `enabled_` member variable. The static functions `StringToPermission`, `PermissionToString`, and `ThrowAccessDenied` are not shown, but they do not appear to be related to the OpenSSL engine or the permission model. Therefore, this code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30586 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially be exploited by the CVE-2023-30586 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code that calls the `is_scope_granted(permission, res)` function to ensure that it is not vulnerable to this issue. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code that uses the `crypto.setEngine()` API to ensure that it is not being used in a way that could bypass the permission model.
