 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-30586 because it checks if the permission model is enabled before allowing the loading of an OpenSSL engine. However, the permission model is an experimental feature and can be bypassed by manipulating the process's stack memory. This allows an attacker to load arbitrary OpenSSL engines, potentially bypassing the permission model.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the experimental permission model to prevent this vulnerability.
2. Use a secure method to load OpenSSL engines, such as using a whitelist of allowed engines.
3. Consider upgrading to a version of Node.js that has fixed this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30586
CVE Description:
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The attack complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine() API can be used to bypass the permission model when called with a compatible OpenSSL engine. The OpenSSL engine can, for example, disable the permission model in the host process by manipulating the process's stack memory to locate the permission
