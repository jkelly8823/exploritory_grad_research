 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the OpenSSL engine or the permission model. The function is_scope_granted(permission, res) is called, but the implementation of this function is not provided. However, based on the description of the vulnerability, it appears that the vulnerability is related to the crypto.setEngine() API, which is not used in this code sample. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to this CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that could potentially be exploited by this vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the is_scope_granted(permission, res) function to ensure it does not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, if the permission model is enabled in the Node.js environment, it is recommended to disable it or ensure that it is properly configured to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30586
CVE Description:
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The attack complexity is high. However
