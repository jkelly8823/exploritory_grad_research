 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30586. The code does not call the crypto.setEngine() API, which is the primary method of bypassing the permission model. Additionally, the code does not manipulate the process's stack memory to locate the permission model Permission::enabled_ in the host process's heap memory, which is another method of bypassing the permission model. The code does appear to load an engine using the LoadEngineById() function, but this is a standard function used to load engines and does not appear to be related to the CVE-2023-30586.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30586. However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
