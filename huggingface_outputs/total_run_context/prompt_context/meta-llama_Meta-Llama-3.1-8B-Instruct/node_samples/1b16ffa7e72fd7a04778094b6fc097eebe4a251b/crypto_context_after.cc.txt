 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-30586 because it allows loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled. This can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The code checks if the permission model is enabled and returns an error if it is, but this check is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the process's stack memory to locate the permission model Permission::enabled_ in the host process's heap memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the experimental permission model.
2. Use a secure method to load OpenSSL engines, such as using a whitelist of allowed engines.
3. Implement additional security checks to prevent manipulation of the process's stack memory. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30586
CVE Description:
A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The attack complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine() API can be used to bypass the permission model when called with a compatible OpenSSL engine. The OpenSSL engine
