 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22883 vulnerability. This is because the code includes the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option with a default value of 10000, which is a known vulnerable version. The code does not include any patches or fixes for this vulnerability, making it susceptible to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the code to a version that includes the patch for CVE-2021-22883, such as version 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, or 15.10.0.
- Set the `unknownProtocolTimeout` option to a value that is not vulnerable, such as 0 or a very large number.
- Consider using a more secure version of Node.js that includes the patch for CVE-2021-22883.
