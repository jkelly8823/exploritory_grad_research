 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described issue. The code appears to be a header file defining version numbers and a flag for strict mode, which is not related to the HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in the llhttp parser.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described issue. However, if the code is intended to be used in a context where HTTP request smuggling is a concern, it may be worth considering using a more secure parser or implementing additional validation and sanitization of HTTP requests.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30589, CVE Description: The llhttp parser in the http module in Node v20.2.0 does not strictly use the CRLF sequence to delimit HTTP requests. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS). The CR character (without LF) is sufficient to delimit HTTP header fields in the llhttp parser. According to RFC7230 section 3, only the CRLF sequence should delimit each header-field. This impacts all Node.js active versions: v16, v18,
