 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE-2024-22018. The code snippet is a series of error messages, and there is no indication of the experimental permission model or the fs.lstat API being used. The error messages are simply defined using the E function, which does not involve file system operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability described in the CVE. However, it is essential to note that the experimental permission model is not being used in this code snippet, and the vulnerability is specific to this feature. If the code were to use the experimental permission model and the fs.lstat API, it would be vulnerable to this issue.  ```javascript
