 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22018 due to the experimental permission model not restricting file stats through the fs.lstat API when the --allow-fs-read flag is used. The code checks if the permission model is enabled and if the user has the 'fs.read' permission for the given path. However, it does not check if the user has the 'fs.lstat' permission, which is required to retrieve file stats. This allows malicious actors to retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability.
2. Disable the experimental permission model by removing the --allow-fs-read flag.
3. Implement additional permission checks to ensure that the user has the 'fs.lstat' permission before retrieving file stats. This can be done by adding a check for 'fs.lstat' permission in the permission model. 
4. Consider using a more secure permission model that does not rely on the experimental permission model. 
5. Review and update the code to use the secure permission model.  ```javascript
