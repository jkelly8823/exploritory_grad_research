 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22018 vulnerability due to the use of the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21. The code attempts to restrict file access using the `fs.cpSync` and `fs.open` functions, but it does not properly handle the `fs.lstat` function, which can be used to retrieve file stats without explicit read access. This allows malicious actors to bypass the permission model and access files they should not have access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability (Node.js 22 or later).
2. Disable the experimental permission model by removing the `--allow-fs-read` flag.
3. Use a secure alternative to `fs.lstat`, such as `fs.access` or `fs.stat`, which do not allow malicious actors to retrieve file stats without explicit read access. 
4. Implement additional security measures, such as file system access control lists (ACLs) or file system permissions, to restrict access to sensitive files. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure
