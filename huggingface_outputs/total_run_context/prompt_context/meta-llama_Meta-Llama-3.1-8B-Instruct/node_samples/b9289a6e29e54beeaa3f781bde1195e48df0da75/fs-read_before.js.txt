 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22018 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the experimental permission model in Node.js, which is affected by this vulnerability. The code is attempting to read files in a blocked folder, and the permission model is not restricting access to file stats through the fs.lstat API. This allows malicious actors to retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability (Node.js 19 or earlier).
2. Disable the experimental permission model by removing the --allow-fs-read flag.
3. Use a secure alternative to the experimental permission model, such as the built-in permission model.
4. Implement additional security measures to restrict access to file stats, such as using the fs.accessSync API to check for read access before attempting to read a file. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
