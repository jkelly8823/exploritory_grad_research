 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22018 vulnerability because it uses the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21. The `binding.lstat` function is called with the `options.bigint` flag, which is part of the experimental permission model. This allows malicious actors to retrieve stats from files that they do not have explicit read access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability (Node.js 22 or later).
2. Disable the experimental permission model by removing the `--allow-fs-read` flag.
3. Use a secure alternative to the `fs.lstat` API, such as `fs.statSync`. 
4. If the experimental permission model is required, ensure that the `fs.lstat` API is used with proper permission checks to prevent malicious actors from retrieving stats from unauthorized files. 5. Consider using a secure library or framework that handles file system operations securely. 6. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure. 7. Implement a secure coding practice that includes code reviews and testing to prevent similar vulnerabilities
