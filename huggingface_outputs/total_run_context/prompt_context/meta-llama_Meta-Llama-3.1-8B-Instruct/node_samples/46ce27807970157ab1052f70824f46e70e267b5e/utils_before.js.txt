 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to the use of Buffer.from() to obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). This allows an attacker to modify the result of path.resolve() by monkey-patching Buffer internals, specifically Buffer.prototype.utf8Write.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using Buffer.from() to obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). Instead, use Buffer.from() to create a new Buffer from a string or array.
2. Use a secure method to resolve paths, such as using the path.resolve() method with a secure path separator.
3. Implement input validation to prevent path traversal attacks. For example, you can use the path.normalize() method to normalize the path before resolving it. 
4. Consider using a library like 'path' to handle path manipulation securely. 
5. If using the experimental permission model, ensure that it is properly configured and secured. 
6. Regularly update Node.js to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches. 7. Consider using a secure coding practice like 'path.join' to join paths securely. 8. Avoid using monkey-patching to modify internal Buffer
