 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the use of the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21. The permission model's protection against path traversal attacks can be bypassed by monkey-patching Buffer internals, specifically Buffer.prototype.utf8Write. This allows an attacker to modify the result of path.resolve(), leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21.
2. Use a secure alternative to the permission model, such as the built-in fs module.
3. If using the permission model, ensure that Buffer.prototype.utf8Write is not monkey-patched.
4. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Node.js that does not have this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-21896
CVE Description:
The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by calling path.resolve() on any paths given by the user. If the path is to be treated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching Buffer internals,
