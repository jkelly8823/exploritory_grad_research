 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun due to the use of the '.' character in the email address. This can be exploited by an attacker to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes on the stack, potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method to handle email addresses in certificates, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters.
- Consider using a more secure library for certificate verification, such as OpenSSL.
- Ensure that the application continues to verify the certificate chain even if the name constraint check fails. This can be done by setting the `verify` option to `1` in the OpenSSL library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing
