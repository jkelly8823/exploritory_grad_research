 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `PEM_read_bio_Parameters` function, which can be triggered by a malicious certificate. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack, resulting in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Use a secure method to read parameters from a certificate, such as `EVP_PKEY_CTX_new` with a secure parameter.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure
