 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Remove all references to invalid OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA names for CRT parameters in OpenSSL code.
3. Use the numbered names such as OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_RSA_FACTOR1 instead of the invalid names.
4. Ensure that the key share group sent or accepted for the key exchange is allowed for the protocol version. 
5. Fix the handling of a ticket key callback that returns 0 in TLSv1.3 to not send a ticket. 
6. Correctly handle a retransmitted ClientHello in DTLS. 
7.
