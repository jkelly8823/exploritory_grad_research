 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described buffer overruns in X.509 certificate verification. The code is written in Perl and appears to be testing the functionality of the OpenSSL library, but it does not involve any certificate verification or parsing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that any external libraries or dependencies, such as OpenSSL, are up to date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities.
