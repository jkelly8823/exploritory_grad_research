 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the OpenSSL library or its functions. However, the presence of the OpenSSL copyright notice suggests that the code may be part of a larger project that utilizes OpenSSL. The vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 are related to X.509 certificate verification in OpenSSL, which is not directly present in this code snippet. Nevertheless, if this code is part of a project that uses OpenSSL, it may be vulnerable to these issues if the OpenSSL library is not properly updated or configured.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the project's dependencies and ensure that OpenSSL is up-to-date and properly configured.
2. If using OpenSSL, consider upgrading to a version that has fixed the vulnerabilities (e.g., OpenSSL 3.0.7).
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to mitigate potential attacks.
