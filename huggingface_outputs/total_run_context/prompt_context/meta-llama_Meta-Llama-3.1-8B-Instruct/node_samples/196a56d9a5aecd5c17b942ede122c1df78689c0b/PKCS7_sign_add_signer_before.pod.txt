 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically the PKCS7_sign_add_signer function. This function is used to add a signer to a PKCS7 signed data structure. The code does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVEs provided (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786). The CVEs describe buffer overflows in X.509 certificate verification, which is not relevant to this code sample. The code is well-structured and follows standard OpenSSL conventions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, developers should be aware of the potential risks associated with using the PKCS7_sign_add_signer function, such as the possibility of buffer overflows in the input data. Developers should take necessary precautions to validate and sanitize the input data to prevent any potential security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
