 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_CIPHERS` option, which can be exploited by an attacker to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using the `OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_CIPHERS` option.
- Use a secure version of OpenSSL that has been patched for this vulnerability.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as stack canaries or address space layout randomization (ASLR).  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email
