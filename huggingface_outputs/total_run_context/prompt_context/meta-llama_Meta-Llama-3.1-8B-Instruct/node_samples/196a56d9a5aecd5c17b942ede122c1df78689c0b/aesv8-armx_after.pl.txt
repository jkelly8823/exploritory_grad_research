VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be a snippet from the OpenSSL library, specifically from the AES encryption implementation. Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any evidence of the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code seems to be implementing various AES encryption and decryption operations using ARM64 assembly instructions. The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and the use of registers and immediate values suggests a controlled and safe memory access pattern. However, it is essential to note that the code's complexity and the use of assembly instructions make it challenging to thoroughly analyze without extensive knowledge of the OpenSSL library and the specific implementation details.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code in the context of the OpenSSL library and its specific implementation details to ensure that the absence of buffer overflow vulnerabilities is not due to a misunderstanding of the code's functionality.
2. Consider using a static analysis tool or
