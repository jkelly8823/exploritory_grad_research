 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. However, it does contain functions related to OpenSSL library contexts, which could potentially be used in a vulnerable manner if not properly configured or used. The presence of these functions does not necessarily indicate a vulnerability, but it does suggest that the code may be using OpenSSL in a way that could be vulnerable to the issues described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. Further analysis of the code and its usage would be required to determine the actual risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code's usage of OpenSSL library contexts to ensure that it is properly configured and used to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
2. Consider using a secure configuration for the OpenSSL library context, such as loading only trusted providers and configuring the library context to reject untrusted certificates.
3. Ensure that the code is using a version of OpenSSL that is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
