 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code is written in Perl and uses the OpenSSL library, but it does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. The code is focused on testing the dhparam CLI application and does not appear to be susceptible to the buffer overflows described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code sample uses the OpenSSL library, which may have its own set of vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. It is recommended to review the OpenSSL library documentation and follow best practices for secure coding.  The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described CVEs.
