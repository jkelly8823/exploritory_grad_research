 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun vulnerability due to the use of ECB mode in AES encryption. ECB mode is a block cipher mode that is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks and can be used to extract sensitive information from encrypted data. This is a high-risk vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use a secure block cipher mode such as CBC, GCM, or CTR instead of ECB.
* Ensure that the encryption key is properly generated and managed to prevent key reuse and other security issues.
* Regularly update and patch the OpenSSL library to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3711
