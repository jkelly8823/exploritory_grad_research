 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any buffer overruns. The code is using the OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN and OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_uint functions to add parameters to the OSSL_PARAM array, which are designed to handle large numbers and integers. The code also checks for errors and frees the OSSL_PARAM_BLD object when it is no longer needed. This suggests that the code is designed to handle large inputs and prevent buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is following best practices for error handling and memory management. Additionally, it may be beneficial to consider using a more modern and secure way of handling RSA keys, such as using a library that provides secure key management and handling.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2022-3602 or CVE-2022-3786 as it does not contain any code that would trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code is using the OSSL_PARAM_BLD functions to add parameters to the OSSL_PARAM
