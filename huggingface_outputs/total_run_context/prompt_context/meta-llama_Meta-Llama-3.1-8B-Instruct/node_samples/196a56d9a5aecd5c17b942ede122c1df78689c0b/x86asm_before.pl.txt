 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a buffer overrun vulnerability in the X.509 certificate verification process, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `&::data_byte` function, which can overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack. This can result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a safer function for data manipulation, such as `&::data_word` or `&::data_dword`.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Consider using a more secure method for certificate verification, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
