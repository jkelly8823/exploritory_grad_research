 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `EVP_CTRL_AEAD_GET_TAG` control function, which can potentially overflow the stack with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as stack canary protection or address space layout randomization (ASLR).
- Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL for cryptographic operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal
