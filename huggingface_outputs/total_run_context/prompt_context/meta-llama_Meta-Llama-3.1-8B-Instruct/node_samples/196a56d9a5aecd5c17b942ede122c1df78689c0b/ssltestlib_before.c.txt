VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
3. Ensure that the stack layout for any given platform/compiler is secure to prevent buffer overflows. 
4. Validate the input data to prevent buffer overflows. 
5. Use a secure method to handle certificate verification. 
6. Implement a secure way to handle the insertion of packets in the sk_MEMPACKET_value function. 
7. Use a secure method to handle the BIO_get_data function. 
8. Implement a secure way to handle the
