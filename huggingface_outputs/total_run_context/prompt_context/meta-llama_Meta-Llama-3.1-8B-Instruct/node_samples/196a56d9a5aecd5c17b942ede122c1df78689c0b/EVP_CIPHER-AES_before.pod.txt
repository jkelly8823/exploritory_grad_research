 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack due to the use of ECB mode encryption. ECB mode is a block cipher mode that is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks and can be used to extract sensitive information from encrypted data. This is a high-risk vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more secure encryption mode, such as CBC or GCM. Additionally, the use of ECB mode should be avoided altogether, as it is not considered secure for encrypting sensitive data. It is also recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate the initialization vector (IV) for the encryption algorithm. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3711
CVE Description:
A padding oracle attack can be triggered in the OpenSSL library when using the AES-128-ECB, AES-192-ECB, and AES-256-ECB encryption modes. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to extract sensitive information from encrypted data. The vulnerability is due to the way OpenSSL handles padding in the encryption process. The
