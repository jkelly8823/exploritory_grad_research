VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code is focused on tracing ciphers used by the TLS/SSL protocol and does not involve any name constraint checking or certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could
