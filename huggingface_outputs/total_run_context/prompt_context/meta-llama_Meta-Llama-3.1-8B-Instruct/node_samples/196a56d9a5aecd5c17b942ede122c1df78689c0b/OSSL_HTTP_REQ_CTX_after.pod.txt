 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (OSSL_HTTP_DEFAULT_MAX_LINE_LEN) to store the HTTP request header lines, which can be overflowed by a maliciously crafted email address in a certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to dynamically allocate memory for the HTTP request header lines, rather than using a fixed-size buffer. This can be achieved by using a variable-size buffer or a data structure that can handle variable-length strings. Additionally, the code should be updated to properly handle and validate the email address in the certificate to prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker
