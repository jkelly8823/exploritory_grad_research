 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a man page for OpenSSL, which is a cryptographic library. The vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 are related to X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. However, the code sample does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code sample, as it is not vulnerable to the specified vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service
