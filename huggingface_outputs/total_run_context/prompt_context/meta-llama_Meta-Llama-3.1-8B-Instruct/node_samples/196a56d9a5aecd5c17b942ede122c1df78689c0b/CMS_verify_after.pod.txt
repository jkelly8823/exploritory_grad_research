VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as stack canaries or address space layout randomization (ASLR).
3. Consider using a more secure certificate verification library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
4. Ensure that the trusted certificate store is properly configured and up-to-date to prevent attacks that rely on compromised certificates.
