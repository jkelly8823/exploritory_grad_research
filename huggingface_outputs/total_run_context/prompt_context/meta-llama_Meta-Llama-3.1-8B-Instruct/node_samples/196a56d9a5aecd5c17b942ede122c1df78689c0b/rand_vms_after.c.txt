 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-40
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the name constraint checking of X.509 certificate verification. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious email address in a certificate that overflows an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Ensure that the stack layout for any given platform/compiler is secure to prevent buffer overflows. 
4. Use a secure method to construct a path to a trusted issuer to prevent certificate chain signature verification failure. 
5. Implement a secure method to handle malicious email addresses
