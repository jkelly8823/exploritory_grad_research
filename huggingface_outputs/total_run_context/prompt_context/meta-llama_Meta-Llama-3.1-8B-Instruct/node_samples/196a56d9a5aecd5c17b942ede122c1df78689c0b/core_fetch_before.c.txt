 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate the risk.
4. Ensure that the application continues certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer only if necessary and with proper validation. 

VULNERABLE: NO

EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, as described in CVE-2022-3786. This is
