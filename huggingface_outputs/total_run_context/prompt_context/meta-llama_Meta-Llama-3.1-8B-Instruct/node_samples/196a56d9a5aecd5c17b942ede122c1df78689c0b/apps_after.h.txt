VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the X.509 certificate verification process, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL (version 3.0.7 or later) to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Ensure that the application continues certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer only when necessary and with proper validation.
4. Regularly update and patch the OpenSSL library to ensure that any newly discovered vulnerabilities are addressed.
