 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a list of OpenSSL commands and their corresponding man pages. However, the code does not contain any explicit code that can be analyzed for vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities due to the use of OpenSSL commands, which are affected by these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that is not affected by these vulnerabilities. Specifically, upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later. Additionally, ensure that the stack overflow protections are enabled on the platform to mitigate the risk of remote code execution. If possible, consider using a different library or implementation that is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
