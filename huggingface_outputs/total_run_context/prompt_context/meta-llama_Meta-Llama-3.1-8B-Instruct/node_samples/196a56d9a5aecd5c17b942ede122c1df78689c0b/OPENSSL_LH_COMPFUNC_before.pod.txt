 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation in the lh_TYPE_insert function, which can lead to a stack overflow when processing a malicious email address in a certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation in the lh_TYPE_insert function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure function to process X.509 certificates, such as OpenSSL's X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt function.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a linked list, to store the hash table entries.
