 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that could be vulnerable to the buffer overruns described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code is written in Perl and appears to be a test script for the OpenSSL library. The code does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the buffer overruns described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service)
