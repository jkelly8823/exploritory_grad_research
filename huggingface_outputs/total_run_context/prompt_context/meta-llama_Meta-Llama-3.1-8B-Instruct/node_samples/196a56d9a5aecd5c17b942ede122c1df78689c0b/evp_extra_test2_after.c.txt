 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. However, it's worth noting that the code is using OpenSSL, which has a history of vulnerabilities. It's essential to keep the OpenSSL version up-to-date and follow best practices for secure coding.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the OpenSSL version is up-to-date.
2. Use a secure coding practice, such as code reviews and testing, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern cryptography library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections
