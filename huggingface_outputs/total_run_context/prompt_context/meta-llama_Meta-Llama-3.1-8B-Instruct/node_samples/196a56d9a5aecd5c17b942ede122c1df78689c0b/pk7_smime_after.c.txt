 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent the application from continuing certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
3. Validate the input data to prevent buffer overflows.
