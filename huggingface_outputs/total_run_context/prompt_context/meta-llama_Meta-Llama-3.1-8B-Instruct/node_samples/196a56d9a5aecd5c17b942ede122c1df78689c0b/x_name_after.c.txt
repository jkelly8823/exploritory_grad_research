 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication. The buffer overrun could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution, although stack overflow protections may mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent certificate chain signature verification from being bypassed.
3. Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL for certificate verification.
