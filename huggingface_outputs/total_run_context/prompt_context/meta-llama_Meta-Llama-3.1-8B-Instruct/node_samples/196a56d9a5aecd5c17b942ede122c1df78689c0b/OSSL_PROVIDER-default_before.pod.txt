 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any explicit code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, the code does contain a reference to a function that may be vulnerable, specifically the EVP_MD-MD5-SHA1 function. This function is not explicitly called in the provided code, but it is referenced in the documentation. The EVP_MD-MD5-SHA1 function is a part of the OpenSSL library, which has been known to have vulnerabilities in the past. Therefore, it is possible that the code may be vulnerable to a vulnerability in this function, but it would require further analysis to determine the exact nature of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the documentation for the EVP_MD-MD5-SHA1 function to determine if it is still supported and if there are any known vulnerabilities associated with it.
2. If the EVP_MD-MD5-SHA1 function is still supported, consider using a different function or library to perform the desired operation.
3. If the EVP_MD-MD5-SHA1 function is not supported, consider updating the code to use a different function or library that is known to be secure.
4. Consider performing
