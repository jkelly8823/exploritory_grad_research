 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library and is focused on performing a Miller-Rabin primality test. The code does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the areas where the suspected vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786) are present. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications to address the suspected vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  The code does not contain any obvious security issues, but it is always a good idea to review the code for any potential security risks.
