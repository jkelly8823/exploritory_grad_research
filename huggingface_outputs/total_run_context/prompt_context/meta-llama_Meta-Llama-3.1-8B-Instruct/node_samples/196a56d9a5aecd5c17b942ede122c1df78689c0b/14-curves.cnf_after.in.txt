 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun due to the use of an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46) in the certificate name constraint checking. This can be triggered by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as using a secure coding practice or a library that provides protection against buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a different certificate verification library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
4. Ensure that the server requests client authentication only when necessary and that the client is properly configured to handle client authentication. 
5. Regularly update and patch the system to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 
6. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent buffer overflows, such as using a library that provides protection against buffer overflows. 
7. Consider using a different programming language or framework that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
8. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date.
