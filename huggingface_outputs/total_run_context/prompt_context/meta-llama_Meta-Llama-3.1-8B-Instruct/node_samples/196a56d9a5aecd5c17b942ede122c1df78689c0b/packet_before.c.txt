 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the put_value function. The function does not check the length of the data to be written, and the WPACKET_allocate_bytes function does not check if the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the data is larger than the allocated memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the data before writing to it.
2. Use a safer function to allocate memory, such as malloc or calloc, which can handle errors and provide more control over memory allocation.
3. Consider using a buffer overflow protection mechanism, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Data Execution Prevention (DEP), to prevent buffer overflows from being exploited. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct
