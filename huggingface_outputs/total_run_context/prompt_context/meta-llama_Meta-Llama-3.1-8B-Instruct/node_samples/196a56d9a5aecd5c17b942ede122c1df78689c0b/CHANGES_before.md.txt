 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, the description of the vulnerabilities mentions a bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions, which was introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.4. This bug is not related to the code sample provided, but it is mentioned in the changes between 3.0.4 and 3.0.5.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no specific recommendations for this code sample, as it does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known bugs or vulnerabilities are fixed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
