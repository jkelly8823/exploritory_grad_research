 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the "mgf1-digest" algorithm, which can be triggered by a malicious certificate. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46) on the stack, resulting in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as stack overflow protections.
3. Validate user input to prevent malicious certificates from being accepted.
