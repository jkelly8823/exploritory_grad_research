 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the X.509 certificate verification process. Specifically, the `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_string` function is used to extract a string from a parameter, but the buffer size is not checked properly. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated buffer size. In this case, the `mdname` and `mdprops` buffers are not checked for overflow, and the `str` pointer is assigned to point to these buffers without checking their lengths. This can cause a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the buffer sizes before assigning the `str` pointer to point to the `mdname` and `mdprops` buffers.
2. Use a safer function to extract the string from the parameter, such as `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_string_buf` which allocates a buffer of the correct size.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle the input string, such as using a fixed-size buffer and checking for overflow before assigning the `str` pointer.
