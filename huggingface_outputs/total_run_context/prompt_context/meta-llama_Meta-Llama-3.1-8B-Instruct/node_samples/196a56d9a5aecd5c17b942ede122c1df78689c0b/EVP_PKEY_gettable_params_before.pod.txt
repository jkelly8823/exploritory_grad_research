 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (curve_name[64]) to store an arbitrary-length string. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a crash or denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a dynamically-sized buffer to store the curve name.
- Validate the length of the curve name before storing it in the buffer.
- Consider using a safer alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern cryptography library.
