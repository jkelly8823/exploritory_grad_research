 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the buffer overrun issues described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with cryptographic operations and certificate verification. The code does not contain any functions or variables that are directly related to the name constraint checking or buffer overflow vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is always recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
