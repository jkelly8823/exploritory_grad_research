 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14/None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `load_serial` function, which can potentially overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Use a secure method to load serial numbers, such as using a secure library or implementing a custom solution that avoids the use of `load_serial`. 
4. Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  VULNERABLE: YES
