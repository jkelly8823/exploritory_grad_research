 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `ossl_cms_ctx_get0_libctx` function, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review and update the code to ensure that it is using the latest and most secure versions of the OpenSSL library.
