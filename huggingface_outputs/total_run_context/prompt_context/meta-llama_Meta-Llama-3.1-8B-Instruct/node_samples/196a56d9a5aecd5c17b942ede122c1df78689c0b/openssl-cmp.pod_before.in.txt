 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `PKCS#10 CSR` option, which can be used to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure version of OpenSSL, such as 3.0.7 or later, which fixes the vulnerability.
- Validate the input to the `PKCS#10 CSR` option to prevent buffer overflows.
- Consider using a more secure method for certificate verification, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.
