 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overruns described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates for any libraries or frameworks used in the code. In this case, the code appears to be part of the OpenSSL library, which has already been patched for these vulnerabilities.  The code sample does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overruns described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.  The code sample appears to be a header file that defines function prototypes and structures for the OpenSSL library. It does not contain any executable code that could be vulnerable to these issues.  The code sample does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore,
