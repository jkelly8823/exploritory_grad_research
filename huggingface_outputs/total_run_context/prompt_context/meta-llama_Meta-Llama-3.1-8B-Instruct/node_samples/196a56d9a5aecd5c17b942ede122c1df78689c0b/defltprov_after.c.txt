 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically related to the registration of message digest functions. There is no evidence of any code that could be used to craft a malicious email address or trigger a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service)
