 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the name constraint checking of X.509 certificate verification. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication. The buffer overrun could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. However, many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent certificate chain signature verification failure.
3. Use a secure random number generator to generate the IV.
4. Use a secure method to store and manage the session data.
