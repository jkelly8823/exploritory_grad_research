 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any direct calls to X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit() which is the function that is vulnerable to the buffer overrun. The code does provide information on how to use this function, but it does not contain any code that would trigger the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to follow the guidelines provided in the code sample and use X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() or X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() instead of X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit(). This will help to prevent potential issues and ensure that the code is secure. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that both I<ctx> and its internal verification parameter pointer are not NULL before calling any of these functions.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct
