 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `load_serial` function, which can overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Use a secure method to load the serial number, such as using a fixed-size buffer and checking for buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the
