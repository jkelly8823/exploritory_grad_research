 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of BIO_pending(), BIO_ctrl_pending(), BIO_wpending(), and BIO_ctrl_wpending() functions which can potentially overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack. This can result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL (3.0.7 or later) to fix the vulnerability.
- Avoid using the BIO_pending(), BIO_ctrl_pending(), BIO_wpending(), and BIO_ctrl_wpending() functions in critical code paths.
- Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.  ```python
