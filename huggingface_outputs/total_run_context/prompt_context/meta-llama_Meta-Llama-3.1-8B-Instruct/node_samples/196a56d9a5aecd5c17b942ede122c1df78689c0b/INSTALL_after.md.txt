 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun or other vulnerability. However, the code does contain a comment that mentions not building methods for specific protocol versions, which could potentially be a security risk if not implemented correctly. The lack of code in the sample makes it difficult to provide a more detailed explanation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement proper protocol version selection and handling to prevent potential security risks. This could include using a secure default protocol version or implementing a mechanism to allow users to select specific protocol versions. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly tested and reviewed to prevent any potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service
