 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the `confunc` function, which can lead to a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation for the `confunc` function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Consider using a safer alternative to `confunc` that does not rely on stack-based buffers.
3. Update the code to use a more secure version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow
