 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the inclusion of arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. 4. Avoid using the `.` character in certificates to prevent buffer overflows. 5. Implement additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to prevent buffer overflows. 6. Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL. 7. Review and update the code to use a secure version of OpenSSL. 8. Consider using a secure alternative to the `.` character in certificates. 9. Implement a secure way to handle certificate verification. 10. Review and update the code to handle certificate verification securely. 11. Consider using a secure alternative to the
