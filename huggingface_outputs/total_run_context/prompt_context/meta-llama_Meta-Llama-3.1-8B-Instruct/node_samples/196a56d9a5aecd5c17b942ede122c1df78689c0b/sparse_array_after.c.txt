 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the ossl_sa_free function. The function takes an OPENSSL_SA pointer as an argument and checks if it is not NULL. However, it does not check the size of the sa pointer before calling sa_doall. This can lead to a buffer overrun if the sa pointer is larger than expected, potentially causing a denial of service or remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a size check for the sa pointer before calling sa_doall.
2. Consider using a safer function to free the memory, such as OPENSSL_memset.
3. Review the sa_doall function to ensure it does not have any buffer overrun vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack
