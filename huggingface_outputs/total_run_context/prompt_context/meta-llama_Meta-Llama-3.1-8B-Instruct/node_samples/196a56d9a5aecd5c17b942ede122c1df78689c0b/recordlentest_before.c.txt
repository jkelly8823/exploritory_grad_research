 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the OpenSSL library, which is used in the code sample. The OpenSSL library is not properly handling the X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious email address to overflow the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that is not affected by the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities. Specifically, upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
2. Implement additional security measures to mitigate the risk of buffer overflows, such as stack overflow protections or address space layout randomization (ASLR).
3. Review and update the code to properly handle X.509 certificate verification and name constraint checking. This may involve using a more secure library or implementing custom certificate verification logic.
