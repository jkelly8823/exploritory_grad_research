 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun due to the use of the "n32" ABI, which can lead to a stack overflow. This is a known issue in the OpenSSL library, and it has been fixed in version 3.0.7. However, the code is using an older version of OpenSSL, which makes it vulnerable to this attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade to a newer version of OpenSSL, such as 3.0.7 or later, to fix this vulnerability. Additionally, consider using a different ABI, such as "linux64", to avoid this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially
