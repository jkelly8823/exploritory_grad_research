 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that would trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code sample appears to be a fragment of the OpenSSL library, but it does not include any code that would be susceptible to these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good idea to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches, especially for libraries like OpenSSL that are widely used and have a history of security vulnerabilities. Consider using a version of OpenSSL that has been patched for these vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.  Also, ensure that any custom code that interacts with OpenSSL is reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
