 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a buffer overrun vulnerability due to the lack of input validation in the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro. This macro is used to define the maximum chunk size for certain cryptographic operations. However, it is not checked or validated in the code, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and cause a denial of service or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed value.
2. Consider using a safer approach, such as using a fixed-size buffer or a dynamically allocated buffer with bounds checking.
3. Update the code to use a more secure version of the OpenSSL library that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
