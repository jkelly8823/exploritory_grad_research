 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code is using the OpenSSL library to perform certificate verification, but it does not contain any code that is susceptible to the buffer overflows described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described CVEs, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
