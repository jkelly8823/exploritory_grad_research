 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any explicit code that directly triggers a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. However, it does use the OpenSSL library, which is vulnerable to the described issue. The code is likely to be affected by the vulnerability if it is used to verify X.509 certificates.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that is not affected by the vulnerability (e.g., OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later).
2. Avoid using the OpenSSL library for X.509 certificate verification if possible.
3. If using the OpenSSL library, ensure that the version being used is patched against the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
