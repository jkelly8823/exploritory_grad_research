VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length function call, which can lead to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. This is because the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length function does not properly check the length of the IV, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious email address that can overflow the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as using a secure coding practice like buffer size checking.
3. Consider using a secure alternative to EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length, such as EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length_secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or
