 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a buffer overrun vulnerability due to the lack of input validation in the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro. This macro is used to define the maximum chunk size for certain cryptographic operations. However, it is defined as a power of 2 minus 2, which can lead to an overflow when used in certain contexts. This can result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro to use a more robust method for calculating the maximum chunk size, such as using a fixed value or a more secure method for calculating the maximum size based on the available memory.
2. Add input validation to ensure that the input size is within the valid range before performing any cryptographic operations.
3. Consider using a safer method for calculating the maximum chunk size, such as using a library-provided function or a more secure algorithm. 4. Review and update any code that uses the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro to ensure it is using the updated value correctly. 5. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure random number generator, to generate the EVP_MAXCH
