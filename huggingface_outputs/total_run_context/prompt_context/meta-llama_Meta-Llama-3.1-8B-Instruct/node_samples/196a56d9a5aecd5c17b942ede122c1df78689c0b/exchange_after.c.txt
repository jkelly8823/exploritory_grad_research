 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The function EVP_KEYEXCH_is_a() does not perform any bounds checking on the input string 'name', which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer function to perform the name constraint checking, such as EVP_KEYEXCH_is_a_safely().
- Add bounds checking to the input string 'name' to prevent buffer overflows.
- Consider using a more secure method to verify X.509 certificates, such as using a library that performs bounds checking and other security checks.
