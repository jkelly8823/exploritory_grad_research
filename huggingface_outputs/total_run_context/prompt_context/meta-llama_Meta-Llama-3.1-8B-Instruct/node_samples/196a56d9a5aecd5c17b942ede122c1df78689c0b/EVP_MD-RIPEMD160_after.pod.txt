 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code appears to be documentation for the RIPEMD-160 digest implementation in OpenSSL, and does not include any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, and no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep your OpenSSL version up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Consider upgrading to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
