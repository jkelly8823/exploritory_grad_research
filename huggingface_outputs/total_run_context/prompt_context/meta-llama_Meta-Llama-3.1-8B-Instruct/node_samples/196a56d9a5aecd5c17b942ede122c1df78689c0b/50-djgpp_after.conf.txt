 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun due to the use of the `.` character in the email address of a certificate. This can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication. The buffer overrun could result in a crash, causing a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure version of OpenSSL that has been patched for this vulnerability.
- Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent buffer overflows.
- Consider using a different certificate verification library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial
