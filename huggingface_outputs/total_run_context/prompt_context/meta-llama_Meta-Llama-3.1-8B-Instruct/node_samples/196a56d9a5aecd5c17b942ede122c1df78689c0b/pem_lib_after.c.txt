 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of BIO_write() function which can potentially overflow the stack with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL (version 3.0.7 or later) to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Use a secure coding practice to avoid buffer overflows, such as using safe string functions and checking the length of input data before writing it to a buffer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
