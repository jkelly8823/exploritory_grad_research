 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is for the OpenSSL command-line tool, which is a cryptographic library and toolkit. The code itself does not contain any vulnerable code, but rather provides a list of available commands, options, and parameters for the OpenSSL tool. The vulnerability descriptions provided (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786) relate to buffer overflows in X.509 certificate verification, which is not relevant to the provided code sample. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to these specific vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the provided vulnerabilities, and no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library and toolkit up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches and features. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
