 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the `tbs` parameter in the `ossl_ed25519_sign` and `ossl_ed448_sign` functions. An attacker can craft a malicious certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack, leading to a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Input validation should be added to the `tbs` parameter to prevent buffer overflows.
2. The `tbs` parameter should be checked for the presence of the `.` character (decimal 46) to prevent malicious certificates from being processed.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to the `ossl_ed25519_sign` and `ossl_ed448_sign` functions that do not have this vulnerability.
