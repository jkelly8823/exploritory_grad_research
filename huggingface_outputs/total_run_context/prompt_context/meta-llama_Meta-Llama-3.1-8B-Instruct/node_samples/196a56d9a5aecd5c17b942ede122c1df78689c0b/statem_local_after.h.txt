 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, but it does not include any functions or variables that are directly related to the vulnerable code paths mentioned in the CVE descriptions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations for fixes are necessary. However, it is still recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
