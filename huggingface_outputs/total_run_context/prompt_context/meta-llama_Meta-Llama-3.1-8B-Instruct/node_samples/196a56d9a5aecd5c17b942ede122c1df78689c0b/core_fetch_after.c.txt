 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. 
4. Ensure that the application continues certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. 
5. Implement a secure way to handle email addresses in certificates.
