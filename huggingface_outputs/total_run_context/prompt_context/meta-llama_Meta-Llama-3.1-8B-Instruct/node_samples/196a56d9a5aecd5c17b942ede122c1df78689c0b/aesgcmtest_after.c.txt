 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. The code appears to be a simple test suite for encryption and decryption functions, and it does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overflows described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to address the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to follow secure coding guidelines to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, but it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues and to use a code analysis tool to identify any potential security issues.
