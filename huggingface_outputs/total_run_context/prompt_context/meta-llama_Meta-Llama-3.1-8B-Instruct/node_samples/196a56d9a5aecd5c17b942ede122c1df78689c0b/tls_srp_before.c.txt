VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers/None
EXPLANATION:
Provide a more detailed explanation of your analysis here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include recommended fixes for this code.

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code is focused on creating a verifier for SRP (Secure Remote Password) authentication, and does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. The use of BN_clear_free and BN_new suggests that the code is using the OpenSSL library, but the specific functions and operations do not match the vulnerable code patterns described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Consider upgrading to the latest version of OpenSSL.  Consider using a secure random number generator to initialize the SRP context.  Consider using a secure method to store and handle the user and password inputs.  Consider using a secure method to handle the SRP
