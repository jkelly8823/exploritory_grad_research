 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `ossl_method_store_cache_get` function, which can potentially overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement a stack overflow protection mechanism to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the code to ensure that it does not use any other vulnerable functions or features. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could
