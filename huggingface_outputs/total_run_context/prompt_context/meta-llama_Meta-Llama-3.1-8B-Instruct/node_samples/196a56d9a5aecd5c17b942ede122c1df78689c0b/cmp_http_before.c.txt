 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the `body_type` parameter, which can be crafted to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation for the `body_type` parameter to ensure it does not exceed a certain length.
2. Use a safer function to copy the `body_type` parameter, such as `strncpy` instead of direct assignment.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a `struct` or `enum`, to represent the `body_type` parameter. This would help prevent buffer overflows and make the code more maintainable. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application
