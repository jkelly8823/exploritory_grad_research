EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the OpenSSL library, which is included in the code sample. The OpenSSL library is known to be vulnerable to these issues, and the code sample does not include any patches or fixes for these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not vulnerable to these issues. Specifically, update to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
2. Consider using a different library or implementation that is not vulnerable to these issues.
3. If updating the OpenSSL library is not feasible, consider applying the patches or fixes provided by the OpenSSL project to address these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a
