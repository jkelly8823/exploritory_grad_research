 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerabilities CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be a snippet from the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with the generation of a random number. The code does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the specific areas where the vulnerabilities occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial
