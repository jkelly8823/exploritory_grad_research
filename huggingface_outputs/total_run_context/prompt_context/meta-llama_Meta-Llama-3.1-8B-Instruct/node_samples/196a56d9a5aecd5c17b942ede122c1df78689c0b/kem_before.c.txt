 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `evp_is_a` function, which can be triggered by a malicious email address in a certificate. The buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review and update the code to ensure that it is using the latest and most secure versions of the OpenSSL library. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to
