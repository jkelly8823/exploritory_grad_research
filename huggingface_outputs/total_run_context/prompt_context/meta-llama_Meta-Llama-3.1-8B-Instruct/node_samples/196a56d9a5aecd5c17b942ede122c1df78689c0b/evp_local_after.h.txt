 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the given CVEs. The code appears to be a data structure for storing application-specific data and cipher-related information, but it does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overflows described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the given CVEs, so no recommendations for fixes are necessary. However, the FIXME comment suggests that the code may be unnecessary or unused, and it may be worth reviewing and potentially removing it to simplify the codebase.  ```
