 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 28-30
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the X.509 certificate verification process. Specifically, the `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_string` function is used to extract strings from the `params` structure, but the buffer sizes for `mdname` and `mdprops` are fixed and may not be sufficient to hold the extracted strings. This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a crash or remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the buffer sizes for `mdname` and `mdprops` to ensure they can hold the maximum possible string lengths.
2. Use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the extracted strings, rather than relying on fixed-size buffers.
3. Consider using a safer string extraction function that can handle variable-length strings, such as `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_stringz`. 

Note: The code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
