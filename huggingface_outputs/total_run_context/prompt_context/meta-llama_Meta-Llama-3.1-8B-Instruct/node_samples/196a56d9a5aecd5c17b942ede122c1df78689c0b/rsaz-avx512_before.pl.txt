 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any evidence of the suspected vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786). These vulnerabilities are related to buffer overflows in X.509 certificate verification, which is not present in this code sample. The code appears to be a Perl script that checks for the presence of AVX-512 instructions and uses them if available. It does not involve certificate verification or any other potential sources of buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential issues, especially when working with sensitive data or critical systems.  Please note that this code sample is a Perl script and does not involve any C or C++ code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described issues.  The code does not appear to be related to OpenSSL or any other library that could be vulnerable to these issues.  The code does not appear to be related to certificate verification or any other potential sources of buffer overflows.  The code does not appear to be related to any of the described
