 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the buffer overrun issues described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be related to installing and configuring the FIPS module and generating ordinal files for Windows platforms. There is no evidence of X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the specific areas where the vulnerabilities occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to review and update code regularly to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to further mitigate potential vulnerabilities.  Please note that the code sample is written in a Makefile format, which is not typically associated with X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. The vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs are more likely to be found in code that handles X.509 certificates and their verification.  Therefore, the code sample provided is not likely to be vulnerable to these specific issues.  However, it is always a good idea to review
