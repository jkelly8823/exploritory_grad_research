 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious buffer overruns or vulnerabilities related to the CVEs provided. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with Diffie-Hellman key exchange and named groups. The code defines macros and structures for working with named groups, but it does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the buffer overruns described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the
