 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation in the `get_decoder_from_store` function, which can lead to a buffer overflow when processing a malicious certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation in the `get_decoder_from_store` function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure method to handle certificate verification, such as using a library that provides secure certificate parsing and validation.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure coding framework or a code review process, to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could
