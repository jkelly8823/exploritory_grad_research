 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used cryptographic library. The functions provided are used to retrieve information about cipher contexts and EVP (Envelope-based Public Key Cryptography) objects. The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it does not introduce any new vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to
