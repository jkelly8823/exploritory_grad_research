 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a Perl script that tests the OpenSSL library. It appears to be a test suite for the dhparam CLI application. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786). The code is well-structured and follows best practices for Perl programming. However, it's worth noting that the code is using an older version of OpenSSL (3.0.6 or earlier), which may be vulnerable to the issues described in the CVEs. It's recommended to upgrade to a newer version of OpenSSL to ensure security.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a newer version of OpenSSL (3.0.7 or later) to ensure security.
2. Review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to the use of older versions of OpenSSL.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure programming language for future development.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification
