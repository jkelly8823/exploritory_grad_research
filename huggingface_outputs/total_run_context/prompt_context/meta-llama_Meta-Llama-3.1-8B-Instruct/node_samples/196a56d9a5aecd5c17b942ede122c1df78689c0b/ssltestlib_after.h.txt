 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. However, the code does contain a function called `mempacket_test_inject` which could potentially be used to inject malicious data into a BIO (Basic Input/Output) structure. This could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the `mempacket_test_inject` function to ensure that it properly sanitizes any user-input data.
- Consider adding additional checks to prevent buffer overruns when injecting data into the BIO structure.
- Ensure that any data injected into the BIO structure is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
