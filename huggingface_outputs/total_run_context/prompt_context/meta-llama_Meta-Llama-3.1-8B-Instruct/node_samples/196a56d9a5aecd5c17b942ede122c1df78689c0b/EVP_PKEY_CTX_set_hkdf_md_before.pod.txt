 

VULNERABLE: YES/NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers/None
EXPLANATION:
Provide a more detailed explanation of your analysis here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include recommended fixes for this code. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code is related to HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) and does not involve name constraint checking or certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any fixes. 

Note: The code sample is a snippet from the OpenSSL library, specifically from the EVP_PKEY_HKDF implementation. The code is designed to handle HKDF operations and does not involve X.509 certificate verification. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overrun issues described in the provided CVEs.
