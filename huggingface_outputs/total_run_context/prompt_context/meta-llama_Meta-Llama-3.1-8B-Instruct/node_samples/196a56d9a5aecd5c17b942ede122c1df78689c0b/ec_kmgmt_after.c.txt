 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code is focused on handling EC keys and does not involve name constraint checking or certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates for any libraries or dependencies used in the code. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to further protect against potential vulnerabilities.  ```python
