 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code appears to be a header file for OpenSSL, and it does not include any functions that perform certificate verification. The functions in this header file seem to be related to FFC (Fast Flexible Cipher) parameters and named groups, which are not related to certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the library itself are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is using the OpenSSL library correctly and securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes
