 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any functions that are related to the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. These vulnerabilities are related to X.509 certificate verification and name constraint checking, which is not present in the provided code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable functions, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  The functions used in this code sample are all related to cryptographic operations and do not appear to be related to the vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs.  It is possible that the code sample is using a different version of OpenSSL that has already fixed these vulnerabilities.  Further analysis would be required to determine the exact version of OpenSSL being used.  In any case, the code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs.  It is always a good idea to review the code and ensure that it is secure and up to date.  This can be done by reviewing the code and ensuring that it
