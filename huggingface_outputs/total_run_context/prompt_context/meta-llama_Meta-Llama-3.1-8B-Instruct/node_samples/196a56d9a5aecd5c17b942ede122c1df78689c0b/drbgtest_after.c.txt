 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. The code appears to be focused on testing and verifying the functionality of the OpenSSL library, particularly in regards to the FIPS provider and the continuous random number generator (CRNG) tests. The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities that would be related to the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its security and functionality. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date with the latest security patches and updates.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack
