 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code is written in Perl and does not contain any C code that would be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. The code is also using the OpenSSL library, which has been fixed in version 3.0.7 to address these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to these specific vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are addressed. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in
