 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun or other type of vulnerability related to the provided CVEs. The code appears to be related to compiler-specific initialization and cleanup, and does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or other relevant functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep code up to date and follow secure coding guidelines to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  The code does not contain any obvious security issues, but it is always a good idea to review and test the code thoroughly before deployment.
