 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. However, it does include a reference to the OpenSSL library, which is a common implementation of X.509 certificate verification. Given the descriptions of CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, it is likely that the OpenSSL library is vulnerable to these issues if it is not up-to-date. Therefore, the code sample is vulnerable to these issues due to its reliance on the OpenSSL library.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not affected by CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. This can be done by installing a newer version of the OpenSSL library or by using a different library that is not vulnerable to these issues.
2. Consider using a different library or implementation for X.509 certificate verification that is not vulnerable to these issues. This may require significant changes to the code, but it can provide a more secure solution.
3. Implement additional security measures to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities, such as input validation and error handling. This can help to prevent attacks even
