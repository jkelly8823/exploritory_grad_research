 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of the vulnerable functions (e.g., name constraint checking) that are associated with CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. However, it does include OpenSSL library headers, which may indirectly introduce vulnerabilities if not properly handled. The code itself appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, and the vulnerabilities are likely to be addressed in the library's implementation rather than in this specific code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the OpenSSL library is up-to-date, as the vulnerabilities are fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7.
2. Review the library's documentation and implementation to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are properly addressed.
3. Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL if possible. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
