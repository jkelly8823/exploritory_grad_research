 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a part of the OpenSSL library, which is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows in X.509 certificate verification. The specific vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 are related to name constraint checking, which can be triggered by a malicious certificate. Although the code sample does not directly contain the vulnerable code, it is part of the OpenSSL library that is affected by these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7.
2. Consider using a different library or implementation that is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
3. If upgrading or switching libraries is not feasible, consider implementing additional security measures to mitigate the risk of buffer overflows, such as stack overflow protections. 4. Regularly review and update the library to ensure it remains secure. 5. Consider using a secure coding practice to prevent buffer overflows. 6. Use a secure coding tool to detect and prevent buffer overflows. 7. Implement a secure coding
