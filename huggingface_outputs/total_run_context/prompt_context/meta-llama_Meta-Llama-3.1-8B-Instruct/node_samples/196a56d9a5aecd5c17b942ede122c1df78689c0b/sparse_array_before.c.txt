 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the ossl_sa_free function. The sa_doall function is called with a callback function that takes a pointer to a node, but the node is not checked for null before being passed to the callback function. This could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if the node is null. Additionally, the OPENSSL_free function is called without checking if the pointer is null, which could also lead to a buffer overrun.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the node for null before passing it to the sa_doall function.
2. Check the pointer before calling OPENSSL_free to ensure it is not null.
3. Consider using a safer function to free the memory, such as OPENSSL_memset and OPENSSL_free, to ensure that the memory is properly cleared before freeing it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure
