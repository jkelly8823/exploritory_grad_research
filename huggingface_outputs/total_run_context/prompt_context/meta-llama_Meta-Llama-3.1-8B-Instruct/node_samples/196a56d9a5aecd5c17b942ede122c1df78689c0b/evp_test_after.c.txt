 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper bounds checking when processing the `expected->alg` variable, which can lead to a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper bounds checking for the `expected->alg` variable to prevent buffer overflows.
2.  Use a safer alternative to `OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string` to avoid potential buffer overflows.
3.  Consider using a more secure method to handle the `expected->alg` variable, such as using a fixed-size buffer or a safer string handling function.
4.  Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security standards.
