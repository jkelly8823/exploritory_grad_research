 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the email address in the certificate. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46) on the stack, resulting in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include input validation for the email address in the certificate. This can be achieved by checking the length of the email address and ensuring it does not exceed a certain limit. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a more secure method for verifying X.509 certificates, such as using a library that provides robust certificate verification. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
