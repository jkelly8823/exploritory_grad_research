 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of bounds checking on the `p` variable, which can lead to a stack overflow. The `SSL_CIPHER_get_name(c)` function can return a string that is longer than the buffer allocated for `p`, causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add bounds checking on the `p` variable to prevent buffer overflows.
- Use a safer function to retrieve the cipher name, such as `SSL_CIPHER_get_name_len(c)` to get the length of the name before retrieving it.
- Consider using a more secure way to handle the `p` variable, such as using a `std::string` or a `char*` with a fixed size. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a
