 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the SRP_create_verifier_BN_ex function which can potentially overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure version of the SRP_create_verifier_BN_ex function that is not vulnerable to buffer overflows.
- Implement a stack protector to prevent buffer overflows.
- Consider using a secure alternative to SRP_create_verifier_BN_ex. 
- Regularly update the library to the latest version to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```python
