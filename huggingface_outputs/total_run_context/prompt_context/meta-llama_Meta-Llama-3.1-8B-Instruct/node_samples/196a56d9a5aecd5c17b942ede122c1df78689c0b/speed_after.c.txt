 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the EVP_PKEY_derive function. The outlen variable is set to MAX_FFDH_SIZE, but it can be overwritten with a too small value, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in a crash or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to set the outlen variable, such as using a constant value or a secure function to determine the required buffer size.
2. Consider using a secure function to derive the secret, such as EVP_PKEY_derive2, which provides additional security features.
3. Ensure that the buffer size is checked and validated before using it to prevent buffer overflows.
