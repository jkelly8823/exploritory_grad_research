 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of OPENSSL_strndup() which can potentially overflow the stack with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement a stack overflow protection mechanism to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Use a secure string duplication function that does not have the potential to overflow the stack. 
4. Validate the input to OPENSSL_strndup() to prevent malicious input from causing a buffer overflow. 
5. Consider using a secure alternative to OPENSSL_strndup() such as OpenSSL's built-in string duplication function.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
