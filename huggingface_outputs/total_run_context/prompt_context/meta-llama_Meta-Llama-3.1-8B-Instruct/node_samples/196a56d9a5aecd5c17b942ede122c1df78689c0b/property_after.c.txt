 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to contain any obvious buffer overruns or vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. The code is primarily focused on implementing a method store for OpenSSL, which is a complex task that involves managing a cache of algorithms and handling various locking mechanisms. While the code does contain some potential issues, such as the use of deprecated functions and lack of error handling, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the specific CVEs listed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code for potential issues related to the use of deprecated functions and lack of error handling.
2. Consider using more modern locking mechanisms, such as mutexes or spinlocks, instead of the deprecated CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_new() and CRYPTO_THREAD_lock_free() functions.
3. Implement more robust error handling mechanisms to ensure that the code can handle unexpected errors and exceptions.
4. Consider using a more secure random number generator, such as the OpenSSL RAND_bytes() function, instead of the deprecated OPENSSL_rdtsc() function. 
5. Review the code for potential issues related to the use of static variables and global state. 
6. Consider using a more secure way to store and retrieve
