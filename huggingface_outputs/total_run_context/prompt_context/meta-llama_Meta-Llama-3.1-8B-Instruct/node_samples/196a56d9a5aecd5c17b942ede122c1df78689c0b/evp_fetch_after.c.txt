 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `.` character (decimal 46) in the `reserve_evp_method_store` function, which can cause an arbitrary number of bytes to be written to the stack. This can result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a safer method for storing and retrieving EVP methods, such as using a secure buffer or a more robust data structure.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent buffer overflows, such as checking the length of the input data before writing it to the stack.
3. Consider using a more secure method for mixing the name identity with the operation identity, such as using a cryptographic hash function.  VULNERABLE: YES
