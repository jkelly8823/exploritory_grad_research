 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a shell script that appears to be building and testing the cryptography library. It does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The vulnerabilities are related to X.509 certificate verification, which is not relevant to this script. The script is focused on building and testing the cryptography library, and does not involve any certificate verification or parsing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the cryptography library is up-to-date and patched against any known vulnerabilities. Additionally, the script should be reviewed for any potential security issues specific to its functionality.  The script does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities, but it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential security issues.
