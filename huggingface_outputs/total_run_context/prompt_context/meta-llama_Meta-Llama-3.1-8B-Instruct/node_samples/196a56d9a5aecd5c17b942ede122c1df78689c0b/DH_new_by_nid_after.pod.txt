 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be documentation for deprecated functions in OpenSSL 3.0, and does not include any executable code that could be vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code, and no recommendations are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the documentation for the OpenSSL library to ensure that any deprecated functions are properly replaced with newer, secure alternatives.
