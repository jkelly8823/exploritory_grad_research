 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the vulnerabilities listed. However, the presence of the FIPS version check and the use of the DES-EDE3-ECB cipher, which is known to have a bug in the IV length, suggests that the code may be vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack. The bug in the IV length is a known issue in the FIPS version 3.0.0, which is indicated by the FIPSversion variable being set to greater than 3.0.0. This could potentially allow an attacker to craft a malicious IV that overflows the buffer, leading to a denial of service or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the FIPS version to a version that does not have the bug in the IV length.
2. Use a different cipher that is not known to have any bugs in the IV length.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as bounds checking and input validation.
