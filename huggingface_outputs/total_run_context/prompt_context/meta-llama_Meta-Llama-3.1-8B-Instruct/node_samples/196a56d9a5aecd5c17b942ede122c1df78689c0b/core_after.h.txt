 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the given CVEs. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with method construction and algorithm handling. The structure and function definitions do not seem to be directly related to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. However, it is essential to note that the absence of vulnerabilities in this code snippet does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities in the entire OpenSSL library or other parts of the codebase.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The provided code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the given CVEs. However, it is recommended to review the entire codebase and ensure that all necessary security patches and updates are applied to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure coding practice and following the guidelines provided by the OpenSSL library to ensure the overall security of the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
