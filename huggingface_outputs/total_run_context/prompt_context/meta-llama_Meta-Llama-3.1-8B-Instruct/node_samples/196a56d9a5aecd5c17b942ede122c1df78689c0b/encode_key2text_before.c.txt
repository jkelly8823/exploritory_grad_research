 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the `params` variable, which can lead to a buffer overflow when calling `ffc_params_to_text(out, params)`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add input validation for the `params` variable to ensure it does not contain any malicious data.
- Consider using a safer function to handle the `params` variable, such as one that uses a buffer size check to prevent buffer overflows.
- Update the code to use the latest version of the OpenSSL library, which includes fixes for the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to
