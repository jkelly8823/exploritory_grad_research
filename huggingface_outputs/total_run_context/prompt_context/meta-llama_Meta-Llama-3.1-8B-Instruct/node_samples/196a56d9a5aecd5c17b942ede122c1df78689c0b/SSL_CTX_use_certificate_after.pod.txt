 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the SSL_CTX_use_cert_and_key() function, which can be triggered by a malicious certificate. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL (version 1.0.2 or later) to take advantage of the separate chain store for each certificate type.
2. Use the SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file() function instead of SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file() to allow the use of complete certificate chains.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent buffer overflows.
