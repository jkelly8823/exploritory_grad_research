 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any explicit code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, the code does appear to be related to cryptographic operations, which could potentially be vulnerable to other types of attacks. The use of hardcoded values for the shared secret and peer key may also be a security concern.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the shared secret and peer key.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive values such as the shared secret and peer key.
3. Consider using a more secure key derivation function, such as HKDF.
4. Ensure that the cryptographic operations are properly implemented and validated to prevent other types of attacks.
