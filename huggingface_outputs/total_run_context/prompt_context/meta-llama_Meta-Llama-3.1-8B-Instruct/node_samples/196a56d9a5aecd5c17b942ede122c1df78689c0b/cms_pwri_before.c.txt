 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of RAND_bytes_ex function which can potentially overflow the stack with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure random number generator that is not vulnerable to buffer overflows.
- Consider using a secure alternative to RAND_bytes_ex, such as a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
- Ensure that the stack layout is secure and does not allow for buffer overflows. 
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.  ``` VULNERABLE: YES
