 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `memcpy` function without bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `aad_len` variable is larger than the size of the `buf` array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `memcpy_s` instead of `memcpy` to ensure bounds checking.
- Check the size of the `buf` array before copying data into it.
- Consider using a safer function like `strncpy` to copy strings.
