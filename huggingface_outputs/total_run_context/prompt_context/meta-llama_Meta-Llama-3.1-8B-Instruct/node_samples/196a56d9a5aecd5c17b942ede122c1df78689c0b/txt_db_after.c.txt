 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of BIO_gets() function which can lead to a buffer overflow when reading data from a BIO (Basic Input/Output) stream. The BIO_gets() function reads data from the BIO stream and stores it in a buffer, but it does not check the length of the data being read, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is longer than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like BIO_read() or BIO_gets_ex() which can handle the length of the data being read.
2. Check the length of the data being read before storing it in the buffer.
3. Use a fixed-size buffer instead of a dynamically allocated buffer to prevent buffer overflows.
4. Consider using a more secure way to handle X.509 certificate verification, such as using a library that provides secure certificate verification functions.
