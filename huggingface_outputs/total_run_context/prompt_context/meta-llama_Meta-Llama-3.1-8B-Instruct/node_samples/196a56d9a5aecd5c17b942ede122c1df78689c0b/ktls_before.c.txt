 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `crypto_info->cipher_algorithm` variable. An attacker can craft a malicious certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack, leading to a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input to the `crypto_info->cipher_algorithm` variable to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure coding practice, such as using a fixed-size buffer and checking the length of the input before copying it to the buffer.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the `crypto_info->cipher_algorithm` variable, such as using a secure string library or a more secure data structure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification
