 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the buffer overrun issues described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be using the OpenSSL library to generate and check public keys, but it does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the specific areas where the vulnerabilities occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described issues, so no recommendations for fixes are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
