 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. The code is focused on defining and using named groups for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. The buffer overruns described in the CVEs are not present in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the
