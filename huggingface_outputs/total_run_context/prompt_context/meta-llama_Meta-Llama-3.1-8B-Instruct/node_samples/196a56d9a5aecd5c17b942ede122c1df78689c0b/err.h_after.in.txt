 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically a header file containing error code definitions. The code does not contain any user-written code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. The code is focused on defining error codes and does not involve any dynamic memory allocation or string manipulation that could lead to buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are provided as the code snippet does not contain any user-written code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, it is essential to follow secure coding practices when writing user-written code to prevent vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE-2022-3602, CVE-2022-3786.  These vulnerabilities are related to buffer overflows in the OpenSSL library, specifically in the X.509 certificate verification process. The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to these issues.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to these specific vulnerabilities.  However, it is essential to note that the OpenSSL library itself may still be vulnerable to these
