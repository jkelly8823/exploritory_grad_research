 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any instances of the suspected vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786). The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with SSL/TLS record processing and encryption. The code does not contain any buffer overflows or name constraint checking that could lead to the described vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any instances of the suspected vulnerabilities, and no changes are necessary to mitigate these vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date with the latest security patches to ensure the overall security of the system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash
