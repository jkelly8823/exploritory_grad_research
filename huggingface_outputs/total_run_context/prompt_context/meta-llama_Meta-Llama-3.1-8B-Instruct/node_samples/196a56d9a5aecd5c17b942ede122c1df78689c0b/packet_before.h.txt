 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation in the `PACKET_get_net_4` function, which can lead to a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation to the `PACKET_get_net_4` function to ensure that the input packet is not too large.
2. Use a safer function to read data from the packet, such as `PACKET_peek_1`.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle packet data, such as using a buffer with a fixed size.
