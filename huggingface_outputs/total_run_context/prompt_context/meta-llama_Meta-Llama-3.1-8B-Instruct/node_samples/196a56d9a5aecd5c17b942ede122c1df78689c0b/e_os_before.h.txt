 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code snippet is related to OpenSSL and defines a function for sleeping, but it does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the areas where the vulnerabilities are present.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep your OpenSSL version up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Consider upgrading to a newer version of OpenSSL if possible.  The code snippet is not related to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The vulnerabilities are related to X.509 certificate verification and name constraint checking, which are not present in this code snippet. The code snippet is related to OpenSSL but it is not vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code snippet is a system-specific variant defining ossl_sleep() function. The code snippet does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code snippet is not related to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The code snippet is a system-specific variant defining ossl_sleep()
