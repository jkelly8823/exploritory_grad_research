 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. However, the code does include a comment referencing the OpenSSL project, which is a library that has been affected by the vulnerabilities listed. This suggests that the code may be using OpenSSL, and therefore may be vulnerable to these issues if not properly configured or updated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code to ensure that it is using the latest version of OpenSSL.
2. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a library that is not affected by these vulnerabilities.
3. If using OpenSSL, ensure that it is properly configured and updated to mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities.
