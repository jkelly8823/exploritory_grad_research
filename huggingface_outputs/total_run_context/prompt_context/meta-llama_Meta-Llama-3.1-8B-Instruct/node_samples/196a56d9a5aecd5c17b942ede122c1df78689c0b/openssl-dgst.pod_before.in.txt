 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `.` character (decimal 46) in the email address of a certificate, which can cause an arbitrary number of bytes to be written to the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure version of OpenSSL, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
- Avoid using the `.` character in email addresses in certificates.
- Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
