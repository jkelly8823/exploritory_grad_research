 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a part of the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used cryptographic library. The functions and variables used in this code are related to elliptic curve cryptography and key management. Upon reviewing the code, there is no indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability, which is the primary concern of the CVEs listed. The code appears to be well-structured and follows standard practices for secure coding.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. However, it is always recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, developers should follow secure coding practices and guidelines when working with cryptographic libraries.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
