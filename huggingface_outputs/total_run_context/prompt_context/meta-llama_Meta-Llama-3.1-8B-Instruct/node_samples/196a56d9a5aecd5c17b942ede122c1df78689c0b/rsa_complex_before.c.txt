 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code includes OpenSSL headers but does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to use the latest version of OpenSSL to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices to prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities in the future.
