 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a set of functions for manipulating and comparing X.509 certificate times. It does not appear to contain any buffer overruns or other vulnerabilities that would be related to the CVEs listed. The functions are designed to handle ASN.1 time structures and perform various operations on them, such as comparison and adjustment. The code is well-structured and follows standard OpenSSL conventions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
