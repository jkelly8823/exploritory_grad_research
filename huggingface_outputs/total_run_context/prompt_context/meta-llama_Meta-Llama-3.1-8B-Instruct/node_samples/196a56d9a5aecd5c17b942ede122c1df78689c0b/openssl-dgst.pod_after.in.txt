 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code is related to setting the output length for XOF algorithms and does not involve any certificate verification or parsing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to follow the guidelines for setting the xoflen length for shake algorithms to ensure maximum security strength.
