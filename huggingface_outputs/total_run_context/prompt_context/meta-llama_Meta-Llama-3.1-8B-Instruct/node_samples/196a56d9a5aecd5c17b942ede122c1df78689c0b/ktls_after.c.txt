 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `crypto_info->iv_len` assignment. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack, leading to a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Validate and sanitize the input data before assigning it to `crypto_info->iv_len`.
2.  Use a secure method to handle the `.` character in the email address, such as using a whitelist or a regular expression to ensure it does not exceed a certain length.
3.  Consider using a more secure cipher suite, such as AES-256-GCM, to reduce the risk of buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have
