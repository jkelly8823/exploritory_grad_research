 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper bounds checking in the X509_NAME_oneline function, which can lead to a stack overflow when processing a malicious certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement proper bounds checking in the X509_NAME_oneline function to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Use a secure method to handle certificate verification, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could
