 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a series of test functions for OpenSSL, and does not contain any code that would trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest OpenSSL version to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future.  It is also recommended to use a secure coding tool to scan the code for potential vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed by a security expert to ensure that it is secure.
