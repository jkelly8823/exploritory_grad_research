 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation on the `prm->data` field, which can lead to a stack overflow when processing a malicious certificate. The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, but it is not a direct copy of the code. The code checks for the presence of the `.` character (decimal 46) in the `prm->data` field, but it does not validate the length of the input. An attacker can craft a malicious certificate with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character, which can cause a buffer overflow on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the length of the `prm->data` field to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure function to parse the `prm->data` field, such as `ossl_ffc_name_to_dh_named_group` with proper error handling.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a buffer with a fixed size, to store the `prm->data`
