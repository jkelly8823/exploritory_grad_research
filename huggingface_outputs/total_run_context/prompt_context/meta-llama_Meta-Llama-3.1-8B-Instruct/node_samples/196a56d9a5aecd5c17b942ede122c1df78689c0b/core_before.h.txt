 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the given CVEs. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with method construction and algorithm handling. The structure and function definitions do not seem to be directly related to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. However, it is essential to note that the absence of vulnerabilities in this code snippet does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities in the entire OpenSSL library or its usage in other parts of the codebase.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The provided code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the given CVEs. However, it is recommended to review the entire codebase and ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest security patches, especially for the OpenSSL library. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
