EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains several vulnerabilities that match the descriptions of CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code has several instances of buffer overflows, which can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication. The buffer overflows can result in a crash or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate the risk.
4. Consider using a more secure library or framework to handle X.509 certificate verification. 
5. Ensure that the code is properly formatted and follows best practices for coding style and security. 

Note: The code sample provided is a modified version of the OpenSSL code, and the vulnerabilities mentioned are based on the descriptions of CVE-2022-
