 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `PACKET_get_length_prefixed_2` function, which can overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement a stack overflow protection mechanism to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate the risk.
4. Consider using a more secure alternative to `PACKET_get_length_prefixed_2`, such as a function that uses a safer parsing mechanism. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, as described in CVE-2022-3602. This is because the code does not use the
