 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. However, it does contain some potential issues such as the use of deprecated functions and the lack of error handling in some places. The code also appears to be a test suite for the OpenSSL library, and as such, it is likely that the vulnerabilities listed in the CVEs are not directly applicable to this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code for any potential issues related to the use of deprecated functions.
2. Add error handling to the code to ensure that any errors that occur are properly handled and reported.
3. Consider using more modern and secure practices when working with the OpenSSL library.
4. Review the code for any potential issues related to the use of the OpenSSL library's functions and APIs. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
