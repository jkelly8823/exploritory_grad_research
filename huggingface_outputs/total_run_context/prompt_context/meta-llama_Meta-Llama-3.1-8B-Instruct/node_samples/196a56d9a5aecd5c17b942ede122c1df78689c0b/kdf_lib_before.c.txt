 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The functions EVP_KDF_is_a and EVP_KDF_get0_provider do not appear to be related to certificate verification or name constraint checking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and follow secure coding guidelines.  Further analysis of the code is required to ensure it does not contain any other vulnerabilities.  The code sample appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used and trusted library.  However, it is always a good idea to review the code and ensure it meets the security requirements of the project.
