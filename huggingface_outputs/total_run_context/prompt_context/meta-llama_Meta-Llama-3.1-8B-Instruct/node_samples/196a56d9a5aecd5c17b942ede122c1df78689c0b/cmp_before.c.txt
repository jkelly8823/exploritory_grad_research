 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of OPENSSL_zalloc, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the allocation fails. The code does not properly check the return value of OPENSSL_zalloc, which can result in a crash or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of OPENSSL_zalloc and handle the error properly.
2. Use a safer allocation function, such as OPENSSL_malloc, which can handle errors more robustly.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure way of handling memory allocation, such as using a memory pool or a smart pointer. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to CVE-2022-3786, as it does not involve crafting a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character on the stack. The code does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
