 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a set of functions for examining and manipulating stacks of extensions in X.509 certificates and CRLs. The functions are designed to be used directly to examine the extensions, rather than to parse or encode and add an extension. The code does not appear to contain any buffer overruns or other vulnerabilities that could be triggered by a malicious certificate or CRL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious actor. However, it is always a good idea to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to follow best practices for secure coding. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
