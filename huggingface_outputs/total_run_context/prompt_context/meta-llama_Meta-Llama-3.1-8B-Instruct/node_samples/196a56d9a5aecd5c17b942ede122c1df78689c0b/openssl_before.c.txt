VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. However, it does include a reference to the OpenSSL library, which is a common implementation of X.509 certificate verification. Given the descriptions of CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, it is likely that the OpenSSL library is vulnerable to these issues if it is not up-to-date. Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later to address the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
- Ensure that the OpenSSL library is properly configured and initialized to prevent potential issues.
- Consider using a more modern and secure library for X.509 certificate verification if possible.
