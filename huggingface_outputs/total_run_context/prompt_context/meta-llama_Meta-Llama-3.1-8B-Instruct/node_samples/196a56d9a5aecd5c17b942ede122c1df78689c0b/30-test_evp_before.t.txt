 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. However, it does include a list of files that are likely related to cryptographic functions, which could potentially be used in a vulnerable implementation. The lack of specific code makes it difficult to determine the presence of the suspected vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the presence of these files suggests that the code may be vulnerable to the described issues if it is used in conjunction with a vulnerable implementation of X.509 certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code for any direct implementation of X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking.
2. Ensure that any cryptographic functions used are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a secure and trusted library for cryptographic functions to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
