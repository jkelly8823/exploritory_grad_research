 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the email address in the certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement input validation for the email address in the certificate.
- Use a secure library for certificate verification, such as OpenSSL.
- Consider using a secure protocol for communication, such as TLS 1.3.
