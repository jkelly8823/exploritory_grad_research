 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the OpenSSL library, which is used in the code sample. The vulnerability is a buffer overrun that can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This can result in a crash or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that is not affected by the vulnerability, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
2. Use a secure coding practice to prevent buffer overflows, such as using a safe string library or implementing bounds checking.
3. Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
