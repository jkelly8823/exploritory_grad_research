 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that directly implements X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. The code is focused on testing the OpenSSL library's functionality, specifically related to generating RSA keys with different bit lengths and checking the FIPS provider's behavior. The vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 are related to X.509 certificate verification, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code related to the provided CVEs. However, it is recommended to ensure that any code that implements X.509 certificate verification is properly updated to the latest version of OpenSSL to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is essential to follow secure coding practices and regularly review code for potential vulnerabilities.
