 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the WPACKET_put_bytes__ function. The function allocates memory for the packet using WPACKET_allocate_bytes and then calls put_value to store the value in the allocated memory. However, the put_value function does not perform any bounds checking on the value being stored, which can lead to a buffer overrun if the value is larger than the allocated memory. This is a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the put_value function to ensure that the value being stored does not exceed the allocated memory.
2. Consider using a safer function to allocate memory, such as one that uses a secure allocator or checks for memory exhaustion.
3. Review the WPACKET_allocate_bytes function to ensure that it correctly handles memory allocation and deallocation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to
