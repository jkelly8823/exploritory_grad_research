 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a buffer overrun vulnerability in the sub ::endbranch function. The &::data_byte function is used to write 4 bytes to memory, but the function does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause a crash or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer function to write data to memory, such as &::data_word or &::data_dword.
- Add bounds checking to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the data.
- Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a buffer size parameter to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the data. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on
