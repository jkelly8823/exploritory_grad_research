 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to contain any obvious buffer overruns. The functions s390x_x25519_mul and s390x_x448_mul are used to perform cryptographic operations, and the code checks for errors in these operations. However, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specific buffer overruns described in the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep up-to-date with the latest security patches and to regularly review code for potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure coding standard and code review process to ensure the code remains secure.
