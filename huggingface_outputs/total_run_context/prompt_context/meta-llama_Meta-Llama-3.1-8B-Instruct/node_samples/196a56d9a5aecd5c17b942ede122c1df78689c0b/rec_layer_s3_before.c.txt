 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the code. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the X.509 certificate verification process.
2. Use a secure library or framework that handles X.509 certificate verification securely.
3. Regularly update and patch the OpenSSL library to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service)
