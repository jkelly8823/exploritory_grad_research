 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the code. The code does not check the length of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow when processing malicious input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure coding practice, such as bounds checking, to ensure that the input data does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure X.509 certificate verification, such as OpenSSL.
