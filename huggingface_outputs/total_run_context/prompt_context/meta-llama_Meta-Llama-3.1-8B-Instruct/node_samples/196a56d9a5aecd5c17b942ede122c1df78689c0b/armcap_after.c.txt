 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the code. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for X.509 certificate verification.
2. Use a secure library or framework that handles X.509 certificate verification securely.
3. Enable stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
4. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that fixes the vulnerability (OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later).
