 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `params` array, which can be crafted to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method to validate the `params` array, such as checking its length and contents before passing it to the `selection` function.
- Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a hash table or a binary search tree, to store and retrieve parameters.
- Upgrade to a newer version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft
