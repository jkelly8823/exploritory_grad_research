 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically the CMS_verify() function. This function is designed to verify a CMS SignedData structure. The code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices for secure coding. However, the function does have some limitations, such as not searching the trusted certificate store for the signing certificate, which is due to the inadequacies of the current X509_STORE functionality. Additionally, the lack of single pass processing means that the signed content must all be held in memory if it is not detached. These limitations do not appear to be related to the vulnerabilities listed in the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the code and consider implementing additional security measures to address the limitations mentioned above. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities listed in the provided CVEs. The code does not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities, and the function is designed to handle large amounts of data.
