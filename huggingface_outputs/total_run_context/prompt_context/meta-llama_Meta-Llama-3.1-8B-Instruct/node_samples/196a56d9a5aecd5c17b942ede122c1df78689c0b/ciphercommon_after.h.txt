 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the inclusion of the OpenSSL library, which is known to be vulnerable to this issue. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Consider using a different library or implementation that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
4. Review and update the code to ensure that it is using the latest and most secure version of the OpenSSL library. 
5. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent buffer overflows. 
6. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as secure coding guidelines, to prevent buffer overflows. 
7. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as secure coding standards, to prevent buffer overflows
