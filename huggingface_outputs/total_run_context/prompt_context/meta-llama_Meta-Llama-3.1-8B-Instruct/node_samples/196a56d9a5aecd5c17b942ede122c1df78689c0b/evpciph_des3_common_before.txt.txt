 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The code appears to be a simple encryption test using DES EDE3 ECB, and does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or other code that could be vulnerable to the described issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities and does not require any fixes.  The code is a simple encryption test and does not involve any code that could be vulnerable to the described issues.  However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices.  In this case, the code is not vulnerable to the described issues, but it is still a good idea to review the code and ensure that it is secure.  Additionally, it is a good idea to use secure encryption algorithms and to follow best practices for encryption.  In this case, the code uses DES EDE3 ECB, which is an older encryption algorithm and may not be as secure as more modern algorithms.  Consider using a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES.  However, this is not
