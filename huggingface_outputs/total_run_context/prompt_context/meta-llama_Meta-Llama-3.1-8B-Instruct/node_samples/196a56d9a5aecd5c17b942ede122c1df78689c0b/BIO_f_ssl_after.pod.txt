 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of BIO_new_fp(stdout, BIO_NOCLOSE) which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use BIO_new_fp(stdout, BIO_NOCLOSE) with caution and ensure that the buffer size is properly set.
- Consider using a more secure method for creating the BIO object, such as using BIO_new(BIO_s_mem()) and then setting the output stream using BIO_set_fp().
- Upgrade to a newer version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash
