 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
- Implement additional security measures such as stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
- Ensure that the application continues certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer only when necessary and with proper validation.  ```bash
