 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. The code appears to be a test case for loading FIPS and non-FIPS parameters in OpenSSL, and it does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overflows described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to address the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  The code should be reviewed for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues.  The use of the FIPS mode should be reviewed to ensure it is being used correctly and securely.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure it is handling errors and exceptions correctly.  The use of environment variables to set the OpenSSL configuration file should be reviewed to ensure it is secure and not vulnerable to any potential attacks.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure it is following secure coding practices.  The code should be reviewed to ensure it
