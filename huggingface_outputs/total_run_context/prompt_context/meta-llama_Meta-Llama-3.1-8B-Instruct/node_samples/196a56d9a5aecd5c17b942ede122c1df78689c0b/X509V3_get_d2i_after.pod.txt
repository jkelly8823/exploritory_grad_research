 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper validation of the extension specific structure I<ext_struc> in the X509V3_EXT_i2d() function. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack, leading to a crash or denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the X509V3_EXT_i2d() function should be modified to properly validate the extension specific structure I<ext_struc> and prevent buffer overflows. This can be achieved by using a safe string copying function, such as strcpy_s() or strncpy(), to copy the extension data into a buffer of a fixed size. Additionally, the function should check for any errors that may occur during the decoding process and return an error if necessary. The X509_EXTENSION objects allocated by X509V3_add1_i2d() and its variants should also be explicitly freed using X509_EXTENSION_free() to prevent memory leaks.
