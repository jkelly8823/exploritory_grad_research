 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code appears to be a version string and metadata for a software release, and does not include any code that would be executed during certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to keep software up to date with the latest security patches to ensure the overall security posture of the system.
