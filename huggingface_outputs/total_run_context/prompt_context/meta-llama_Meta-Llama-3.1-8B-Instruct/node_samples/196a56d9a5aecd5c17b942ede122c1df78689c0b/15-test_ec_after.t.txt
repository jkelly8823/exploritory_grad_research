 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that directly interacts with X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. The code is focused on testing the functionality of the OpenSSL library, specifically the pkey and pkeyutil commands. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVEs listed.
