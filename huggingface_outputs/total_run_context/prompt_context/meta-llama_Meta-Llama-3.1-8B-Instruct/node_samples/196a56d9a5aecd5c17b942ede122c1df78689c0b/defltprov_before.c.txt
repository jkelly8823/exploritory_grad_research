 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the X.509 certificate verification process, specifically in name constraint checking. The code is using the OpenSSL library, which is affected by these vulnerabilities. The vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that is not affected by these vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a different library or implementation for X.509 certificate verification that is not affected by these vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to
