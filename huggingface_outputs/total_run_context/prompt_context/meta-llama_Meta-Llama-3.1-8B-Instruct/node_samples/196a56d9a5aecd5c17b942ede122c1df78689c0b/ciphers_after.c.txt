EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. The code is vulnerable because it does not properly check the length of the SSL_CIPHER_get_name(c) function, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure function to get the name of the SSL cipher, such as SSL_CIPHER_get_name_len(c) to get the length of the name and then use a buffer of that size to store the name.
2. Use a secure function to copy the name of the SSL cipher, such as SSL_CIPHER_get_name_copy(c, buffer, buffer_size) to copy the name into a buffer of a known size.
3. Use a secure function to get the name of the SSL cipher, such as SSL_CIPHER_get_name(c) and then check
