 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a build and test script for the cryptography library. It does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVEs listed. The script is written in shell script and does not contain any C or C++ code that would be susceptible to buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the listed CVEs. However, it is recommended to keep the script up to date and use the latest version of the cryptography library to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure method to install and manage dependencies, such as using a package manager or a dependency manager like pip.  The use of `rm -rf` is also a potential security risk and should be avoided. It is recommended to use a more secure method to remove directories, such as `rm -r` with the `-i` option to prompt for confirmation.  The use of `python -m venv` is also a good practice to create a virtual environment for the project.  The use of `pip install -U pip` is also a good practice to keep pip up to date.  The
