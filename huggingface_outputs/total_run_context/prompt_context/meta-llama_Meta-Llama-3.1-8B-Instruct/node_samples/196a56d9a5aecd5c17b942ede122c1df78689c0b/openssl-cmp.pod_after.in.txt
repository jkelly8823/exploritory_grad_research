 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
- Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
- Use a secure method to verify X.509 certificates, such as using a trusted certificate authority.
