 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that any code that performs X.509 certificate verification is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential buffer overflows.  Additionally, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  The OpenSSL library is used in this code sample, and it is recommended to use the latest version of the library.  The latest version of the OpenSSL library can be obtained from the official OpenSSL website.  It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice such as code review and testing to ensure that the code is free from vulnerabilities.  The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities, but it is still recommended to follow secure coding practices to ensure the security of the code.
