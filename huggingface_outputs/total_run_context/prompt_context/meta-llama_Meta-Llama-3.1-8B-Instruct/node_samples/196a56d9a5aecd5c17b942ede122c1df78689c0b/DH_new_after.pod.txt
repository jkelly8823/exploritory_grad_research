 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. However, it does include functions that are deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, which may indicate a potential vulnerability if the code is not properly updated to use the newer functions. The functions DH_new and DH_free are deprecated and can be hidden by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value. This suggests that the code may be vulnerable to a buffer overrun if it is not properly updated to use the newer functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use the newer functions provided by EVP_PKEY-DH(7).
2. Define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value to hide the deprecated functions.
3. Review the code to ensure that it is properly updated to use the newer functions and is not vulnerable to a buffer overrun. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for
