 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of bounds checking on the `sn` and `ln` variables, which can lead to a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add bounds checking on the `sn` and `ln` variables to prevent buffer overflows.
- Consider using a safer function to allocate memory for `sn` and `ln`, such as `OPENSSL_malloc` instead of `malloc`.
- Review the code to ensure that all potential buffer overflows are addressed.
