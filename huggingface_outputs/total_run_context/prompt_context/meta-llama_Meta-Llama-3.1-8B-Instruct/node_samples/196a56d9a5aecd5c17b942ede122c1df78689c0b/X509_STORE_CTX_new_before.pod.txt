 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that directly calls X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit(). Instead, it provides information on how to use this function and suggests that applications should call X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() or X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() instead. Therefore, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the issues described in the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code and does not appear to be related to the issues described in the provided CVEs. However, it is recommended to follow the suggested best practices and use X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() or X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() instead of X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit(). This will help to ensure that the purpose and trust values are set correctly and securely.  The code sample does not contain any code that directly calls X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit().
