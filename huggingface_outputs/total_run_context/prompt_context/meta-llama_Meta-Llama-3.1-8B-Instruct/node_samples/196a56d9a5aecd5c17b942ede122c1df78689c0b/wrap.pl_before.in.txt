 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any obvious buffer overruns or vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. The code is focused on error handling and subprocess execution, and does not involve X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the provided vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep code up-to-date with the latest security patches and best practices.  Please ensure that the Perl interpreter and any dependencies are up-to-date.  Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to further harden the code.  Consider using a secure coding framework or guidelines to ensure the code is secure.  Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider implementing a secure coding policy and training developers on secure coding practices.  Consider implementing a code review process to ensure code quality and security.  Consider using a secure coding standard such as the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Guide.  Consider implementing a vulnerability management process to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner.  Consider implementing a security awareness program to educate developers on security best
