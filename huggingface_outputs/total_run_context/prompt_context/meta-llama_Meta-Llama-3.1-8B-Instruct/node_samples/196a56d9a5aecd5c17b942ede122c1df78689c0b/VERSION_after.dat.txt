 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code appears to be a version string and metadata for a software release, and does not include any code that would be executed during certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to keep software up to date with the latest security patches to ensure the overall security posture of the system.  Consider upgrading to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.  Also, ensure that the system is configured to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.  This can be done by setting the appropriate flags in the TLS library.  Consult the documentation for the specific TLS library being used for more information.  Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to prevent potential attacks.  This can include validating and sanitizing user input, as well as implementing secure coding practices.  Consult the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Guide for more information.
