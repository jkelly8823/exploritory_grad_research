 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of OPENSSL_strndup() which can potentially overflow the stack with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement a stack overflow protection mechanism to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Use a secure string duplication function that does not have the potential to overflow the stack. 
4. Validate the input to OPENSSL_strndup() to prevent buffer overflows. 
5. Consider using a safer alternative to OPENSSL_strndup(), such as OPENSSL_strdup() or a custom implementation. 
6. Review the code to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other buffer overflows or security issues. 
7. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure string library or a memory-safe language. 
8. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 
9. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify
