 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun vulnerability such as CVE-2022-3602 or CVE-2022-3786. The code is focused on testing the loading of FIPS and non-FIPS parameters in OpenSSL, and does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to these specific vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is secure and does not require any changes to address the vulnerabilities mentioned. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any other potential security issues.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities.
