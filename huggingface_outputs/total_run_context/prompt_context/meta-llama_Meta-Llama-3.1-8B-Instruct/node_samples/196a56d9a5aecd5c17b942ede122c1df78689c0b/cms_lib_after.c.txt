 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is present in the X.509 certificate verification process, specifically in name constraint checking. The code does not properly handle the verification of email addresses in certificates, which can lead to a buffer overflow on the stack. This can result in a crash or potentially remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as stack canary protection or address space layout randomization (ASLR).
3. Review and update the code to properly handle email address verification in certificates. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a
