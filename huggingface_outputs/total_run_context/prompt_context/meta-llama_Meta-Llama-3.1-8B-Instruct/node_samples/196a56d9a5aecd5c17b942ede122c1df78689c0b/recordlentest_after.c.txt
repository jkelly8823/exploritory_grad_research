 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation in the `create_ssl_ctx_pair` function, which can lead to a malicious certificate being passed to the `TLS_server_method` and `TLS_client_method` functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the `create_ssl_ctx_pair` function to ensure that it does not contain any malicious certificates.
2. Update the OpenSSL library to the latest version, which includes a fix for the CVE-2022-3602 vulnerability.
3. Consider using a more secure method for creating SSL/TLS contexts, such as using a secure random number generator to generate the context.
