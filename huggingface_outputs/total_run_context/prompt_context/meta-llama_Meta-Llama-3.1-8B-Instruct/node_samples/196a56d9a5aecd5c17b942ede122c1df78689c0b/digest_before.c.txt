 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically handling the initialization and cleanup of the EVP_MD_CTX structure. The checks for the EVP_MD_CTX_FLAG_NO_INIT flag and the EVP_ORIG_METH origin are present, but they do not seem to be related to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The code also properly frees the fetched digest and sets it to NULL when necessary.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack
