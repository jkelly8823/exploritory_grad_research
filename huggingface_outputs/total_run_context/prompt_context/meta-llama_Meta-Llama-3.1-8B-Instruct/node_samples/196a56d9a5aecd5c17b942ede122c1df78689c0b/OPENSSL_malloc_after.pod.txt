 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code appears to be documentation and configuration examples for OpenSSL's memory debugging features, and does not contain any code that could be executed or parsed in a way that would trigger these vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. However, it is still recommended to keep OpenSSL up to date with the latest security patches to ensure the security of the system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.
