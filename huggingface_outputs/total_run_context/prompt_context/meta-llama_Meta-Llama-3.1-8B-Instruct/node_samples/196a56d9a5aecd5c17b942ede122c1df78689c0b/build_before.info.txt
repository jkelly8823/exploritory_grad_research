 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a buffer overrun vulnerability in the name constraint checking of X.509 certificates. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious email address in a certificate that overflows an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate the risk.
4. Consider disabling the vulnerable code path or implementing additional security measures to prevent the buffer overrun. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the `stack_test.c` file, which is included in the `DEPEND` list of the `stack_test` program. The vulnerable line is line 14 of the `stack_test.c` file.
