 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious buffer overruns or vulnerabilities related to the CVEs provided. The code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with EVP (Encryption and Decryption) contexts. The functions provided are used to create, manage, and set parameters for EVP contexts. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs provided, such as buffer overruns or incorrect handling of certificate verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is always recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices and to regularly review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
