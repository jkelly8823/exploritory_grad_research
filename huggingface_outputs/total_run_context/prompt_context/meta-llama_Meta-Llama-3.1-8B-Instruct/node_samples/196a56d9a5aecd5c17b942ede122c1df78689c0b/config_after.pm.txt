 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `.` character (decimal 46) in a certificate email address, which can overflow an arbitrary number of bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL, specifically version 3.0.7 or later, which fixes this vulnerability.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate the risk.
4. Consider using a more secure method for certificate verification, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a
