 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a part of the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used cryptographic library. The functions in this code sample are used for elliptic curve cryptography and do not appear to be vulnerable to the buffer overruns described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The functions are designed to handle cryptographic data and do not contain any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not require any changes to mitigate the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. However, it is always recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date with the latest security patches.
