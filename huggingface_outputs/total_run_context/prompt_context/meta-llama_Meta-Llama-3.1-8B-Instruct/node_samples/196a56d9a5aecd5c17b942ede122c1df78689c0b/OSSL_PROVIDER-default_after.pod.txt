 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking, which are the specific areas where the vulnerabilities CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 can be triggered. However, the code does contain a reference to the RIPEMD160 digest, which was added to the default provider in OpenSSL 3.0.7. This could potentially be used to trigger the buffer overrun vulnerability CVE-2022-3602, but it would require a specific and complex sequence of events. Therefore, while the code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-3602, it is not directly vulnerable to CVE-2022-3786.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later to address the vulnerability CVE-2022-3602.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent the buffer overrun vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 from being triggered, such as using a secure coding practice to prevent stack-based buffer overflows. 
- Review and update the code to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other potential security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
