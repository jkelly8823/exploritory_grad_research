 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would trigger a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification. The code is focused on generating a Diffie-Hellman key pair using the OpenSSL library, and does not involve certificate verification or parsing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any other potential security issues.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities.
