 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The function SMIME_crlf_copy(data, p7bio, flags) is called which can potentially overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the stack layout for any given platform/compiler to further mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. 
4. Consider using a secure alternative to SMIME_crlf_copy(data, p7bio, flags) that does not have this vulnerability. 
5. Ensure that the application continues certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer only if necessary and with
