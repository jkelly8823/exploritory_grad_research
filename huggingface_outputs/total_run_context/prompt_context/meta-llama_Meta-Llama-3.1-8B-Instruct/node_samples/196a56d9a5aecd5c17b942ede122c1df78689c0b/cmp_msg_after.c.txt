 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious email address in a certificate that overflows an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL as soon as possible.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
3. Ensure that the stack layout for any given platform/compiler does not facilitate remote code execution.
4. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious email addresses from being used in certificates. 
5. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL for certificate verification.  VULNERABLE: YES
