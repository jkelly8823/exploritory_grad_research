 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `BN_clear_free` function, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow. The `BN_clear_free` function is used to clear and free the memory allocated for the `BIGNUM` object holding the secret scalar. However, if the `BIGNUM` object is not properly initialized, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to clear and free the memory allocated for the `BIGNUM` object, such as `BN_clear` followed by `BN_free`.
2. Ensure that the `BIGNUM` object is properly initialized before using it.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the secret scalar, such as using a secure random number generator to generate the scalar. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA
