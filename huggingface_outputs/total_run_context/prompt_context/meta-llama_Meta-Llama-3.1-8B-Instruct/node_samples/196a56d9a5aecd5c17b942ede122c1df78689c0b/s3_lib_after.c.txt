 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that could be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code is checking for the presence of a specific SHA-256 digest in the SSL cipher, which does not seem to be related to the buffer overrun vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its security. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may
