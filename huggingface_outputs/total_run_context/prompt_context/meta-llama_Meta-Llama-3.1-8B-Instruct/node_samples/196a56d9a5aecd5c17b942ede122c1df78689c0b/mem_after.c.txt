 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any vulnerable code. The functions CRYPTO_mem_debug_push, CRYPTO_mem_debug_pop, and CRYPTO_mem_debug_malloc are all related to memory debugging and do not appear to be related to the vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs. The CVEs describe vulnerabilities in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code and does not require any fixes. However, it is always a good practice to keep code up to date with the latest security patches and to follow secure coding practices.  The code sample does not appear to be related to X.509 certificate verification, but it is still a good idea to review the code for any potential security issues.  Consider using a secure coding tool to review the code and provide recommendations for improvement.  Additionally, consider implementing memory debugging and other security features to help prevent vulnerabilities in the future.
