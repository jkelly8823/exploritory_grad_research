 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_DIGESTS` option, which can be exploited by an attacker to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the `OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ADD_ALL_DIGESTS` option to prevent the buffer overrun vulnerability.
- Consider using a secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern cryptography library.
- Ensure that the library is properly configured and initialized to prevent similar vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This
