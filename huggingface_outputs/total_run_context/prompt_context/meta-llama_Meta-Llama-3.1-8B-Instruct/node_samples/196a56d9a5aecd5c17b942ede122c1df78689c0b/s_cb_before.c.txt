 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `BIO_puts` function, which can overflow the stack with an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46). This can result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer function like `BIO_write` instead of `BIO_puts` to prevent buffer overflows.
- Consider using a more secure way to handle certificate verification, such as using a library that provides secure certificate verification functionality.
- Make sure to handle errors properly and do not continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
