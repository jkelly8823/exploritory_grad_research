 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the CVEs listed. The code appears to be a test script for OpenSSL, and it does not contain any code that performs X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL version up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack
