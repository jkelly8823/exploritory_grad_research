 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the implementation of the `MIDR_CPU_MODEL` macro, which can be crafted to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (e.g., OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later).
2. Implement additional security measures, such as stack overflow protections, to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review and update the code to ensure that it is not vulnerable to this issue.
