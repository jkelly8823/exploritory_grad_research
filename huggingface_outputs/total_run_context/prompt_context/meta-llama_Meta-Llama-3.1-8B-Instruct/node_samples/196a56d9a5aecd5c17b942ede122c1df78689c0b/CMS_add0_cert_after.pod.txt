 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a Perl module for handling CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) messages. It does not appear to contain any code that could be vulnerable to the buffer overflows described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code is focused on adding and retrieving certificates and CRLs from CMS messages, and does not involve any X.509 certificate verification or name constraint checking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up to date and follow best practices for secure coding.  The code is well-documented and follows good coding practices.  It is also worth noting that the code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which is a permissive free software license.  The code is also part of the OpenSSL project, which is a widely used and trusted cryptographic library.  Therefore, it is likely that the code is secure and can be used with confidence.  However, it is always a good idea to perform a thorough security audit and testing before using any code in a production environment.
