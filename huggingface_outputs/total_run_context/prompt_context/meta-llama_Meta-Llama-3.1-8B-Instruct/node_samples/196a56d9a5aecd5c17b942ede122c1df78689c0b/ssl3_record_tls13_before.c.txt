 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `email` field in the certificate. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character on the stack, leading to a crash or denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the OpenSSL library to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786 (OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later).
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization of the `email` field in the certificate.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern TLS library that includes robust input validation and sanitization. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to
