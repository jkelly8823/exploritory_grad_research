 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization in the code. The code does not check the length of the input filename, which can lead to a buffer overflow when processing the input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add input validation and sanitization to ensure that the input filename is within a safe length.
- Use a secure function to calculate the MAC, such as OpenSSL's EVP_MAC_CTX_new function.
- Consider using a more secure method to handle standard input, such as using a secure buffer to store the input data.
