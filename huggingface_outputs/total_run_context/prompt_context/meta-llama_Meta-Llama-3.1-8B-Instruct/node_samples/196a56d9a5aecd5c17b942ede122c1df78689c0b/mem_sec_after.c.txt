 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 vulnerabilities. The code includes a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server in a TLS client or by a malicious client connecting to a TLS server that requests client authentication. The buffer overrun can result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution, although stack overflow protections may mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Consider using a secure memory allocation library to prevent buffer overflows.
4. Regularly update and patch the OpenSSL library to ensure that any newly discovered vulnerabilities are addressed.
