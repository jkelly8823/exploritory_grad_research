 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the "acvp-info" parameter, which is an octet string containing some additional, mutually-known public information. This can be exploited by an attacker to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack, resulting in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
- Avoid using the "acvp-info" parameter unless absolutely necessary.
- Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows, such as stack overflow protections. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious
