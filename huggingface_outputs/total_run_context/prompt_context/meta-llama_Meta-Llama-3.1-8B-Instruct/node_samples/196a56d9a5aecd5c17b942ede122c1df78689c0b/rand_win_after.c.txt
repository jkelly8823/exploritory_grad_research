 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the buffer overrun vulnerability described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The vulnerability is present in the OpenSSL library, which is included in the code sample. The OpenSSL library is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server or by a malicious client connecting to a server that requests client authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that is not affected by this vulnerability. Specifically, upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
2. Consider using a different library or implementation that is not vulnerable to this issue.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent malicious input from causing buffer overflows.
