 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun due to the use of the "add" function in the cflags and cxxflags settings. This can lead to a crash or potentially remote code execution. The risk may be mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer alternative to the "add" function, such as a string concatenation or a list append operation.
- Consider using a more secure way to handle the cflags and cxxflags settings, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable.
- Upgrade to a newer version of the OpenSSL library to fix the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash
