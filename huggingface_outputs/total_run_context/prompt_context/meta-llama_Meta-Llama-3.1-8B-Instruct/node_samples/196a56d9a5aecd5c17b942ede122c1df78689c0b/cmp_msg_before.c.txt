 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious email address in a certificate that overflows an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL (version 3.0.7 or later) to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent malicious email addresses from being used to trigger the buffer overrun.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern cryptography library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 4. Ensure that the application continues certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer only when necessary and with proper validation. 5. Regularly review and update the application's security configuration to ensure
