 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The EVP_KEYMGMT_is_a function calls the evp_is_a function, which is not shown in the provided code sample. However, based on the description of the vulnerabilities, it is likely that the evp_is_a function performs name constraint checking, which is where the buffer overrun occurs. The evp_is_a function is called with a NULL pointer as the fourth argument, which is the name parameter. This could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if the name parameter is crafted to overflow the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786.
2. Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate the risk of remote code execution.
3. Review the evp_is_a function to ensure that it properly handles the name parameter to prevent buffer overruns.
