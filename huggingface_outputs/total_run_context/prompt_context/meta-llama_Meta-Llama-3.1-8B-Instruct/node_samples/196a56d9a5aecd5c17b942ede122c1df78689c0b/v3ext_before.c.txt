 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation in the `test_asid` function, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation to the `test_asid` function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer function to handle the `ASN1_OCTET_STRING_free` call, such as `ASN1_OCTET_STRING_free_safe`.
3. Consider using a more secure library or framework for certificate verification, such as OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
