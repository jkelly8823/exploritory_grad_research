 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that is vulnerable to the buffer overrun issues described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code is focused on processing and verifying S/MIME messages, and does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to craft a malicious email address or overflow arbitrary bytes on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to mitigate the vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing
