 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL 3.0.7 or later.
- Implement stack overflow protections to mitigate against the risk of remote code execution.
- Ensure that the stack layout for any given platform/compiler does not facilitate remote code execution.
