 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVEs listed. The code is using OpenSSL to generate and verify certificates, but it does not appear to be vulnerable to the buffer overflows described in CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786. The code is also using the `openssl` command to perform various certificate-related tasks, but it does not seem to be using any vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the vulnerabilities listed. However, it is always a good practice to keep OpenSSL up to date and to use the latest version available. Additionally, the code could benefit from additional error handling and logging to ensure that any issues that may arise are properly handled and reported.  The code could also benefit from code reviews to ensure that it is following best practices and is secure.  It is also recommended to use secure coding practices such as input validation and sanitization to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to use secure protocols such as TLS 1.2 or 1.3 to encrypt data in transit.  It is
