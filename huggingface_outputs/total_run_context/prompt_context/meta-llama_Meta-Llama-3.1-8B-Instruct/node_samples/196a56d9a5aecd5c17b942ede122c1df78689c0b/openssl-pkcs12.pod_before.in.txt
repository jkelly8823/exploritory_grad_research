 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the lack of input validation for the MAC digest algorithm and iteration count. An attacker can craft a malicious input to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack, resulting in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation for the MAC digest algorithm and iteration count to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure method to handle user input, such as sanitizing or escaping special characters.
3. Consider using a more secure library or framework that handles certificate verification and MAC digest algorithms securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker
