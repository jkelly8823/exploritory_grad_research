 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (curve_name) to store a potentially large string (the curve name). An attacker can craft a malicious curve name to overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a crash or denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a dynamically allocated buffer to store the curve name, rather than a fixed-size buffer.
- Consider using a safer function to copy the curve name into the buffer, such as strlcpy.
- Consider using a more secure method to verify X.509 certificates, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue.
