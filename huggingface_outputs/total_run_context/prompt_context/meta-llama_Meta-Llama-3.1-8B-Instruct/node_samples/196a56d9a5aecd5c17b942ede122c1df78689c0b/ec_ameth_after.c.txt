 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the `OBJ_nid2obj` function, which can return a NULL pointer or an object with a length of 0, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Check the return value of `OBJ_nid2obj` to ensure it is not NULL or an empty object.
2.  Use a secure function to allocate memory for the object, such as `OPENSSL_malloc`.
3.  Implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.
4.  Consider using a safer alternative to `OBJ_nid2obj`, such as `OBJ_obj2nid`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3602
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email
