 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially trigger a buffer overrun or other vulnerability. However, the code is related to SSL/TLS protocol configuration, which is a potential attack surface. The presence of the `no-{protocol}-method` directive suggests that the code is designed to prevent the use of specific protocol versions, which is a good practice. Nevertheless, the code does not address the specific vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVE descriptions (CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles X.509 certificate verification and name constraint checking.
2. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent buffer overflows and other attacks, such as input validation and sanitization.
3. Regularly update the code to the latest version of the OpenSSL library to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 4. Consider using a more secure alternative to OpenSSL, such as a modern TLS library. 5. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent the use of deprecated or insecure functions. 6. Use a secure coding practice to prevent the use of hardcoded credentials. 7. Implement
