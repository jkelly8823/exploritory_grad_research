 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the inclusion of the `#ifdef OPENSSL_SYS_VXWORKS` directive, which is a potential entry point for an attacker to craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `#ifdef OPENSSL_SYS_VXWORKS` directive to prevent potential buffer overflows.
2. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent malicious email addresses from being used to trigger the buffer overflow.
3. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious
