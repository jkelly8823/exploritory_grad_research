 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. This is due to the use of the 'z' modifier in the code, which is not supported in pre-C99 dialects. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the '.' character (decimal 46) on the stack, resulting in a crash (causing a denial of service).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a new version of OpenSSL that includes the fix for CVE-2022-3786.
2. Use a compiler that supports the 'z' modifier, such as GCC with the -std=c99 flag.
3. Remove the 'z' modifier from the code to prevent the buffer overrun. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-3786
CVE Description:
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a
