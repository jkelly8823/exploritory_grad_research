 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-38552 because it does not properly validate the integrity of the resource against a trusted manifest. The `InternalVerifyIntegrity` function checks the integrity of the resource by comparing the expected digest with the actual digest, but it does not check if the expected digest is valid or if it was generated by a trusted source. This allows an attacker to intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively disabling the integrity check.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the expected digest against a trusted manifest before comparing it with the actual digest.
2. Use a secure method to generate the expected digest, such as using a trusted source or a secure hash function.
3. Consider using a more secure integrity check mechanism, such as using a digital signature or a message authentication code (MAC).  ```c
void InternalVerifyIntegrity(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value>& args) {
  //...

  // Validate the expected digest against a trusted manifest
  if (!IsTrustedDigest(env, expected)) {
    return ThrowCryptoError(env, ERR_get_error(),
