 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-38552 because it uses the `internalVerifyIntegrity` function to check the integrity of a resource against a trusted manifest. However, the application can intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively disabling the integrity check. This is because the `internalVerifyIntegrity` function is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the integrity check.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the integrity check by verifying the checksum of the resource against a trusted source.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the integrity information, such as using a secure hash function.
3. Consider using a more secure policy mechanism, such as the `sri` module, which provides a secure way to verify the integrity of resources. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-38552
CVE Description:
When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against a trusted manifest, the application can intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively disabling the integrity check.
