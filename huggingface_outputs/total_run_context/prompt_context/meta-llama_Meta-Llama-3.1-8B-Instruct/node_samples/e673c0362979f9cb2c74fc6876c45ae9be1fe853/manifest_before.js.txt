 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-38552 vulnerability because it uses the `createHash` function to create a hash of the content, which can be intercepted by an attacker to return a forged checksum. This allows an attacker to bypass the integrity check implemented by the Node.js policy feature.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure hash function that is resistant to tampering, such as `crypto.createHash('sha256')`.
2. Verify the integrity of the content by checking the hash against a trusted manifest.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and verify the integrity of the content, such as using a digital signature. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-38552
CVE Description:
When the Node.js policy feature checks the integrity of a resource against a trusted manifest, the application can intercept the operation and return a forged checksum to the node's policy implementation, thus effectively disabling the integrity check.
Impacts:
This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 18.x and, 20.x.
