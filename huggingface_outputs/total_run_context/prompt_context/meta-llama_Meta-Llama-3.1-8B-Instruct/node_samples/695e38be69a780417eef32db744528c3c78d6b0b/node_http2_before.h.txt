 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could be exploited to cause a denial of service due to a flood of empty frames. The functions provided are frame handlers, which are responsible for processing incoming frames, but they do not appear to be vulnerable to the described attack. The code does not seem to be processing frames without the end-of-stream flag, nor does it seem to be spending excessive CPU time processing frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it is secure. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting or other measures to prevent abuse.
