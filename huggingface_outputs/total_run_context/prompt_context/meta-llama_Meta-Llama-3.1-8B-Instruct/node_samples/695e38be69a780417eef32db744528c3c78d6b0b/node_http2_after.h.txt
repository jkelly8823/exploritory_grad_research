VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-9518. However, it does contain function declarations for handling various types of HTTP/2 frames, which could potentially be used to process a flood of empty frames. To mitigate this, the implementation should include checks to prevent excessive processing of empty frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a frame processing rate limiter to prevent excessive CPU consumption.
2. Add a check to ignore empty frames or limit the number of frames processed within a certain time window.
3. Consider using a more efficient frame processing algorithm that can handle a high volume of frames without consuming excessive CPU resources.  ```c
// Example of a frame processing rate limiter
int maxFramesPerSecond = 100;
time_t lastFrameProcessed = time(NULL);
int framesProcessed = 0;

void HandleDataFrame(const nghttp2_frame* frame) {
  if (time(NULL) - lastFrameProcessed > 1) {
    lastFrameProcessed = time(NULL);
    framesProcessed = 0;
  }
  if (framesProcessed >= maxFramesPerSecond) {
    // Ignore this frame to prevent excessive processing
