EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9518, which is an HTTP/2 Empty DATA Frame Flooding vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag, causing the peer to spend time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth, potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the sending of empty frames without the end-of-stream flag.
2. Limit the number of frames that can be sent within a certain time frame to prevent excessive CPU usage.
3. Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse.  ```bash
