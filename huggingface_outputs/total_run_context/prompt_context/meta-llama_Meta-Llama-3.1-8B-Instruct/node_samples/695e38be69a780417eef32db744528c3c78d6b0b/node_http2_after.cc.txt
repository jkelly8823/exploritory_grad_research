VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9518 because it does not handle empty frames correctly. When an empty frame is received without the END_STREAM flag, the code considers it an error and returns 1. However, this does not prevent the peer from sending a flood of empty frames, potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ignore empty frames without the END_STREAM flag.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of empty frames received within a certain time window.
3. Consider using a more robust approach to handle empty frames, such as using a timer to detect and ignore repeated empty frames.  ```c
// Ignore empty frames without END_STREAM flag
if (frame->hd.length == 0 &&!(frame->hd.flags & NGHTTP2_FLAG_END_STREAM)) {
  return 0;  // Ignore empty frame
}

// Limit the number of empty frames received within a certain time window
int max_empty_frames = 10;
int empty_frames_received = 0;
if (frame->hd.length == 0 &&!(frame->hd.flags & NGHTTP2_FLAG_END
