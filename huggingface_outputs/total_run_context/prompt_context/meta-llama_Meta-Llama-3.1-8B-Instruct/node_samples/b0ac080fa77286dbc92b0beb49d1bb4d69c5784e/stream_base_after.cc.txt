 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. This is because the WriteWrap object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure without checking if the DoWrite method returned an error. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, the WriteWrap object is passed back to the caller, which may lead to memory corruption and potentially other exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of the DoWrite method to ensure it does not return an error before passing the WriteWrap object back to the caller.
2. Use a smart pointer to manage the WriteWrap object and prevent it from being deleted prematurely.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the WriteWrap object, such as using a unique_ptr or a shared_ptr.
