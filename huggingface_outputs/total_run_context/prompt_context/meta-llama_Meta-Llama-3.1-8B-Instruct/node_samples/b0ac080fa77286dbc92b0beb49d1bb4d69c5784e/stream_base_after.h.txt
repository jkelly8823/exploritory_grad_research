 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the potential for the WriteWrap object to be freed before it is used in the StreamWriteResult structure. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability, where a pointer to memory that has already been freed is used, leading to undefined behavior and potentially a Denial of Service or other exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a smart pointer to manage the WriteWrap object, ensuring it is not freed prematurely.
2. Use a reference counting mechanism to ensure the WriteWrap object is not deleted until it is no longer in use.
3. Avoid passing the WriteWrap object by pointer, instead consider passing it by value or using a reference. This will help prevent the object from being freed prematurely.
