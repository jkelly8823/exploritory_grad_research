 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. This is due to the fact that the WriteWrap object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure without checking if it has been freed. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially other exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the WriteWrap object has been freed before passing it back to the caller.
2. Use a smart pointer to manage the WriteWrap object and ensure it is properly deleted when no longer needed.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling TLS enabled sockets. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-8265
CVE Description: 
Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed
