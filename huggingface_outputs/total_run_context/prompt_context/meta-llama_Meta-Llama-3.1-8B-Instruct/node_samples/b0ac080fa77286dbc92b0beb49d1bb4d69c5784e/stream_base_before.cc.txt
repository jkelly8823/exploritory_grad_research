 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. This is because the WriteWrap object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure without checking if the DoWrite method returned an error. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, the WriteWrap object may be passed back to the caller even if it has already been freed, leading to a use-after-free bug.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of the DoWrite method before passing the WriteWrap object back to the caller.
2. Use a smart pointer to manage the WriteWrap object and ensure it is not deleted prematurely.
3. Consider using a more modern TLS implementation that is less prone to use-after-free bugs.  ```c
