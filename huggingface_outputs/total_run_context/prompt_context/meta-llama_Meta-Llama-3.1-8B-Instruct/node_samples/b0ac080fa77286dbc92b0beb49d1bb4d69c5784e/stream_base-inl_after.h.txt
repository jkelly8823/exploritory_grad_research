EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. This is due to the fact that the `req_wrap_obj` is being used after it has been reset or disposed of. Specifically, the `req_wrap_obj` is being used in the `DoShutdown` and `DoWrite` functions after it has been reset or disposed of in the `StreamReq::ResetObject` function. This can lead to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the `req_wrap_obj` is not used after it has been reset or disposed of.
2. Use a smart pointer to manage the `req_wrap_obj` and ensure that it is properly deleted when it is no longer needed.
3. Consider using a more robust TLS implementation that is less prone to use-after-free bugs. 
4. Review the code to ensure that all objects are properly deleted and not used after they have been deleted.
