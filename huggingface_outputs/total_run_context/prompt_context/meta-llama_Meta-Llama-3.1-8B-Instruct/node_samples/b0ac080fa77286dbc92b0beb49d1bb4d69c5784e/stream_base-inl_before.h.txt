 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. This is due to the fact that the `req_wrap_obj` is being used after it has been disposed of in the `DoShutdown` function. The `req_wrap_obj` is being used in the `DoWrite` function, which is called after `DoShutdown` has been called. This can lead to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the `req_wrap_obj` is not used after it has been disposed of.
2. Use a different object to store the result of `DoShutdown` to avoid using the disposed `req_wrap_obj`.
3. Consider using a smart pointer to manage the lifetime of the `req_wrap_obj` to avoid use-after-free bugs.
