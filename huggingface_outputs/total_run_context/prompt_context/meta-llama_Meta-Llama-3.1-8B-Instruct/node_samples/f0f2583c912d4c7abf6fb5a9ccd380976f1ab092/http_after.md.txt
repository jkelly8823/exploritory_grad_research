 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2019-15606 due to the presence of trailing white space in the HTTP header values. This is evident from the YAML comments that mention the support for the `insecureHTTPParser` option in Node.js versions 13.8.0 and 13.3.0, which is related to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (e.g., version 14 or later).
- Remove the trailing white space from the HTTP header values in the code.
- Consider enabling the `insecureHTTPParser` option to mitigate the vulnerability, but this is not recommended as it introduces a security risk.  ```bash
npm install node@14
``` ```javascript
// Remove trailing white space from HTTP header values
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json ',
  'Authorization': 'Bearer token '
};
``` ```javascript
// Enable insecureHTTPParser option (not recommended)
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer({
  insecureHTTPParser: true
});
``` ```bash
// Enable insecure
