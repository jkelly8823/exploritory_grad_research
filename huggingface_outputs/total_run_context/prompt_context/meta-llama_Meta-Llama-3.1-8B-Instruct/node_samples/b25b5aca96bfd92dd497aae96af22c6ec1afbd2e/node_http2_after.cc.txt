 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-27983 due to the potential race condition in the Http2Session destructor. When the destructor is called, it attempts to detach all Http2Stream instances and clear the streams_ map. However, it does not guarantee that the Detach() method will complete before the session_ is reset. This can lead to a situation where the Detach() method is still processing and storing data in memory, causing a race condition when the session_ is reset.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock or mutex to ensure that the Detach() method completes before resetting the session_.
2. Consider using a more robust way to handle the destruction of Http2Stream instances, such as using a shared_ptr or a custom deleter.
3. Add a check to ensure that the Detach() method has completed before resetting the session_. This can be done by adding a flag to the Http2Stream class to indicate whether it is still processing and storing data in memory.
