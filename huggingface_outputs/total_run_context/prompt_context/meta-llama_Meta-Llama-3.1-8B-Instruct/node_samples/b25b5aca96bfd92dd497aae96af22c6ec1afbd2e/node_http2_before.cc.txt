VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-27983 vulnerability. This is because the Http2Session destructor does not properly handle the case where the session is being reset while header frames are still being processed. This can lead to a race condition where data is left in nghttp2 memory after reset, allowing an attacker to make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a lock to the Http2Session destructor to ensure that it is not called while header frames are still being processed.
2. Use a more robust way to check if the session is being reset, such as using a flag or a callback.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure way to handle HTTP/2 sessions, such as using a library that provides built-in protection against this type of vulnerability.  ```c
Http2Session::~Http2Session() {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
  CHECK(!is_in_scope());
  Debug(this, "freeing nghttp2 session");
  // Explicitly reset session_ so the subsequent
  // current_nghttp2_memory_ check passes.
  session_.
