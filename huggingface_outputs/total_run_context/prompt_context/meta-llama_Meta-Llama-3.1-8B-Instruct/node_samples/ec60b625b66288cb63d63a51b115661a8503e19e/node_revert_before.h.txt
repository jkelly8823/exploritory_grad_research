 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The code appears to be a macro definition for a security revisions list, but it does not contain any executable code that could be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described CVEs. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of macros and preprocessor directives should be carefully considered to ensure that they do not introduce any security risks.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9512
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
