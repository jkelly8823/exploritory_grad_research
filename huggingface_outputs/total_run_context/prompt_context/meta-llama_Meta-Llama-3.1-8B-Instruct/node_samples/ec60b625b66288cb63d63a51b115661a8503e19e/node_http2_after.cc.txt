EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9512, a ping flood vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle the max_outbound_ack option, which can be set to a high value, potentially leading to a denial of service. The IsReverted function is used to check if the security revert for CVE-2019-9512 is enabled, and if so, it sets the max_outbound_ack option to 10000. However, this is not sufficient to prevent the ping flood vulnerability, as an attacker can still send a large number of pings to the peer, causing it to build an internal queue of responses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set the max_outbound_ack option to a reasonable value, such as 1, to prevent the ping flood vulnerability.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of pings that can be sent to the peer, such as a rate limiter.
3. Consider switching to a per-stream setting for the padding strategy, as mentioned in the code, to give users greater control over the padding mechanism. This could help to prevent the ping flood vulnerability by allowing users to set a lower
