 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any obvious references to HTTP/2 implementations or settings that could be exploited by the described vulnerabilities. The code appears to be focused on handling buffer indexing and padding strategies for DATA and HEADERS frames, which does not directly relate to the potential denial-of-service attacks described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is essential to ensure that the code is thoroughly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to further enhance the code's security posture.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9512
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
