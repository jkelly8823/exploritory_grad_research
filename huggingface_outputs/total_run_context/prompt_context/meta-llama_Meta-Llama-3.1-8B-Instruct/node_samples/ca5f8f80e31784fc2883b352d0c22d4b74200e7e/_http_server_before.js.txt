 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection due to the concatenation of user-controlled data (statusCode.toString()) with the CRLF constant. An attacker could manipulate the statusCode to inject a CRLF sequence, potentially leading to HTTP response splitting attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to concatenate strings, such as using a template literal or a library like sprintf.
2. Validate and sanitize user-controlled input to prevent CRLF injection.
3. Consider using a more secure method to generate the status line, such as using a library like http-status-codes.
