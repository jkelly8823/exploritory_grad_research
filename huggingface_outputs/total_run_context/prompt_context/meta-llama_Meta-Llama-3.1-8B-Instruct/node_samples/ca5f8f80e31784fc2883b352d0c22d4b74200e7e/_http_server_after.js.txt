 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CRLF injection due to the concatenation of user-controlled input (this.statusMessage) with the CRLF constant. An attacker could manipulate the statusMessage to inject a CRLF sequence, potentially leading to HTTP response splitting attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a library or function that properly escapes or sanitizes user-controlled input to prevent CRLF injection.
- Consider using a template engine or a string formatting library to separate the status code and message from the CRLF sequence.
- Ensure that the statusMessage is properly validated and sanitized before concatenating it with the CRLF constant.
