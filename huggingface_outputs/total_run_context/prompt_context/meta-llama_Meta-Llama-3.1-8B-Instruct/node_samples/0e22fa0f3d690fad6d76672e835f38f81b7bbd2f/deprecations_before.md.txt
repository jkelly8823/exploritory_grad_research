EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is not the actual code that is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22930. However, the code sample is related to the `punycode` module, which is a dependency of Node.js. The vulnerability is related to Node.js itself, not the `punycode` module. Therefore, the code sample does not contain the vulnerability, but it is related to the module that is vulnerable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, update Node.js to version 16.6.0 or later, 14.17.4 or later, or 12.22.4 or later.
