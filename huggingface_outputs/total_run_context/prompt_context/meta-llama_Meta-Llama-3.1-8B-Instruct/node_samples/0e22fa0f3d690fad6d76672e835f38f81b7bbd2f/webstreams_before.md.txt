 

VULNERABLE: YES/NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers/None
EXPLANATION:
Provide a more detailed explanation of your analysis here.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include recommended fixes for this code.  VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a documentation for the `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream` classes in Node.js. Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any direct implementation of the `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream` classes. The code seems to be a part of the documentation for these classes, which are likely implemented in a separate module or file. Therefore, I do not detect any vulnerabilities in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be a documentation and does not contain any implementation that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. However, it is essential to ensure that the implementation of the `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream` classes in the separate module or file does not contain any vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22930
CVE Description:
Node.js before 16.6.0, 14.
