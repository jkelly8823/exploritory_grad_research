 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use after free attack due to the experimental nature of the `process.setSourceMapsEnabled(val)` function. This function is not stable and can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to change process behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using experimental functions in production code.
2. Use a stable version of Node.js that does not contain this vulnerability.
3. If using this function, ensure that it is properly tested and validated to prevent any potential issues.
