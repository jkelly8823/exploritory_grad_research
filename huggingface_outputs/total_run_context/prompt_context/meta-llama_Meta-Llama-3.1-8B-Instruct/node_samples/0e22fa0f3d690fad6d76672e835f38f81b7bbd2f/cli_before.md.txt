 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use after free attack due to the use of the `--no-experimental-repl-await` flag. This flag is used to disable top-level await in REPL, which can lead to memory corruption and process behavior changes. The vulnerability is present in the code because it is using an outdated version of Node.js, which is not patched against this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Node.js to a version that is patched against this vulnerability, such as Node.js 16.6.0 or later.
- Remove the `--no-experimental-repl-await` flag from the code to prevent the vulnerability. 
- Consider using a more secure version of Node.js, such as Node.js 14.17.4 or later.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22930
CVE Description:
Node.js before 16.6.0, 14.17.4, and 12.22.4 is vulnerable to a use after free attack where an attacker might be able to exploit the memory corruption, to change process behavior.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
