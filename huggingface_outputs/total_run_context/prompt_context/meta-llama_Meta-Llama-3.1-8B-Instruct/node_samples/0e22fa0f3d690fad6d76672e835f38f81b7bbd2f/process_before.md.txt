 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use after free attack due to the potential for memory corruption. This is because the `process.setSourceMapsEnabled(val)` function is marked as experimental and may not be properly tested or validated, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using experimental features in production code.
2. Use a more stable version of Node.js that is not vulnerable to this issue.
3. Implement additional error handling and validation to prevent potential crashes or unexpected behavior. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22930
CVE Description:
Node.js before 16.6.0, 14.17.4, and 12.22.4 is vulnerable to a use after free attack where an attacker might be able to exploit the memory corruption, to change process behavior.  The vulnerability is due to the fact that the `process.setSourceMapsEnabled(val)` function is not properly validated, which allows an attacker to manipulate the process behavior.  This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.  The vulnerability is rated as high severity and
