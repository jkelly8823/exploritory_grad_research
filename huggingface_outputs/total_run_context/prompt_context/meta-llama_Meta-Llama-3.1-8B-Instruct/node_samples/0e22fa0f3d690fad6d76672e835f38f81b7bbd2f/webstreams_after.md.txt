 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is vulnerable to a use-after-free attack due to the lack of proper memory management in the `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream` classes. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the process behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper memory management mechanisms, such as reference counting or garbage collection, to prevent use-after-free attacks.
2.  Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it adheres to the latest security best practices and standards.
3.  Consider using a memory-safe language or framework to mitigate the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-22930
CVE Description:
Node.js before 16.6.0, 14.17.4, and 12.22.4 is vulnerable to a use after free attack where an attacker might be able to exploit the memory corruption, to change process behavior.  The vulnerability is due to a bug in the `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream` classes.  The bug allows an attacker to manipulate the process behavior by exploiting the memory corruption.  The
