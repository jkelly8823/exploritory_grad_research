 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that can be analyzed for the given vulnerability. However, the vulnerability description suggests that it is related to Node.js versions before 16.6.0, which is not directly related to the code sample provided. Nevertheless, the presence of the flag `--no-experimental-repl-await` and the mention of Node.js versions suggest that the code is likely running on a Node.js environment. Therefore, it is possible that the vulnerability could be present in the environment where this code is being executed, rather than in the code itself.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the Node.js version is up-to-date, specifically version 16.6.0 or later.
- Consider using a Node.js version manager to easily switch between different versions.
- If possible, use a secure environment or a sandboxed environment to test and run the code.
