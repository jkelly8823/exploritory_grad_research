 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the GetSubjectAltNameString function which converts SANs to a string format. This string format is subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to version 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later.
- If using an earlier version of Node.js, apply the fix for this vulnerability by escaping SANs containing the problematic characters.
- Consider using the --security-revert command-line option to revert the behavior of escaping SANs. However, this is not recommended as it may introduce security risks.  ```python
