 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44532 due to the incorrect assumption that it is safe to split the subject alternative name property at the two-character sequence `', '`. This can lead to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure method to split the subject alternative name property, such as using a regular expression that matches the correct delimiter.
- Consider using a library that provides a secure way to handle X.509 certificates and their properties. 
- If possible, upgrade to a version of Node.js that has the fix for CVE-2021-44532.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44532
CVE Description:
Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format. It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate chain, allowing the
