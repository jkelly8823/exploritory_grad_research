 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the GetInfoString function to retrieve information from the certificate, which is subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. This allows the bypass of these name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Use the --security-revert command-line option to revert the behavior of escaping SANs containing problematic characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to retrieve information from the certificate, such as using a library that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
4. Validate the input to the GetInfoString function to prevent injection attacks.
