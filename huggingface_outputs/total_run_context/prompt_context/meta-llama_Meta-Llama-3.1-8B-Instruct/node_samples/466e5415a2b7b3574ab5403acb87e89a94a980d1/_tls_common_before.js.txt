 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the StringPrototypeReplace function to replace the key in the infoAccess object. This function is vulnerable to injection attacks when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. The code does not perform any key validation, which makes it susceptible to this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44532 (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Perform key validation to ensure that only expected keys are added to the infoAccess object.
3. Consider using a more secure method to replace the key, such as using a regular expression with a positive lookahead assertion. 
4. If the --security-revert command-line option is not available, consider reverting the behavior to the previous version of Node.js.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
