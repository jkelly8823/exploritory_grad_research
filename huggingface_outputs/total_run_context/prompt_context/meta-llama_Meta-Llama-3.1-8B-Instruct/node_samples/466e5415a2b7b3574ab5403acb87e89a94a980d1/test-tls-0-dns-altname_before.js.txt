 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it is using a version of Node.js that is affected by the vulnerability. The code is using the getPeerCertificate() method to retrieve the peer certificate, which is then compared to the expected subject alternative names. However, the subject alternative names contain a null character (\0), which can be used to inject malicious data and bypass name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not affected by the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability (e.g., Node.js 12.22.9 or later, Node.js 14.18.3 or later, Node.js 16.13.2 or later, or Node.js 17.3.1 or later).
- If upgrading Node.js is not possible, use the --security-revert command-line option to revert the security fix for this vulnerability. 
- Consider using a more secure method to validate peer certificates, such as using a library that is not affected by this vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
