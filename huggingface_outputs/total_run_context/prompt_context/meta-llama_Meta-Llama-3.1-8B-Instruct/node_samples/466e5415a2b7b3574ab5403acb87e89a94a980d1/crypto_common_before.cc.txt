 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the X509V3_EXT_d2i function to parse the subject alternative name extension, which can lead to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. This is because the function does not properly escape the SANs, allowing an attacker to bypass name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not affected by the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability (i.e., 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Use the --security-revert command-line option to revert the behavior of escaping SANs containing problematic characters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to parse the subject alternative name extension, such as using a library that properly escapes the SANs.
