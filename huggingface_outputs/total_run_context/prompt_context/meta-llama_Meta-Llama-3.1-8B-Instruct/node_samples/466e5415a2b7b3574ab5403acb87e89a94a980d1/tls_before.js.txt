 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code is using the `StringPrototypeSplit` method to split the `altNames` string into an array of names, and then iterating over the array using `ArrayPrototypeForEach`. The code is also checking if the name starts with 'DNS:' or 'URI:' before adding it to the `dnsNames` array. This suggests that the code is properly handling the SANs (Subject Alternative Names) and is not vulnerable to the injection vulnerability described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix the described vulnerabilities. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date, especially for security-related issues. Make sure to check the version of Node.js being used and update it to the latest version if necessary. Additionally, consider using a linter or code analyzer to catch potential security issues in the code.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs.
