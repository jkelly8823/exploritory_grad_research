 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is not a code snippet but a documentation of an error that can occur in Node.js. However, based on the description of the vulnerability CVE-2021-44532, it appears that the code is vulnerable to the injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. This is because Node.js versions prior to 12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, and 17.3.1 convert SANs to a string format, which can be subject to injection when name constraints are used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the Node.js version is updated to 12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later. If you are using an older version, consider upgrading to a supported version. Additionally, if you are using the --security-revert command-line option, consider removing it to prevent the injection vulnerability.
