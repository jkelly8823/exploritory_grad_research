 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it is using Node.js version that is less than 12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1. This version of Node.js is susceptible to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to version 12.22.9 or higher, 14.18.3 or higher, 16.13.2 or higher, or 17.3.1 or higher.
- If you cannot upgrade Node.js, you can revert the security fix by using the --security-revert command-line option. However, this is not recommended as it may leave your system vulnerable to other security issues. 
- Consider using a secure alternative to Node.js, such as a more recent version or a different programming language.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
