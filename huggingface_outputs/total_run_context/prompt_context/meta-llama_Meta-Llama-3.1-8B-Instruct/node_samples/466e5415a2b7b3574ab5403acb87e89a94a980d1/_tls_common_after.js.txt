 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the StringPrototypeReplace function to replace certain characters in the info string. This function is used to convert SANs to a string format, which is then used to check peer certificates against hostnames when validating connections. However, this string format is subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to version 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
- If using an earlier version of Node.js, use the --security-revert command-line option to revert the security fix and prevent the injection vulnerability. 
- Validate the input to the StringPrototypeReplace function to prevent the injection vulnerability. 
- Consider using a more secure method to convert SANs to a string format, such as using a library that is designed to handle this conversion securely.  ```
