 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the `E` function to create error objects, which can be used to inject malicious data. The `E` function is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to bypass name constraints in a certificate chain.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44532 (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
- Use a secure method to create error objects, such as using the `Error` constructor directly.
- Consider using a library that provides a secure way to create error objects, such as `error-name` or `error-message`.
