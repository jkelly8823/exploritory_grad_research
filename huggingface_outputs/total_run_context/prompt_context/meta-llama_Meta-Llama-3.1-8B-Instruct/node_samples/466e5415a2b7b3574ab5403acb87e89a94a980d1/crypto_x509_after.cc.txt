 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the GetSubjectAltNameString and GetInfoAccessString functions which are susceptible to the injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. This can allow the bypass of these name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. If using an earlier version of Node.js, apply the fix for this vulnerability by escaping SANs containing problematic characters.
3. Consider using the --security-revert command-line option to revert the behavior of escaping SANs if it is not desired. 
4. Review the code and ensure that it is not using any other vulnerable functions or libraries. 
5. Consider using a more secure alternative to the GetSubjectAltNameString and GetInfoAccessString functions.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
