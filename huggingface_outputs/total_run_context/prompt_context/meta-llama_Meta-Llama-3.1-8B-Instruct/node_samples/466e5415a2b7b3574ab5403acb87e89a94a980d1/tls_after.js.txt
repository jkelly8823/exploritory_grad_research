 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability. This is because the code uses the `splitEscapedAltNames` function to parse the subject alternative names (SANs) from the certificate. This function uses a regular expression to match JSON string literals, which can be vulnerable to injection attacks when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. The code does not properly escape the SANs, allowing an attacker to bypass name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44532 (i.e., 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. If updating Node.js is not possible, use the `--security-revert` command-line option to revert the security fix for this vulnerability.
3. Consider using a more secure method to parse the SANs, such as using a library that properly escapes the SANs. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling name constraints and other certificate validation logic.
