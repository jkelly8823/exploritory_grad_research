 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44532 vulnerability because it uses the X509V3_EXT_print function to print the extension, which is subject to an injection vulnerability when name constraints are used within a certificate chain. This allows the bypass of these name constraints.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that has the fix for this vulnerability (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. If using an earlier version of Node.js, consider reverting the security fix using the --security-revert command-line option.
3. Consider using a more secure method to print the extension, such as using a secure string formatting library. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it is not using any other vulnerable functions or libraries. 5. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify any other potential vulnerabilities in the code. 6. Regularly update Node.js and other dependencies to ensure that you have the latest security patches. 7. Consider implementing a vulnerability scanning tool to regularly scan your code for potential vulnerabilities.
