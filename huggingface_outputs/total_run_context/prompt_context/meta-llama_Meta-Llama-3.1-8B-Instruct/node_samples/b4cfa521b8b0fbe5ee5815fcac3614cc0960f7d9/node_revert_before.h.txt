VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a header leak, potentially leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability is due to the implementation of HTTP/2, which is susceptible to a header leak attack. The attacker can send a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers, causing the implementation to allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies, consuming excess memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the allocation of memory for 0-length headers.
2. Consider using a more secure implementation of HTTP/2 that is not susceptible to this type of attack.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it is not vulnerable to this type of attack. 4. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure implementation of HTTP/2. 5. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent Huffman encoding of headers. 6. Regularly test the code for this type of vulnerability. 7. Consider using a static analysis tool to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code. 8. Implement a mechanism to detect
