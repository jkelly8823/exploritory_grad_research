 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a header leak, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the sending of headers with 0-length header names and values.
2. Consider using a header cache to reduce memory allocation and deallocation.
3. Regularly check for and free any unused memory allocations to prevent memory leaks. 4. Implement a mechanism to limit the maximum number of headers that can be sent in a single session. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. 6. Consider using a secure coding standard and following best practices for secure coding. 7. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the sending of Huffman encoded headers with 0-length header names and values. 8. Regularly test the code for vulnerabilities and perform code reviews to ensure the code
