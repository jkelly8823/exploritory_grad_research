 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34, 45
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9516. This is because the code does not properly handle headers with 0-length header names and values. In the StartHeaders function, the code checks if the name length is 0 and if the SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9516 flag is not set, it returns true, effectively ignoring the header. However, this does not prevent the memory allocation for the header, which can lead to a denial of service. In the ProcessHeaders function, the code does not check for 0-length header values, which can also lead to memory allocation and a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for 0-length header values in the ProcessHeaders function.
2. Properly handle headers with 0-length header names and values by not allocating memory for them.
3. Consider setting the SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9516 flag to prevent the vulnerability. However, this may have unintended consequences and should be used with caution. 4. Consider using a more robust header handling mechanism that can prevent this type of vulnerability. 5. Regularly
