 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to the presence of a space before the content-length header. This allows an attacker to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the space before the content-length header to ensure correct interpretation.
2. Implement a Content-Length header validation to prevent such smuggling attacks.
3. Consider upgrading to a more secure HTTP server implementation that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-27982
CVE Description: The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling. Specifically, if a space is placed before a content-length header, it is not interpreted correctly, enabling attackers to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first.  ```javascript
const headers = [
  'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n',
  'Content-Length:  13\r\n\r\n',
  'Hello, World!',
].join('\r\n');

const server = http.createServer(common.mustNotCall());

server.listen(0
