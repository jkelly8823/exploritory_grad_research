VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-27982
CVE Description: 
The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling. Specifically, if a space is placed before a content-length header, it is not interpreted correctly, enabling attackers to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first.  The code sample provided does not demonstrate this vulnerability. However, it is worth noting that the vulnerability is related to the handling of HTTP headers, and the code sample does not handle headers in a
