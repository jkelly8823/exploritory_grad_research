VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-27982
CVE Description: 
The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling. Specifically, if a space is placed before a content-length header, it is not interpreted correctly, enabling attackers to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first.  ```c
#define LLHTTP_VERSION_MAJOR 9
#define LLHTTP_VERSION_MINOR 2
#define LLHTTP_VERSION_PATCH 0
