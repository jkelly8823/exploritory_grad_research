 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-27982 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the Content-Length header when it is preceded by a space. This allows an attacker to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly parse the Content-Length header, regardless of whether it is preceded by a space. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to extract the Content-Length value from the header, and then checking if it is a valid number. If it is not a valid number, the code should return an error. Additionally, the code should be updated to handle the case where the Content-Length header is missing or malformed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-27982
CVE Description: The team has identified a critical vulnerability in the http server of the most recent version of Node, where malformed headers can lead to HTTP request smuggling. Specifically, if a space is placed before a content-length header, it is not interpreted correctly, enabling attackers to smuggle in a second request within the body of the first.
