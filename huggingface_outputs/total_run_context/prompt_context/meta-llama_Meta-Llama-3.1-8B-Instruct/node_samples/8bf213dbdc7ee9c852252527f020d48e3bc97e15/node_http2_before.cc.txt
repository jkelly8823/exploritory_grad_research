 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the potential for a cleanup bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer available. This is a known issue in Node.js versions 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x, which is addressed by updating the http2 implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the http2 implementation to the latest version.
2. Use a secure version of Node.js that is not vulnerable to this issue.
3. Implement additional checks to prevent the use of objects after they are no longer available. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-7161
CVE Description:
All versions of Node.js 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node server providing an http2 server to crash. This can be accomplished by interacting with the http2 server in a manner that triggers a cleanup bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer available. This has been addressed by updating the http2 implementation.
