 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The `outgoing_buffers_` and `outgoing_storage_` vectors are used to store data that is being sent over the HTTP/2 connection. However, there is no limit on the size of these vectors, which can lead to excessive memory usage and potentially cause the program to crash or become unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a limit on the size of the `outgoing_buffers_` and `outgoing_storage_` vectors to prevent excessive memory usage.
2. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a ring buffer, to store outgoing data.
3. Add a mechanism to periodically clear out the outgoing buffers to prevent memory leaks. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The `Write` function is used to write data to the session, but it does not appear to be vulnerable to the described attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
