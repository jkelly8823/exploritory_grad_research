VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker can open the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the internal data buffering, such as a queue size limit or a timeout for processing incoming data.
2. Regularly check the memory usage and CPU utilization to detect potential denial-of-service attacks.
3. Consider using a more efficient data buffering mechanism, such as a ring buffer or a memory pool.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to
