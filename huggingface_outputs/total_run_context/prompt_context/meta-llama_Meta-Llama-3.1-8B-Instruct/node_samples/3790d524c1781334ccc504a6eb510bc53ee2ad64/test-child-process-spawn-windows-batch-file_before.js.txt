 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The `cp.exec` function is used to execute a command, but the command is not properly sanitized. An attacker could inject malicious commands by manipulating the `filename` parameter. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a library that properly sanitizes the command, such as `child_process.execFileSync` or `child_process.execSync`.
2. Validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it only contains allowed characters.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to define allowed commands and parameters. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
1. Command Injection ( CWE-78 ) 
2. Unvalidated Input ( CWE-20 ) 
3. Improper Input Validation ( CWE-20 )
