 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to the presence of two copies of the header field in the HTTP request. This is because Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 allow two copies of a header field in an HTTP request, and the code does not properly handle this scenario.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 or later).
2. Implement a custom solution to handle multiple header fields in the HTTP request.
3. Use a secure HTTP parser library that is not vulnerable to this issue.
