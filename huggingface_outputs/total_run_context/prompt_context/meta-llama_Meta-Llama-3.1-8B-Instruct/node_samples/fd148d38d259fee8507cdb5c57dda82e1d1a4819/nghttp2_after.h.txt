 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of SETTINGS frames that can be sent within a certain time frame.
2. Consider using a queue with a bounded capacity to store incoming SETTINGS frames, and discard any frames that exceed the capacity.
3. Regularly check the session for misbehaving peers and close the session if necessary. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9512
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
