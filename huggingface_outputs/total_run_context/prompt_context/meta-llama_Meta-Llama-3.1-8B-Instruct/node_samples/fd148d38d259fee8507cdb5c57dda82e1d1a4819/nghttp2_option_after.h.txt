 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a set of constants and a struct definition for storing option values for nghttp2_session. There is no code that would allow for a ping flood or settings flood.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.  The code is well-structured and follows best practices. However, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of each field in the struct. This would improve code readability and make it easier for other developers to understand the code.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to add error checking to ensure that the values stored in the struct are valid. This would prevent potential issues that could arise from invalid input.  Finally, it would be beneficial to consider adding a function to validate the values stored in the struct before using them. This would provide an additional layer of protection against potential issues.  However, these are just suggestions and the code is not vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities.  The code is well-structured and follows best practices.  It would be beneficial to add comments to explain the
