 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer, which can consume excess CPU, memory, or both. The code has a variable `max_outbound_ack` which is used to detect flooding in the outbound queue, but it is not clear if this is sufficient to prevent a settings flood attack. The code also has a variable `obq_flood_counter_` which is used to detect flooding in the outbound queue, but it is not clear if this is sufficient to prevent a settings flood attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the value of `max_outbound_ack` to a higher value to prevent a settings flood attack.
2. Implement a more robust mechanism to detect and prevent settings flood attacks, such as tracking the number of SETTINGS frames received and sending an error response if a threshold is exceeded.
3. Consider implementing a mechanism to rate limit the number of SETTINGS frames that can be sent within a certain time period.
