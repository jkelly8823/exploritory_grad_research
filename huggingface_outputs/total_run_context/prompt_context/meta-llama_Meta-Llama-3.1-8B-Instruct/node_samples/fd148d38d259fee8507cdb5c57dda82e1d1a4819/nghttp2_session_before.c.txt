EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer, which can consume excess CPU, memory, or both. This is due to the line (*session_ptr)->remote_settings.max_concurrent_streams = 100;, which sets the maximum number of concurrent streams to 100. This can be exploited by sending a large number of SETTINGS frames, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit the maximum number of concurrent streams to a reasonable value, such as 10 or 20.
2. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent settings floods, such as monitoring the number of SETTINGS frames received within a certain time window.
3. Consider using a more efficient data structure to store the SETTINGS frames, such as a queue with a bounded capacity.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to a ping flood, as there is no code that builds an internal queue of responses to pings. The line if (session->obq_flood_counter_
