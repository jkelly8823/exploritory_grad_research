 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code is setting an option to disable closed streams, but it does not involve sending pings or settings frames, which are the attack vectors for the described vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the code to ensure that it is properly handling closed streams and other HTTP/2 settings. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9512
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9515
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an
