 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that could be exploited by the described vulnerabilities. The code is a simple header file that defines two macros for the version number of the nghttp2 library. There are no functions or data structures that could be used to send HTTP/2 pings or settings frames, which are the attack vectors for the described vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities.  The code is a simple header file that defines two macros for the version number of the nghttp2 library. There are no functions or data structures that could be used to send HTTP/2 pings or settings frames, which are the attack vectors for the described vulnerabilities.  However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up to date and follow the best practices for secure coding.  The code should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it does not contain any vulnerabilities.  Additionally, the code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.  The code should also be reviewed by a security expert to ensure that it is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities.  The code should also be
