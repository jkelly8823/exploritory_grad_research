 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both. This is due to the line (*session_ptr)->remote_settings.max_concurrent_streams = 100; which sets the maximum number of concurrent streams to 100, allowing an attacker to send a large number of SETTINGS frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit the maximum number of concurrent streams to a reasonable value, such as 10.
2. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent settings floods, such as tracking the number of SETTINGS frames received within a certain time window.
3. Consider implementing a mechanism to rate-limit the number of SETTINGS frames sent by the client. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9512
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue
