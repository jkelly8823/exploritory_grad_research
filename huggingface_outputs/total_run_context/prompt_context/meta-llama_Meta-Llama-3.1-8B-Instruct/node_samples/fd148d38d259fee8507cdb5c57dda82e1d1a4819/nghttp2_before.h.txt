 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any HTTP/2 implementation or related functions. It appears to be a part of a larger library or framework, but it does not exhibit any of the vulnerabilities described in the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code, so no fixes are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that it is properly handling HTTP/2 requests and responses to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to further protect against potential attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9512
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
