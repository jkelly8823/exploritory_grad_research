 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the nghttp2 library accepting too many settings entries in a single SETTINGS frame. The code has a function nghttp2_option_set_max_settings that allows the user to set the maximum number of settings entries per SETTINGS frame. However, the default value of this function is 32, which is less than the 2400 individual settings entries used in the proof of concept attack. This means that the code is vulnerable to the attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the nghttp2 library to version 1.41.0 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback to drop the connection if a large SETTINGS frame is received.
3. Increase the default value of nghttp2_option_set_max_settings to a value greater than 2400 to prevent the attack. However, this may not be the best solution as it may not prevent other types of attacks.
