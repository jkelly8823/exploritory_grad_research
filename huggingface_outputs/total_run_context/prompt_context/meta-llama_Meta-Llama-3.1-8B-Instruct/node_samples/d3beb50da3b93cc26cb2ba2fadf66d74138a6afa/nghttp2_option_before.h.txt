 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could be used to exploit the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the SETTINGS frame payload size, which is not present in the given code. The code only defines some constants and a struct to store option values for nghttp2_session.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code that needs to be fixed. However, it is recommended to ensure that the nghttp2 library is updated to version 1.41.0 or later to prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, implementing the workaround mentioned in the CVE description is also recommended.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-11080
CVE Description:
In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability.
