 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be exploited by the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the SETTINGS frame payload size, which is not present in the given code. The code only handles error cases related to HTTP/2 sessions, such as flooding and too many settings entries, but it does not process or handle SETTINGS frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly handling and validating HTTP/2 frames to prevent other potential vulnerabilities.  ```python
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.14.1 do not protect from a payload being injected into messages that are logged. This makes it possible to inject malicious expressions that are executed. This flaw could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the running application.

Code Sample:
import logging
from logging.handlers import MemoryHandler

class CustomHandler(MemoryHandler):
    def __init
