 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not contain any code that could be used to exploit the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. The code defines constants and a struct to store option values for nghttp2_session, but it does not contain any code that could be used to process or handle large SETTINGS frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that could be used to exploit the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is still recommended to follow the workaround described in the CVE description to prevent potential issues. This can be done by implementing the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback and dropping the connection if a large SETTINGS frame is received.  VULNERABILITY LIST:

In the Linux kernel before 4.17.2, a use-after-free vulnerability was introduced when the netfilter NF_INET_LOCAL_IN hook is used. This is due to the fact that the nf_hook_thresh variable is not properly checked before it is used. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service.
