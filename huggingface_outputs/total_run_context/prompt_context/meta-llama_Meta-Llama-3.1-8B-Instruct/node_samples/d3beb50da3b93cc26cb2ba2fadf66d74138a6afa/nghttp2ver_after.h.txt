 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a header file that defines version numbers for the nghttp2 library. It does not contain any code that could be exploited to cause a denial of service due to an overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload. The version numbers are defined as macros and do not have any dynamic or user-input-dependent behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2020-11080. However, it is recommended to keep the library version up-to-date to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are patched.  The library version is already set to 1.41.0, which is the fixed version for this vulnerability.  Therefore, no further action is required.  The nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback workaround is not applicable in this case.  The code does not contain any code that would receive an HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame.  Therefore, the workaround is not necessary.  The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2020-11080.  Therefore, no further action is required.  The library version is already set to 1.41
