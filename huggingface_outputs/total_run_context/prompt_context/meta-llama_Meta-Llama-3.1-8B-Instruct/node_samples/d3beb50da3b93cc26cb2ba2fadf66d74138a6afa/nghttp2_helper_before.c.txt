VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.14.1 do not protect from a payload being injected into messages that are logged. This makes it possible to inject malicious expressions that are executed. This flaw could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the running application.

Code Sample:
import logging
from logging.handlers import MemoryHandler

def log_message(message):
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    handler = MemoryHandler(1000)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    logger.info(message)
