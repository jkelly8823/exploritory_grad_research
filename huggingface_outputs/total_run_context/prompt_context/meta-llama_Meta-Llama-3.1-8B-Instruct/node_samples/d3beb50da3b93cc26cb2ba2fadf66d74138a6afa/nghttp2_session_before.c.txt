 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. The code does not contain any settings frame payload that is overly large, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The code does handle settings frame payloads and updates the connection-level flow control window accordingly, but it does not allow for an overly large payload to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that it is handling settings frame payloads correctly and updating the connection-level flow control window accordingly. Additionally, it is recommended to consider implementing the workaround for this vulnerability, which involves implementing the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback to drop the connection if a large settings frame payload is received.  This is not necessary in this case, as the code is not vulnerable.  However, it is a good practice to consider implementing this workaround to prevent potential issues in the future.  It is also recommended to review the code and ensure that it is handling other potential vulnerabilities and issues correctly.  This includes reviewing the code for other potential
