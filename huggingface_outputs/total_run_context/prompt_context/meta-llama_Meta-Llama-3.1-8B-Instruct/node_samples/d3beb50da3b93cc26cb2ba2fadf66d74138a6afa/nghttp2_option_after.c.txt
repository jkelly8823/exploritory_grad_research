 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any code that could be used to exploit the CVE-2020-11080 vulnerability. The code only contains function calls to set options for an nghttp2 object, and does not contain any code that could be used to create an overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be fixed. However, it is recommended to ensure that the nghttp2 library is up-to-date to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  The nghttp2 library should be updated to version 1.41.0 or later to prevent this vulnerability.  Additionally, the nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback should be implemented to drop the connection if a large SETTINGS frame is received.  This will prevent the CPU from spiking at 100% in the event of a malicious client constructing a large SETTINGS frame.  However, this is a workaround and not a fix for the vulnerability.  The best course of action is to update the nghttp2 library to a version that has been patched for this vulnerability.  The nghttp2 library should be updated to version 1.
