 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to OS Command Injection due to the insufficient IsAllowedHost check in the IsIPAddress function. The function does not properly validate the IP address, allowing an attacker to bypass the check and inject malicious commands. This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to rebinding attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to version 14.20.0 or higher, 16.20.0 or higher, or 18.5.0 or higher to patch the vulnerability.
2. Implement a more robust IP address validation mechanism, such as using a regular expression or a dedicated IP address validation library.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to validate allowed hosts, rather than relying on a blacklist approach. This can help prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32212
CVE Description:
A OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions <14.20.0, <16.20.0, <18.5.0 due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check that can easily be bypassed because IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP
