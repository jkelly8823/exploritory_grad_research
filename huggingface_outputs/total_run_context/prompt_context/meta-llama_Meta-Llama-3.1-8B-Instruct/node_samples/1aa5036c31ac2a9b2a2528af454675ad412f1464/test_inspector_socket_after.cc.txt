VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a series of unit tests designed to check the behavior of the InspectorSocket class when handling invalid host IP addresses. The tests cover various scenarios, including IP addresses with invalid characters, out-of-range octets, empty octets, and incorrect octet counts. However, the code does not contain any direct implementation of the InspectorSocket class or its host IP validation logic. The tests are written in C++ and utilize the Google Test framework. The code appears to be a part of a larger project, and the InspectorSocket class is likely implemented elsewhere in the codebase. The tests are designed to ensure that the InspectorSocket class correctly handles invalid host IP addresses and fails the handshake in such cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the implementation of the InspectorSocket class to ensure that it correctly validates host IP addresses and handles invalid inputs.
2. Consider adding additional tests to cover more scenarios, such as IP addresses with leading zeros or non-numeric characters.
3. Ensure that the InspectorSocket class is properly documented to explain its host IP validation logic and behavior. 4. Consider using a more robust IP address validation library to handle complex cases. 5.
