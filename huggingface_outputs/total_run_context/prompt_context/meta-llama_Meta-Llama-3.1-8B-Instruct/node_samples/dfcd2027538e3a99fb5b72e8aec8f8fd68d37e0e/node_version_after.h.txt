 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code appears to be a set of preprocessor directives and macros for defining version numbers and stringifying values. There is no code that would be susceptible to the X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that would be exploitable by the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep your code up to date with the latest security patches and to follow secure coding practices. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-1793
CVE Description:
The X509_verify_cert function in crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1n, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1p, and 1.0.2b does not properly process X.509 Basic Constraints cA values during identification of alternative certificate chains, which allows remote attackers to spoof a Certification Authority role and trigger unintended certificate verifications via a valid leaf certificate.

Code Sample:
#include <openssl/ssl.h
