VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability because it does not properly handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names. The `parseCertString` function is used to parse the issuer and subject strings, but it does not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. This allows an attacker to craft a certificate subject that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, potentially allowing them to inject a Common Name that would bypass certificate subject verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability (i.e., 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Use a library that properly handles multi-value Relative Distinguished Names, such as `asn1.js`.
3. Remove the `parseCertString` function and instead use a library that properly handles multi-value Relative Distinguished Names. 
4. If possible, remove the `translatePeerCertificate` function and instead use a library that properly handles multi-value
