 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability because it does not properly handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names. The line `c.subject = parseCertString(c.subject);` is the vulnerable line as it does not check if the subject is a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name before parsing it. This could allow an attacker to inject a Common Name that would bypass the certificate subject verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
- Add a check to ensure that the subject is a single-value Relative Distinguished Name before parsing it. This can be done by checking the type of the subject before calling `parseCertString()`. 
- Consider using a more secure library or function to handle certificate parsing and verification.
