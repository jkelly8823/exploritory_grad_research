 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code snippet is using the X509Certificate class and the X509ToObject function to handle certificate subjects, but it does not seem to be using multi-value Relative Distinguished Names or attempting to bypass certificate subject verification. The code is also using the ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP macro, which suggests that it is handling potential errors and exceptions properly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep Node.js up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, consider using a secure coding practice such as code reviews and testing to ensure the security of the code.  ```
