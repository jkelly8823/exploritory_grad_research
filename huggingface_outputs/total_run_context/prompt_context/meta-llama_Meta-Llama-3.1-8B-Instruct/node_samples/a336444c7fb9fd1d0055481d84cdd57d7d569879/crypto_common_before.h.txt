 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code is using the `X509ToObject` function to convert an X509 certificate to a V8 object, but it does not seem to be handling multi-value Relative Distinguished Names. However, the `GetValidTo` function is not using the `X509ToObject` function, and it is not clear how the `GetValidTo` function is being used in the context of the described vulnerability. Without more information about the code's usage and the specific version of Node.js being used, it is difficult to determine if the code is vulnerable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify the version of Node.js being used and ensure it is up-to-date.
2. Review the code's usage of the `GetValidTo` function and ensure it is not vulnerable to the described issue.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling X509 certificates, such as using a dedicated library or module.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
