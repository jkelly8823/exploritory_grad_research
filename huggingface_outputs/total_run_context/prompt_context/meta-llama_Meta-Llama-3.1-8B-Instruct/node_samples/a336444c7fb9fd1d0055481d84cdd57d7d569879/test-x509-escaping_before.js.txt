 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability because it is using an older version of Node.js that does not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. This allows attackers to craft certificate subjects that can bypass the certificate subject verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as Node.js 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later. Additionally, ensure that any third-party code used is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44533
