 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability. The code is using the `GetSubject`, `GetIssuerString`, and `GetSubjectAltNameString` functions to extract information from the certificate, but it does not appear to be using the `node` library's ambiguous presentation of certificate subjects. Additionally, the code is using a `BIOPointer` to create a memory BIO, which is a secure way to handle certificate data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date and to use the latest version of Node.js to ensure you have the latest security patches.
