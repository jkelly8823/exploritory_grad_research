VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability because it does not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Specifically, in the GetX509NameObject function, the code intentionally ignores the value of X509_NAME_ENTRY_set because it assumes that multi-value RDNs are rare. However, this assumption can be exploited by attackers to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability (i.e., 12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Modify the GetX509NameObject function to correctly handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names. This can be done by properly parsing and representing multi-value RDNs in the resulting object.
3. Consider using a more robust and secure library for handling X.509 certificates and Relative Distinguished Names. 
4. Review and update the code to ensure that it correctly handles all possible scenarios and edge cases related to Relative D
