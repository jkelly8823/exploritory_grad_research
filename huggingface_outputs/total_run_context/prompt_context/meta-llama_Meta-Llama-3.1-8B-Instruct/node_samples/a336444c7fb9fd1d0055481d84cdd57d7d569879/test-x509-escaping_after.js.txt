 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code is testing the escaping rules for the subject field in X509 certificates and does not contain any code that would be affected by the CVEs. The code is also using a self-signed certificate, which is not affected by the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described CVEs. However, it is recommended to keep the Node.js version up to date to ensure that any future vulnerabilities are patched. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure and trusted certificate authority to generate certificates. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44533
CVE Description:
Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.Aff
