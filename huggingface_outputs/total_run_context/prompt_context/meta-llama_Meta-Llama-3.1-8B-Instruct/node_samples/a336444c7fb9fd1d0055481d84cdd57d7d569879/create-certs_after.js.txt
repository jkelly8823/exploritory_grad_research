 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability because it does not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. In the `subjects` array, there are multiple instances where a single-value Relative Distinguished Name is interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, which can allow an attacker to inject a Common Name that would bypass certificate subject verification.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by the CVE-2021-44533 vulnerability (i.e., 12.22.9 or later, 14.18.3 or later, 16.13.2 or later, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Modify the code to correctly handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names. This can be done by checking the type of each Relative Distinguished Name and ensuring that it is not interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name when it is a single-value Relative Distinguished Name. 
3. Use a library that correctly handles multi-value Relative Distinguished Names, such as the `asn1` library. 
4. Validate the input data to prevent attackers from
