 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. The code snippet is using the X509Certificate class and the X509ToObject function to convert the certificate to a JavaScript object. However, the code does not seem to be using multi-value Relative Distinguished Names, which is the specific vulnerability being addressed. The code is also not using any Node.js versions that are known to be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address this vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to keep Node.js and its dependencies up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches. Additionally, consider using a secure coding practice such as input validation and sanitization to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  ```python
```python
def get_issuer_cert(cert):
    # Assuming cert is a X509Certificate object
    issuer_cert = cert.get_issuer_cert()
    return issuer_cert

# Example usage:
cert = X509Certificate()  # Assuming X509Certificate is a class
issuer_cert = get_issuer_cert(cert)
print(issuer_cert)
```
