 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a reset flood due to the potential for the pending_rst_streams_ vector to consume excess memory. This is because the vector is used to store the IDs of streams that have been reset, and if the attacker sends a large number of invalid requests, the vector could grow indefinitely, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of the pending_rst_streams_ vector, such as using a fixed-size array or a data structure that automatically discards old entries.
2. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a set or a map, to store the IDs of reset streams, which would allow for faster lookups and potentially reduce memory usage.
3. Add a check to ensure that the vector is not growing indefinitely, and if it is, terminate the connection or take other appropriate action to prevent a denial of service.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9514
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an
