VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker can open a number of streams and send an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both. The code checks for the number of rejected streams and if it exceeds 100, it returns an error. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the reset flood attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust check to prevent the reset flood attack, such as limiting the number of concurrent streams or implementing a rate limiting mechanism.
2. Consider using a more secure way to handle the RST_STREAM frames, such as using a queue with a bounded capacity to prevent excessive memory consumption.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date with the latest security patches.  ```rust
