 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-9514 reset flood vulnerability. The code checks if the session can add a new stream and if the stream is not destroyed before attempting to start headers. This prevents an attacker from opening an excessive number of streams and sending invalid requests to solicit RST_STREAM frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this specific vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it is secure against other potential vulnerabilities.  ``` VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9514
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

Code Sample:
#include "node_http2.h"
#include "node_http2_state.h"
#include "node_perf.h"
#include "util-inl.h
