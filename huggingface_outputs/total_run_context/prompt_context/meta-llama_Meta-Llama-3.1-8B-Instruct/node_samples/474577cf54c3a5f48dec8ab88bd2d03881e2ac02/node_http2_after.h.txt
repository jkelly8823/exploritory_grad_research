 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2019-9514. However, it does contain a counter for rejected streams, which could potentially be used to track and prevent a reset flood attack. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to a reset flood attack, but it does have a mechanism in place to detect and prevent such an attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the CVE-2019-9514 vulnerability. However, it may be beneficial to add additional logging or monitoring to track rejected streams and detect potential attacks. This could involve adding a threshold for the rejected stream count and logging or alerting when this threshold is exceeded.
