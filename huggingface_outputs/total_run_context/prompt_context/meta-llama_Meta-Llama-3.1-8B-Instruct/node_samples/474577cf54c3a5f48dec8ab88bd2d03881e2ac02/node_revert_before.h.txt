 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the HTTP/2 protocol or any other protocol that could be vulnerable to a reset flood. The code is a C++ code snippet that defines a namespace and an enum, and does not contain any code that could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2019-9514. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9514
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both. 

Code Sample:
/**
 * @fileoverview This file contains the implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol.
 * @author [Author Name]
 */

// Import the necessary modules
import { Http2Server } from './http2_server';
import { Http2Stream }
