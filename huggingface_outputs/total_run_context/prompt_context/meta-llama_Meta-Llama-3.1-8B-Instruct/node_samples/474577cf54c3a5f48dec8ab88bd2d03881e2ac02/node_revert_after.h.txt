 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-9514 because it uses the SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro which is used to define the reversion enum. This macro is used to define the CVE-2019-9514 vulnerability, which is a known vulnerability in HTTP/2 implementations. The code does not appear to have any mitigations or fixes in place to prevent this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro and the related code that defines the reversion enum.
2. Update the code to use a secure version of the HTTP/2 implementation that is not vulnerable to CVE-2019-9514.
3. Consider adding additional security measures to prevent reset floods, such as rate limiting or stream queuing.  ```
