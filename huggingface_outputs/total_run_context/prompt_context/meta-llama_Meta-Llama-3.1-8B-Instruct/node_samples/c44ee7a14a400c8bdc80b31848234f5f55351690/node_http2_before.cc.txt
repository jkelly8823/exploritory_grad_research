 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to resource loops or denial of service attacks. However, it does contain several potential issues such as memory leaks, incorrect error handling, and potential buffer overflows. The code also appears to be using a mix of C++ and JavaScript, which can make it harder to analyze and debug.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code for potential memory leaks and implement a memory management strategy to prevent them.
2. Improve error handling to ensure that all possible error scenarios are handled correctly.
3. Use a secure method to handle buffer copying to prevent potential buffer overflows.
4. Consider using a more modern C++ version and a JavaScript engine that is more secure and up-to-date.
5. Use a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities and fix them before deploying the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9513
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree.
