 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to resource loops due to the potential for excessive CPU consumption caused by continually shuffling the priority of streams. This is a known issue in some HTTP/2 implementations, as described in CVE-2019-9513.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of request streams and prevent excessive priority shuffling.
2. Consider using a more robust priority tree implementation that is resistant to resource loops.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is not vulnerable to known issues like CVE-2019-9513.  ```python
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for excessive CPU consumption caused by continually shuffling the priority of streams. This is a known issue in some HTTP/2 implementations, as described in CVE-2019-9513.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of request streams and prevent excessive priority shuffling.
2. Consider using a more robust priority tree implementation that is resistant to resource loops
