 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE-2019-9513. The code does not contain any obvious resource loops or priority tree manipulation that could lead to a denial of service. The nghttp2_session handle is used to manage HTTP/2 connections, but there is no indication that the code is vulnerable to the described attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it is free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure coding framework or library to help identify potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9513
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU.  Code Sample: 
void Http2Session::OnStreamPriorityChanged(Stream* stream, uint32_t priority) {
  // Update the priority of the stream in
