 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to HTTP/2 or any other protocol that could be vulnerable to resource loops. The code is a series of variable declarations using the V() macro, which suggests it is a configuration or initialization code for a system or application. There is no indication of any network communication or resource management that could be affected by the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce any other vulnerabilities.  ```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    return width * height

def calculate_perimeter(width, height):
    return 2 * (width + height)

def main():
    width = 10
    height = 20
    area = calculate_area(width, height)
    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(width, height)
    print(f"Area: {area}, Perimeter: {perimeter}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
