 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent resource loops.
2. Limit the number of concurrent request streams.
3. Regularly clean up and close idle streams to prevent resource accumulation. 
4. Implement a timeout mechanism to prevent the session from being stuck in an infinite loop. 
5. Monitor the system for excessive CPU usage and take corrective action if necessary. 6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. 7. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against resource loops. 8. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the creation of multiple request streams with the same priority. 9. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. 10. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against resource loops. 11. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the
