 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-23919 due to the usage of Node.js versions that are affected by this vulnerability. The code uses the crypto module to generate a key pair and verify the certificate, which may lead to false positive errors during subsequent cryptographic operations. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to version 19.2.0 or later, 18.14.1 or later, 16.19.1 or later, or 14.21.3 or later to fix this vulnerability.
- Avoid using the crypto module for cryptographic operations that are sensitive to false positive errors. 
- Consider using a different cryptographic library that is not affected by this vulnerability.  ```javascript
