 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code does not use Node.js and the described vulnerability is specific to Node.js. The code is written in C++ and appears to be using the OpenSSL library for cryptographic operations. The described vulnerability is related to the error handling in Node.js, which is not applicable to this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the OpenSSL library is being used correctly. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the OpenSSL library up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-23919
CVE Description:
A cryptographic vulnerability exists in Node.js <19.2.0, <18.14.1, <16.19.1, <14.21.3 that in some cases did does not clear the OpenSSL error stack after operations that may set it. This may lead to false positive errors during subsequent cryptographic operations that happen to be on the same thread. This in
