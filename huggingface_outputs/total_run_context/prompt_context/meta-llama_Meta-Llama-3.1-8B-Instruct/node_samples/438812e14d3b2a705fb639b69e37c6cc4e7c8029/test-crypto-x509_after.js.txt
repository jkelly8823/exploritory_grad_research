 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cryptographic vulnerability (CVE-2023-23919) due to the use of Node.js versions that do not clear the OpenSSL error stack after operations. This may lead to false positive errors during subsequent cryptographic operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to version 19.2.0 or later, 18.14.1 or later, 16.19.1 or later, or 14.21.3 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Consider using a secure cryptographic library that is not affected by this vulnerability. 
3. If upgrading Node.js is not feasible, consider using a workaround such as clearing the OpenSSL error stack manually after each operation. However, this is not recommended as it may introduce additional complexity and potential issues. 
4. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is properly secured.  ```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const key = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('ed25519').privateKey;
const certPem = `
