 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30587 vulnerability. This is because the code is running with the `--experimental-permission` flag, which is affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass restrictions set by this flag, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the file system, spawning processes, or enabling the runtime inspector.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability.
2. Avoid using the `--experimental-permission` flag until the issue is resolved.
3. Consider using a different permission model or mechanism to restrict access to sensitive resources.

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30587
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in Node.js version 20 allows for bypassing restrictions set by the --experimental-permission flag using the built-in inspector module (node:inspector).

By exploiting the Worker class's ability to create an "internal worker" with the kIsInternal Symbol, attackers can modify the isInternal value when an inspector is attached within the Worker constructor before initializing a new WorkerImpl. This vulnerability exclusively affects Node.js users
