 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30587 due to the presence of the permission model mechanism, which is an experimental feature in Node.js. The code attempts to restrict the process from spawning/worker or using addons unless explicitly allowed by the user. However, the permission model can be bypassed by exploiting the Worker class's ability to create an internal worker with the kIsInternal Symbol. This allows attackers to modify the isInternal value when an inspector is attached within the Worker constructor before initializing a new WorkerImpl.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version that has patched this vulnerability.
2. Disable the permission model mechanism by removing the experimental_permission flag.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30587
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in Node.js version 20 allows for bypassing restrictions set by the --experimental-permission flag using the built-in inspector module (node:inspector). 

By exploiting the Worker class's ability to create an "internal worker" with the kIsInternal Symbol, attackers can modify
