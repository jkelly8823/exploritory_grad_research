 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to CVE-2018-7162. The vulnerability is related to the TLS implementation in Node.js versions 9.x and 10.x, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be handling errors and inserting data into a pending cleartext input buffer, but it does not involve any TLS-related functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-7162. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for other potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-7162
CVE Description:
All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash. This can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages during the handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS implementation.

Code Sample:
  if (i!= count) {
    int err;
