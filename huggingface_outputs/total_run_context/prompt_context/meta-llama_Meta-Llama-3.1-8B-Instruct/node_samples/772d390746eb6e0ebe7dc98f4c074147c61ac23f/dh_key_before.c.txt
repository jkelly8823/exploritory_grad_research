 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-0732 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a DH(E) based ciphersuite for key agreement in a TLS handshake. The code is generating a new key using the BN_MONT_CTX and BIGNUM functions, which can be exploited by a malicious server to send a very large prime value to the client, causing the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev or later.
2. Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev or later.
3. Implement a timeout mechanism to prevent the client from hanging indefinitely.
4. Use a secure random number generator to generate the key.

CVE_ID:CVE-2018-0732
CVE Description:
During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time
