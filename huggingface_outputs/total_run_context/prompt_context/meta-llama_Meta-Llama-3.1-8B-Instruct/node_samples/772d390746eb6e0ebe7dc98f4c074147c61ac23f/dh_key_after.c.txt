 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-0732 vulnerability because it does not check if the modulus (dh->p) is too large. Although it checks if the number of bits in the modulus is greater than OPENSSL_DH_MAX_MODULUS_BITS, this is not sufficient to prevent a large prime value from causing a Denial Of Service attack. A malicious server can still send a very large prime value to the client, causing the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the modulus is too large by comparing it to a maximum allowed value, not just the number of bits.
2. Use a secure random number generator to generate the key.
3. Implement a timeout mechanism to prevent the client from hanging indefinitely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-0732
CVE Description:
During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key
