 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-22939 vulnerability because it passes "undefined" as the value for the "rejectUnauthorized" parameter in the tls.connect() function. This allows connections to servers with an expired certificate to be accepted without returning an error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the "rejectUnauthorized" parameter is set to a boolean value (true or false) in the tls.connect() function.
- Consider implementing a certificate validation mechanism to ensure that the server's certificate is valid before establishing a connection.
