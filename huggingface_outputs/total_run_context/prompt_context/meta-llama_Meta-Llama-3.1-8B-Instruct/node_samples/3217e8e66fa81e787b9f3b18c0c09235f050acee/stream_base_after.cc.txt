 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for an attacker to send tiny chunks of data in short succession, causing the memory consumed by the net.Socket object to increase. This is a result of a bug introduced in Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later, which was restored by reverting to the prior behavior. The code is using the net.Socket object directly as a stream, which is the cause of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version prior to 9.7.0 to avoid this vulnerability.
2. Use a different method to read from the network, such as using a library that is not affected by this bug.
3. Implement a mechanism to limit the amount of memory consumed by the net.Socket object, such as by using a buffer or a queue to handle incoming data.  VULNERABLE: YES
