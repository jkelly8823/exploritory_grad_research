 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for an attacker to send tiny chunks of data in short succession, causing the memory consumed by the net.Socket object to increase. This is a result of a bug introduced in Node.js versions 9.7.0 and later, which was restored by reverting to the prior behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to a version prior to 9.7.0 to prevent this vulnerability.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the amount of memory consumed by the net.Socket object, such as by setting a maximum buffer size.
3. Consider using a more robust networking library that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```bash
```bash
