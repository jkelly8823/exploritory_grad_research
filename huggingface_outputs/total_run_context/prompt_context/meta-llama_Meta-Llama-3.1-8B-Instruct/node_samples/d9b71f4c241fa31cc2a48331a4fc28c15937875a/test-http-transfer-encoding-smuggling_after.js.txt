 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the lack of strict CRLF sequence usage in the llhttp parser. This is consistent with the description of CVE-2022-32214.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade the llhttp parser to a version that is not vulnerable to HRS, such as v14.20.1 or later.
- Ensure that the CRLF sequence is strictly used to delimit HTTP requests. This can be achieved by using a parser that enforces this rule, such as the `http-parser` library. 
- Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent HRS, such as using a Content-Length header or a chunked encoding mechanism. 
- Regularly update Node.js to the latest version to ensure that all known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```
