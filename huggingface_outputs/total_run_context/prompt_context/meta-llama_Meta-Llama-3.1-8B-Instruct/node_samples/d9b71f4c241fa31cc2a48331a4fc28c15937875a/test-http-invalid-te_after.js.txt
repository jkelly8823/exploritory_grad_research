 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the incorrect handling of multi-line Transfer-Encoding headers. The llhttp parser in Node.js versions <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1, and <v18.9.1 does not correctly handle multi-line Transfer-Encoding headers, which can lead to HRS. The code sample contains a multi-line Transfer-Encoding header, which can be exploited to smuggle HTTP requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to a version greater than or equal to v14.20.1, v16.17.1, or v18.9.1 to fix the vulnerability.
- Ensure that the Transfer-Encoding header is correctly handled and does not allow multi-line values.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent HTTP Request Smuggling attacks.  ```python
import requests

def exploit_hrs(url):
    headers = {
        'Host': 'hacker.exploit.com',
        'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        'Content-Length': '10',
        'Transfer-Encoding': 'eee, chunked'
    }
