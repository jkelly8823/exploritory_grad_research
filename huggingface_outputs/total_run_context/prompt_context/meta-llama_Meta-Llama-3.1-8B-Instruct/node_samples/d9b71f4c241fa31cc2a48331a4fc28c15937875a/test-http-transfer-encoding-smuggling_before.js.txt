 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the lack of strict CRLF sequence usage in the llhttp parser. This is consistent with the description of CVE-2022-32214.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the llhttp parser to a version that is not vulnerable, such as v14.20.1 or later.
2. Use a more secure HTTP parser that strictly enforces the CRLF sequence. 
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent HRS, such as using a Content-Length header or a more secure request parsing mechanism.
