 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the presence of a multi-line Transfer-Encoding header. The header contains the value "chunked, eee" which is not a valid Transfer-Encoding value. This can lead to the parser incorrectly handling the request, allowing an attacker to smuggle HTTP requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the Node.js version to a version that is not vulnerable (v14.20.1 or later, v16.17.1 or later, v18.9.1 or later).
- Ensure that the Transfer-Encoding header is properly validated and sanitized to prevent multi-line values.
- Consider using a more secure HTTP parser that is not vulnerable to HRS.
