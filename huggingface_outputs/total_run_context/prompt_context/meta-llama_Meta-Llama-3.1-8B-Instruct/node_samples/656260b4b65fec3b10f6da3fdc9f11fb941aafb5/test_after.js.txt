 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any calls to napi_get_value_string_*() functions, which are the primary functions affected by the CVE-2020-8174 vulnerability. The test_string.TestLargeUtf16() function is not a call to napi_get_value_string_*() and the test_string.TestMemoryCorruption() function is not a call to napi_get_value_string_*() either. The code sample is using the repeat() method to create a large string, but it is not using the napi_get_value_string_*() functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any calls to napi_get_value_string_*() functions, so there are no recommendations for fixes. However, it is worth noting that the test_string.TestMemoryCorruption() function is creating a large string and passing it to the test_string.TestMemoryCorruption() function, which could potentially cause a memory corruption issue if the function is not designed to handle large strings. It would be a good idea to add some error checking to ensure that the function can handle large strings.  The test_string.TestLargeUtf16() function is not a call to napi_get
