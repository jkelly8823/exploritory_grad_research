 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the use of napi_get_value_string_*() functions in node versions less than 10.21.0, 12.18.0, and 14.4.0. The functions allow various kinds of memory corruption. The code is using these functions in lines 5, 11, and 17, which are within the vulnerable versions of node. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the node version to 10.21.0, 12.18.0, or 14.4.0 or later.
2. Use a secure alternative to napi_get_value_string_*() functions, such as napi_get_value_string_utf8() or napi_get_value_string_utf16(). 
3. Use a memory-safe function to write data to the buffer, such as napi_create_string_utf8() or napi_create_string_utf16(). 
4. Validate the input data to prevent buffer overflow attacks. 
5. Consider using a memory-safe library or framework that handles string operations securely.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
