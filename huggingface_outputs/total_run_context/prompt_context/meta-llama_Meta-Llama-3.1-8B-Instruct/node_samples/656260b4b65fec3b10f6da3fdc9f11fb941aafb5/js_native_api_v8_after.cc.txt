 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the use of napi_get_value_string_*() functions in node versions < 10.21.0, 12.18.0, and < 14.4.0. The code is using these functions to write data to a buffer, but it does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the node version to 10.21.0, 12.18.0, or 14.4.0 or later.
2. Use a safer function to write data to the buffer, such as napi_create_string_utf8() or napi_create_string_utf16().
3. Add a check to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the data before writing to it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-8174
CVE Description:
napi_get_value_string_*() allows various kinds of memory corruption in node < 10.21.0,
