 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any calls to napi_get_value_string_*() and does not appear to be vulnerable to the described memory corruption issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is worth noting that the test is expecting an error to be thrown, but the error message is hardcoded. It may be more robust to use a more dynamic error message or to verify that the error message matches the expected pattern.  The test could be improved by using a more robust error message or by verifying that the error message matches the expected pattern.  This would make the test more resilient to changes in the code or the error message.  This could be achieved by using a regular expression that matches the expected error message, or by verifying that the error message contains the expected string.  This would make the test more robust and less prone to false negatives.  This could be achieved by using a library like assert.throws() with a custom error message, or by using a testing library that supports custom error messages.  This would make the test more robust and less prone to false negatives.  This could be achieved by
