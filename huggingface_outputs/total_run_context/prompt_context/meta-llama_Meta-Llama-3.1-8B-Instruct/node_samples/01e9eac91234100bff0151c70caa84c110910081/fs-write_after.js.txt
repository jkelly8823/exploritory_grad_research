 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-36137 vulnerability because it uses the fs.fchown and fs.fchmod functions with a read-only file descriptor. This allows an attacker to change the owner and permissions of a file, even if the file is not writable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using fs.fchown and fs.fchmod with read-only file descriptors.
2. Use fs.chown and fs.chmod instead, which do not require a writable file descriptor.
3. If you must use fs.fchown and fs.fchmod, ensure that the file descriptor is writable before making changes. This can be done by checking the file descriptor's flags using fs.fstatSync(fd).isWritable(). 

Note: The code sample provided is a test case for the vulnerability, and the vulnerability is present in the code that is being tested. The code is not vulnerable in the sense that it is being exploited, but rather that it contains the vulnerability.  The vulnerability is present in the lines where fs.fchown and fs.fchmod are used with a read-only file descriptor.  The lines are 7-9.
