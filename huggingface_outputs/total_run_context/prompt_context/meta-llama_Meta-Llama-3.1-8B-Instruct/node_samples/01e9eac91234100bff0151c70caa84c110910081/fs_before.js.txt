 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-36137 vulnerability because it uses the `fs.fchmod` and `fs.fchown` functions, which can use a "read-only" file descriptor to change the owner and permissions of a file. This is a problem because the Node.js Permission Model does not operate on file descriptors, and using these functions can bypass the permission checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using `fs.fchmod` and `fs.fchown` functions when the `--allow-fs-write` flag is used.
2. Use the `fs.chmod` and `fs.chown` functions instead, which do not use file descriptors and are safer.
3. Consider using a more secure permission model, such as the one provided by the `fs.promises` API.
