VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-36137 because it does not properly handle the case where the permission model is enabled and the --allow-fs-write flag is used. The code checks if the permission model is enabled, but it does not check if the --allow-fs-write flag is set. This allows an attacker to bypass the permission model and write to files even when the permission model is enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the --allow-fs-write flag before enabling the permission model.
2. Use the fs.fchown and fs.fchmod functions with the --allow-fs-write flag set to ensure that the permission model is properly enforced.
3. Consider using a more secure permission model that does not rely on the --allow-fs-write flag.
