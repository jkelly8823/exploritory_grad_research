 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2022-32222 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to a default path for openssl.cnf in Node.js on Linux, which is not relevant to the provided code sample. The code sample appears to be a configuration snippet for a build process, and it does not involve any cryptographic functions or OpenSSL configuration.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2022-32222 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that any cryptographic functions or OpenSSL configuration are properly secured and up-to-date in the actual codebase. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32222
CVE Description:
A cryptographic vulnerability exists on Node.js on linux in versions of 18.x prior to 18.40.0 which allowed a default path for openssl.cnf that might be accessible under some circumstances to a non-admin user instead of /etc/ssl as was the case in versions prior to the upgrade to OpenSSL 3.  This vulnerability is not present in the code sample provided.  The code sample does not contain any code
