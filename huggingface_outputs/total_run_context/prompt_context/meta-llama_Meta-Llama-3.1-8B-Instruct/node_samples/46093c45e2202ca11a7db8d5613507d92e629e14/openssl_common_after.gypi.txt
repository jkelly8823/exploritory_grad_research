VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-32222
CVE Description:
A cryptographic vulnerability exists on Node.js on linux in versions of 18.x prior to 18.40.0 which allowed a default path for openssl.cnf that might be accessible under some circumstances to a non-admin user instead of /etc/ssl as was the case in versions prior to the upgrade to OpenSSL 3.  This vulnerability is related to the default path for
