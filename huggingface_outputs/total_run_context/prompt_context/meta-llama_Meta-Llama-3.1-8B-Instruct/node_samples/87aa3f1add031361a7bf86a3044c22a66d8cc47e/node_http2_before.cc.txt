 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a flood of empty frames, which can lead to a denial of service. The attacker can send a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag, causing the peer to spend time processing each frame disproportionate to the attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of empty frames that can be processed within a certain time frame.
2. Consider adding a check to ensure that the frame payload is not empty before processing it.
3. Use a more efficient algorithm to process frames, such as using a queue to handle incoming frames and processing them in batches. This can help reduce the CPU consumption caused by processing each frame individually. 4. Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent excessive frame processing. 5. Consider using a more robust HTTP/2 implementation that is less vulnerable to this type of attack. 6. Add a check to ensure that the frame is not a PUSH_PROMISE frame, as these can also be used to cause a denial of service. 7. Consider using a more efficient data structure to store and process frames, such as a ring
