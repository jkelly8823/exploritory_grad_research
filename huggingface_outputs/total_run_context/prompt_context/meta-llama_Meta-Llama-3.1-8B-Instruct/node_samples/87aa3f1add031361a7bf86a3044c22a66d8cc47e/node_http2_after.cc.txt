 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a flood of empty frames, which can lead to a denial of service. The attacker can send a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag, causing the peer to spend time processing each frame disproportionate to the attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust mechanism to detect and prevent flood attacks, such as tracking the number of frames received within a certain time window.
2. Consider adding a limit on the number of empty frames that can be received within a certain time frame.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is resistant to known vulnerabilities and attacks.  ```python
