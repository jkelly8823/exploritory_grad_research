 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission. This is because the code does not properly handle the `maxHeaderPairs` option, which can be used to limit the number of header pairs in a request. If `maxHeaderPairs` is set to a value greater than 0, the code will not properly handle requests with more than that number of header pairs, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set `maxHeaderPairs` to 0 to disable the limit on header pairs.
2. Implement a proper handling of the `maxHeaderPairs` option, such as checking the number of header pairs in the request and returning an error if it exceeds the limit.
3. Consider using a more robust HTTP parser that can handle large requests without becoming unresponsive.
