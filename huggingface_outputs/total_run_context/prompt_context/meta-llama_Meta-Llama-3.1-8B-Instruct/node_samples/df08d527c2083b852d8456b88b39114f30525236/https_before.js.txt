 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission. This is because the `headersTimeout` is set to 60 seconds, which is a relatively long time. An attacker could send a large number of requests with delayed headers, causing the server to become unresponsive and unable to accept new connections.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the `headersTimeout` value to a more reasonable limit, such as 10 seconds.
2. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent delayed requests submission, such as a rate limiting system.
3. Consider upgrading to Node.js 14.11.0 or later to fix the vulnerability.
