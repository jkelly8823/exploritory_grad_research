 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not directly contain any of the vulnerabilities listed. However, the presence of the `fs.symlink()` or `fs.symlinkSync()` methods suggests that the code may be vulnerable to an invalid symlink type being passed to these methods. This could potentially lead to a vulnerability if not properly validated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the symlink type before passing it to the `fs.symlink()` or `fs.symlinkSync()` methods.
- Ensure that the Node.js version is 14.11.0 or higher to prevent HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-8251
CVE Description:
Node.js < 14.11.0 is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept new connections. 

Code Sample:
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost
