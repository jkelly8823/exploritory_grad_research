 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission. This is because the parser.maxHeaderPairs is being checked and if it's greater than 0, the code will enter a loop that can be exploited to make the server unable to accept new connections. This is a known vulnerability in Node.js versions prior to 14.11.0.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade Node.js to version 14.11.0 or later to fix this vulnerability.
- Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse. 
- Review and refactor the code to ensure it's not vulnerable to other types of attacks.  ```
