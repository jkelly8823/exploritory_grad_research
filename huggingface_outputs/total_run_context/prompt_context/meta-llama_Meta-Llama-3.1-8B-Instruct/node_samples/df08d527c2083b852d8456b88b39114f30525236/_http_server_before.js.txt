 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DoS) attacks based on delayed requests submission. This is because the server is unable to accept new connections when delayed requests are submitted. The vulnerability is present in the `onParserTimeout` function where the `parser[kOnTimeout]` is set to `onParserTimeout.bind(undefined, server, socket)`. This can cause the server to become unresponsive and unable to accept new connections.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the `onParserTimeout` function should be modified to handle delayed requests in a way that does not cause the server to become unresponsive. One possible solution is to use a queue to handle delayed requests and ensure that the server can continue to accept new connections while processing the delayed requests. Additionally, the `keepAliveTimeout` property of the `HTTPServerAsyncResource` class should be set to a reasonable value to prevent the server from becoming unresponsive due to delayed requests.
