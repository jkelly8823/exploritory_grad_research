 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30581 because it uses the __proto__ property to set the require function on the process.mainModule object. This allows an attacker to bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition. The lines 9-10 are responsible for setting the require function on the process.mainModule object, which is a potential entry point for this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the use of __proto__ and instead use the Object.create() method to create a new object with the required properties.
2. Use a more secure method to set the require function on the process.mainModule object, such as using a secure function like require.resolve() to resolve the module path.
3. Consider using a more secure policy mechanism, such as the built-in policy mechanism in Node.js, to restrict the modules that can be required.
