 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30581 vulnerability because it uses the experimental policy mechanism and the __proto__ property to bypass the policy mechanism. This allows the code to require modules outside of the policy.json definition, which is a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the use of the experimental policy mechanism.
2. Update the policy.json file to include all required modules.
3. Use a secure method to require modules, such as using the require() function with a valid module path. 
4. Consider upgrading to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability. 
5. If the experimental policy mechanism is required, ensure that it is properly configured and that all required modules are listed in the policy.json file.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
