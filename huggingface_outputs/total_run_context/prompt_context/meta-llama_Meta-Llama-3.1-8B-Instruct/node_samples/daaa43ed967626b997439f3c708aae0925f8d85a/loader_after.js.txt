 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-30581 vulnerability because it uses the __proto__ property to set the require function on the __proto__ of the current object. This allows an attacker to bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the line that sets the require function on the __proto__ of the current object: `setOwnProperty(this.__proto__,'require', makeRequireFunction(this, redirects));`
2. Use a more secure approach to set the require function, such as using a secure property like `Object.defineProperty` to define the require function on the current object.
3. Consider disabling the experimental policy mechanism if it is not necessary for your use case. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30581
CVE Description:
The use of __proto__ in process.mainModule.__proto__.require() can bypass the policy mechanism and require modules outside of the policy.json definition. This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: v16, v18 and, v20.  Please note that at the
