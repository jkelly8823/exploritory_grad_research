 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-21892 due to the incorrect application of the exception for CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. The code checks if the capability is less than 32, which is not a valid condition to determine if the capability is only set. This allows unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the process's elevated privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the condition to correctly check if the capability is only set by checking if the corresponding bit in the cap_data array is set.
2. Use a more secure method to check for elevated privileges, such as using the `geteuid()` function to check the effective user ID. 
3. Consider using a capability-based access control system to restrict access to sensitive resources. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is not vulnerable to known security issues.  ```bash
