 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-21892 due to the incorrect application of the exception for CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. The code checks if the process has only the specified capability, but it does not correctly handle the case where other capabilities have been set. This allows an unprivileged user to inject code that inherits the process's elevated privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Correctly apply the exception for CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE by checking if the process has only the specified capability and no other capabilities.
2. Use a more secure method to check for capabilities, such as using the `prctl` system call to set the `PR_CAP_AMBIENT` flag.
3. Consider using a capability-based security framework, such as SELinux, to manage capabilities and prevent this type of vulnerability.  ```c
