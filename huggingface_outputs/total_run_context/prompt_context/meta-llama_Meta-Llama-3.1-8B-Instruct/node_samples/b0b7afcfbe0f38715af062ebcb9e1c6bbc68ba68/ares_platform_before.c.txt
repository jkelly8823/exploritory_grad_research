 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-1000381 vulnerability. The code snippet provided is related to retrieving the Windows OS version information using the `GetVersionEx` function, which does not seem to be related to the parsing of NAPTR responses or DNS packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and validate the code for any potential vulnerabilities.  The code could be improved by adding error checking for the `GetVersionEx` function to handle any potential errors that may occur.  Additionally, the code could be improved by using a more secure method to retrieve the OS version information, such as using the `GetVersionEx` function with the `OSVERSIONINFOEX` structure and checking the `dwOSVersionInfoSize` member to ensure it matches the expected size.  However, these are not related to the specified CVE.  The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2017-1000381
