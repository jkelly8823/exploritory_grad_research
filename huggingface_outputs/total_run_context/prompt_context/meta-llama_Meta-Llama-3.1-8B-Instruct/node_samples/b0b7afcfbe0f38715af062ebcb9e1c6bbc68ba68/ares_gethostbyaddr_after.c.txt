 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the c-ares function `ares_parse_naptr_reply()` which is the function that is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-1000381. The code sample appears to be a Windows-specific function that retrieves the path to the hosts file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the vulnerable function. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the code is properly sanitized to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks.  The use of `strcat()` is also not recommended as it can lead to buffer overflows if the source string is longer than the destination string. Consider using `strcpy()` or `strncpy()` instead.  Additionally, the use of `ExpandEnvironmentStringsA()` may also be a potential vulnerability if the environment variable is not properly sanitized.  It is recommended to review the code and ensure that all environment variables are properly sanitized before passing them to `ExpandEnvironmentStringsA()`.
