 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-1000381 vulnerability. The code is using the `GetVersionEx` function to retrieve the OS version information, which is a safe function and does not involve parsing NAPTR responses. The vulnerability is related to the `ares_parse_naptr_reply` function, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this specific CVE. However, it's always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to use secure coding practices.
