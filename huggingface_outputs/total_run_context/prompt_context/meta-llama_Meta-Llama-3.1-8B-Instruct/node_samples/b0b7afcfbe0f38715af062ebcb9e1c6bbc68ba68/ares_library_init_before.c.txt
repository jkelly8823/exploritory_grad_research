VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-1353
CVE Description:
The `getaddrinfo` function in the `getaddrinfo` implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.29 does not validate the string passed to the AI_CANONNAME field of the `addrinfo` structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow via a long string.

Code Sample:
struct addrinfo hints = {
 .ai_family = AF_UNSPEC,
 .ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM,
 .ai_protocol = IPPROTO
