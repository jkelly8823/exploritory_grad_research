 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-8625 because it uses the outdated IDNA 2003 standard to handle International Domain Names. This can lead to users unknowingly issuing network transfer requests to the wrong host. The vulnerability is present in lines 14-15 where the getaddrinfo function is called with the hostname parameter. The getaddrinfo function is not properly handling International Domain Names, which can lead to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the IDNA standard to the latest version (IDNA 2008 or IDNA 2010) to properly handle International Domain Names.
2. Use a library that supports the latest IDNA standard, such as the 'punycode' library.
3. Implement a custom function to handle International Domain Names, ensuring that it follows the latest IDNA standard.
