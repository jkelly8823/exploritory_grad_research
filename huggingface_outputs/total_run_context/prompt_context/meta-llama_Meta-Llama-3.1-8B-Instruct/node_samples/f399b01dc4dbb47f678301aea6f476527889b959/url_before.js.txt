 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the curl library or any other library that may be vulnerable to the CVE-2016-8625. The code appears to be a part of the Node.js core and is focused on string manipulation and error handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-8625. However, it is always a good practice to keep dependencies up to date and to use the latest version of Node.js to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```javascript
