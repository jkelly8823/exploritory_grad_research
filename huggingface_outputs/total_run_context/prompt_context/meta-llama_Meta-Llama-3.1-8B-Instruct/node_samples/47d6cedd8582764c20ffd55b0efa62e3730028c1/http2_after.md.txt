 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This is because the server does not have a timeout set for the 'unknownProtocol' event, allowing a malicious client to keep the connection open indefinitely.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should set a timeout for the 'unknownProtocol' event using the 'unknownProtocolTimeout' option. For example, you can set it to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) like this: `http2.createSecureServer({ unknownProtocolTimeout: 10000 });`. This will ensure that the server will destroy the socket after 10 seconds if it has not been destroyed by that time. Additionally, you can also register a listener for the 'unknownProtocol' event to handle the situation and prevent the denial of service attack.
