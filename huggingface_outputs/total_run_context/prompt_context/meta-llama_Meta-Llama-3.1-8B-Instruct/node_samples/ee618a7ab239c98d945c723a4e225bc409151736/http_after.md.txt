 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service due to the lack of a limit on the maximum incoming headers count. This allows an attacker to send headers very slowly, keeping HTTP or HTTPS connections and associated resources alive for a long period of time. The `server.headersTimeout` option is set to 40 seconds by default, which is not sufficient to prevent this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Set `server.headersTimeout` to a lower value, such as 1 second, to prevent Slowloris attacks.
2. Consider implementing a more robust solution, such as using a library like `express-rate-limit`, to limit the number of incoming requests and prevent abuse. 
3. Regularly review and update the `server.headersTimeout` value to ensure it remains effective against evolving threats.
