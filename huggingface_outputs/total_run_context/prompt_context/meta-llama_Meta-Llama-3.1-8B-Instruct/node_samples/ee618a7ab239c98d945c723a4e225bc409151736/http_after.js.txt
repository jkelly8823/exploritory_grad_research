 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service attack. This is because the `setUnrefTimeout` function is used to schedule the `resetCache` function to run after a delay of 1000 milliseconds minus the current milliseconds. This creates a situation where the `resetCache` function may not run immediately after the delay, allowing an attacker to send headers very slowly and keep the HTTP or HTTPS connections and associated resources alive for a long period of time.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust timing mechanism, such as `setTimeout` with a fixed delay, to schedule the `resetCache` function.
2. Consider using a more efficient caching mechanism, such as a simple object or a cache library, to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying cache objects.
3. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent Slowloris attacks, such as monitoring the number of connections and headers sent within a certain time period. VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE_ID:CVE-2018-12122 CVE Description: Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0,
