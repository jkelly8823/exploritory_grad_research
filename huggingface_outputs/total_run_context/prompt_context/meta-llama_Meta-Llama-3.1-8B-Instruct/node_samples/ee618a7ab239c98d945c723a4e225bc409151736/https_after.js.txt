 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service due to the large value of the headersTimeout property. This allows an attacker to send headers very slowly, keeping HTTP or HTTPS connections and associated resources alive for a long period of time.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set the headersTimeout property to a reasonable value, such as 30 seconds or less.
- Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent Slowloris attacks, such as monitoring connection duration and resetting connections that exceed a certain threshold.  ```javascript
this.headersTimeout = 30 * 1000; // 30 seconds
```  ```javascript
const slowlorisDetector = require('slowloris-detector');
//...
slowlorisDetector.on('slowloris-attack', () => {
  // Reset the connection or take other action to prevent the attack
});
```  ```javascript
```javascript
const slowlorisDetector = require('slowloris-detector');
//...
slowlorisDetector.on('slowloris-attack', () => {
  // Reset the connection or take other action to prevent the attack
});
```  ```javascript
```javascript
