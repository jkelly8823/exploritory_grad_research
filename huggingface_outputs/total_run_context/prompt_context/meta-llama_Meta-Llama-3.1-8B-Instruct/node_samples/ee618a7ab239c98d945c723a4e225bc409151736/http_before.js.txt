 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service attack. This is because the `setUnrefTimeout` function is used to schedule a timeout that will reset the `dateCache` variable after a short period of time. However, this timeout is not properly cleared when the `utcDate` function is called multiple times in quick succession. This can cause the `resetCache` function to be called multiple times, leading to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clear the timeout when the `utcDate` function is called multiple times in quick succession.
2. Use a more robust timing mechanism, such as `setTimeout` with a proper timeout value, to schedule the `resetCache` function.
3. Consider using a caching mechanism that is designed to handle concurrent access, such as a lock or a queue.
