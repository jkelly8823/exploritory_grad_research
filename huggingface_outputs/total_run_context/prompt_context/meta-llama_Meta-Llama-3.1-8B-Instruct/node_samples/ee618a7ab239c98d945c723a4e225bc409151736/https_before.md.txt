 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service due to the lack of a timeout for the HTTP or HTTPS connections. This allows an attacker to keep the connections alive for a long period of time, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Set a reasonable timeout for the HTTP or HTTPS connections using the `server.setTimeout()` method. For example: `server.setTimeout(30000);` sets the timeout to 30 seconds. This will prevent an attacker from keeping the connections alive for an extended period of time.
