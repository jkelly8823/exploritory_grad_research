 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to send headers very slowly, keeping HTTP or HTTPS connections and associated resources alive for a long period of time. The `setTimeout` function is used to set a timeout for the server, but it does not have any relation to the Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure against this vulnerability.
