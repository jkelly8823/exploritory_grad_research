 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a reset flood due to the lack of a mechanism to limit the number of rejected streams. The variable `rejected_stream_count_` is used to track the number of rejected streams, but it is not used to prevent the peer from sending an excessive number of invalid requests. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a mechanism to limit the number of rejected streams, such as a counter that increments for each rejected stream and decrements when a new stream is accepted. Once the counter reaches a certain threshold, the peer can be disconnected or a RST_STREAM frame can be sent to the peer. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to rate limit the number of streams that can be opened by the peer. This can help prevent the peer from sending an excessive number of invalid requests. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9514
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the
