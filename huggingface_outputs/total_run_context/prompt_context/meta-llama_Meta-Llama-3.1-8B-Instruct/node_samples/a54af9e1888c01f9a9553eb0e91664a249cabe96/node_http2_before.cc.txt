 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a reset flood, a type of denial-of-service attack. This is because it does not properly handle invalid requests over multiple streams, which can lead to an excessive memory or CPU consumption. The code checks for fatal errors and stream closure, but it does not account for the potential for a reset flood attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to limit the number of streams that can be opened by a client. This can be achieved by implementing a stream limit or a timeout for stream establishment. Additionally, the code should be updated to properly handle invalid requests over multiple streams, such as by ignoring or closing the streams instead of emitting an error. This will prevent the attacker from consuming excess memory or CPU resources. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9514
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames
