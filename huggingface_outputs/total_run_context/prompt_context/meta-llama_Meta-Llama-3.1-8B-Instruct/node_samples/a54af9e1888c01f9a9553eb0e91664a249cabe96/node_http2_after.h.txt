 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a reset flood, which can lead to a denial of service. This is because the code does not properly handle invalid input frames, and instead uses a counter to track the number of rejected streams and invalid frames. This can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a proper error handling mechanism to handle invalid input frames.
2. Use a more efficient data structure to track the number of rejected streams and invalid frames, such as a circular buffer.
3. Consider implementing a mechanism to limit the number of streams that can be opened by a peer. This can help prevent a reset flood attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-9514
CVE Description:
Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
