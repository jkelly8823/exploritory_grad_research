 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a reset flood attack, which can lead to a denial of service. This is because the code increments the `invalid_frame_count_` variable every time an invalid frame is received, and if this count exceeds 1000 and the `SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9514` flag is not set, the function returns 1. This allows an attacker to potentially consume excess memory or CPU by sending a large number of invalid requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust mechanism to handle invalid frames, such as queuing and rate limiting.
2. Consider using a more secure approach to detect and prevent reset flood attacks, such as using a separate thread or process to handle invalid frames.
3. Regularly review and update the `SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9514` flag to ensure it remains effective in preventing this vulnerability. 4. Consider adding additional logging or monitoring to detect and respond to potential reset flood attacks. 5. Implement a mechanism to reset the `invalid_frame_count_` variable when the `SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9514
