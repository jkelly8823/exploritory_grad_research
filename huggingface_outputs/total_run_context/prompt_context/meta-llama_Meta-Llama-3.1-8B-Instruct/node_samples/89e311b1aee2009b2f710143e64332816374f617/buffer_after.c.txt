 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of proper bounds checking in the BUF_MEM_new function. The function does not check if the length of the buffer exceeds the maximum allowed size before allocating memory for it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the buffer is greater than the maximum allowed size, causing a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the length of the buffer does not exceed the maximum allowed size before allocating memory for it.
2. Use a safer memory allocation function that can handle buffer overflows, such as OPENSSL_malloc_secure.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the buffer data.
