 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-39333 due to the use of the `--experimental-wasm-modules` command line option. This option enables the experimental WebAssembly module feature, which is vulnerable to maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module. The code is using this feature to import WebAssembly modules, which makes it vulnerable to code injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `--experimental-wasm-modules` command line option to disable the experimental WebAssembly module feature.
2. Use a secure version of Node.js that does not have this vulnerability.
3. Use a WebAssembly module that is trusted and does not contain malicious code. 
4. Validate the input to the WebAssembly module to prevent code injection attacks. 
5. Consider using a different approach to achieve the desired functionality without using the vulnerable feature. 6. Keep the Node.js version up to date to ensure that any future security patches are applied. 7. Use a code analysis tool to identify and fix any potential security vulnerabilities in the code. 8. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 9. Use a secure
