 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-39333 because it uses the `--experimental-wasm-modules` command line option, which enables the vulnerable feature. This option allows maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module to inject JavaScript code, potentially accessing data and functions that the WebAssembly module itself does not have access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the `--experimental-wasm-modules` command line option unless absolutely necessary.
2. If using this option, ensure that the WebAssembly module is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious code injection.
3. Consider upgrading to a version of Node.js that does not have this vulnerability. 
4. If possible, use a secure alternative to WebAssembly modules, such as a secure JavaScript module.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-39333
CVE Description:
Maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module can inject JavaScript code. The injected code may be able to access data and functions that the WebAssembly module itself does not have access to, similar to as if the WebAssembly module was a JavaScript module.
