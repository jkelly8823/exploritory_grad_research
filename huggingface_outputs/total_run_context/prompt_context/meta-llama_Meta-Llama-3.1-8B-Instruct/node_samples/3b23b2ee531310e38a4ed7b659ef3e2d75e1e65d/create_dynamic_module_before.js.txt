 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The createExport function is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-39333 vulnerability. This is because it allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through the expt parameter. The function does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that can access data and functions that the WebAssembly module does not have access to.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize the input to the createExport function by using a whitelist of allowed characters.
2. Use a secure method to generate the export name, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
3. Remove the import.meta.exports.${name} assignment, as it is not necessary and can be used to inject malicious code.
4. Consider using a more secure method to create exports, such as using a library that provides secure export creation functionality.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-39333
CVE Description:
Maliciously crafted export names in an imported WebAssembly module can inject JavaScript code. The injected code may be able to access data and functions that the WebAssembly module itself does not have access to, similar to as if the WebAssembly
