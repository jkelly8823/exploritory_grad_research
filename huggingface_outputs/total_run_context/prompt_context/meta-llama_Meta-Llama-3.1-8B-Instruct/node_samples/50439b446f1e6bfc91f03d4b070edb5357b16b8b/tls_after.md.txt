 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531 due to the presence of `uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative names. However, the vulnerability has been addressed in later versions of Node.js, and the code snippet explicitly mentions that support for `uniformResourceIdentifier` subject alternative names has been disabled in response to CVE-2021-44531.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as the vulnerability has been addressed in the code snippet itself. However, it is recommended to ensure that the Node.js version being used is up-to-date to prevent any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, if custom `options.checkServerIdentity` function is implemented, it should be reviewed to ensure it does not reintroduce the vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44531
