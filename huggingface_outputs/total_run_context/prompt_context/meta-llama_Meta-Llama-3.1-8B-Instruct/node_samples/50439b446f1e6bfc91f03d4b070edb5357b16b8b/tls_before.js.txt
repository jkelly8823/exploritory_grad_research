 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531 because it accepts URI SAN types without properly matching the URI. This can result in bypassing name-constrained intermediates. The code does not correctly match the URI when a protocol allows URI SANs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that has the fix for CVE-2021-44531 (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1).
2. Disable the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname using the --security-revert command-line option.
3. Implement proper URI matching when a protocol allows URI SANs. This can be done by checking the scheme of the URI and ensuring it matches the protocol being used. 
4. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a dedicated library for certificate validation.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
