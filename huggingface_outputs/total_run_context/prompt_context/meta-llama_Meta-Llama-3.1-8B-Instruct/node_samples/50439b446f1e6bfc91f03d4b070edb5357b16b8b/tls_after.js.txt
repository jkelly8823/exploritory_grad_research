 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531 because it accepts arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, specifically URI SAN types, which can result in bypassing name-constrained intermediates. The code does not correctly match the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2021-44531 (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. Disable the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname by using the --security-revert command-line option. 
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle Subject Alternative Names, such as only accepting specific SAN types that are defined by the PKI. 4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security standards. 5. Consider using a security audit tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 6. Implement a secure coding practice to handle certificate validation and verification. 7. Consider using a library or
