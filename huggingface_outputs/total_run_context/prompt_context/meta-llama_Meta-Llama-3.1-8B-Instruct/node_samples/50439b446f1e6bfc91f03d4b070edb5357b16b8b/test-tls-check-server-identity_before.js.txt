 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531 because it accepts arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, which can result in bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Specifically, the code does not correctly match the URI in the SAN type, allowing for potential attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2021-44531 (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1).
2. Disable the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname using the --security-revert command-line option.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent bypassing name-constrained intermediates, such as using a PKI that specifically defines the SAN types to use.  VULNERABLE: YES
