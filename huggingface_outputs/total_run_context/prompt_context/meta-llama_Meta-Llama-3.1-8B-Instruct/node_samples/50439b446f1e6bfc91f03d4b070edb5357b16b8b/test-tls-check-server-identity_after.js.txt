 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531 because it does not correctly match the URI in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) type when checking a certificate against a hostname. This is evident in the second and third code samples where the URI SAN type is not correctly matched, allowing for bypassing name-constrained intermediates.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2021-44531 (12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1 or later).
2. If using an older version of Node.js, consider disabling the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname using the --security-revert command-line option.
3. Implement additional security measures to ensure correct matching of the URI in the SAN type. This may involve using a more robust certificate validation library or implementing custom certificate validation logic.  ```
