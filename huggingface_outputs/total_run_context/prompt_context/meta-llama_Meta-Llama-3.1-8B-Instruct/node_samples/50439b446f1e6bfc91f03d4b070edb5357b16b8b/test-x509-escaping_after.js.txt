VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2021-44531 vulnerability. The code is using the tls module to create a server and client, but it is not accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types. The code is specifically checking for the presence of a dNSName subject alternative name, which is a requirement to prevent bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Additionally, the code is using the X509Certificate class to verify the certificate, which is not vulnerable to the issue described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to prevent the CVE-2021-44531 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and to regularly review the code for any potential vulnerabilities. 

Note: The code sample provided is a test case for the tls module in Node.js, and it is not intended
