 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22019 vulnerability because it does not properly handle chunked encoding in HTTP requests. The `requestChunkExtensionsTooLargeResponse` buffer is created with a large chunk extension, which can cause the server to read an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a limit on the number of chunk extensions allowed in a single request.
2. Use a more secure method to handle chunked encoding, such as using a library that properly handles chunk extension bytes.
3. Consider using a more secure HTTP server implementation that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22019
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard
