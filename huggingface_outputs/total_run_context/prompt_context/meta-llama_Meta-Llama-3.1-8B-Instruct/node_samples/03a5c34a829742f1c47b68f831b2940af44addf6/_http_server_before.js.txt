 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22019 vulnerability due to the use of chunked encoding without proper validation. The `socketOnError` function handles errors, but it does not prevent the server from reading an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability and cause resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a limit on the number of chunk extension bytes that can be read from a single connection.
2. Validate the chunked encoding headers to prevent malicious requests.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against this type of vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Log4j library allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the logging system, leading to remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability occurs when the library is configured to use a malicious JNDI lookup, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary code.

Code Sample:
const log4j = require('log4j');
const logger = log4j.getLogger
