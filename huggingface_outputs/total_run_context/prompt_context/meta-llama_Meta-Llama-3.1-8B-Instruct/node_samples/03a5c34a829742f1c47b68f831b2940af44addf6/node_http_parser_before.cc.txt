 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22019 vulnerability due to the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The `on_chunk_extension_name` and `on_chunk_extension_value` callbacks are set to `nullptr`, which means that the parser does not handle chunk extension bytes. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a handler for chunk extension bytes by setting the `on_chunk_extension_name` and `on_chunk_extension_value` callbacks to valid functions.
2. Limit the number of chunk extension bytes that can be read from a single connection to prevent resource exhaustion.
3. Consider implementing a timeout or body size limit to prevent DoS attacks.

CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22019
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk
