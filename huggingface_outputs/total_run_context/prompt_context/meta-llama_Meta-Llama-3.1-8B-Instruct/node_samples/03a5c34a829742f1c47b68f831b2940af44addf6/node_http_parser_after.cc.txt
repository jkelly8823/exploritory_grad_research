 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22019 vulnerability due to the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The `on_chunk_extension` function reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, which can cause resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a limit on the number of chunk extension bytes that can be read from a single connection.
2. Consider using a more robust parsing library that handles chunked encoding correctly.
3. Add a timeout to prevent the server from reading an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22019
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like timeouts and body size limits.
