 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the monkey-patching of the path.resolve function. This allows an attacker to bypass the permission model by providing a path that traverses outside of the intended directory. Additionally, the code is also vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the concatenation of the allowedFolder path with extra characters, which can be used to traverse outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the monkey-patching of the path.resolve function to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Use a secure method to resolve paths, such as using the built-in path.resolve function without monkey-patching it.
3. Validate user input to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be done by checking if the provided path is within the allowed directory. 
4. Consider using a library that provides secure path resolution, such as the 'path' module in Node.js. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-21891
CVE Description: 
Node.js depends on multiple built-in utility functions to normalize paths provided to node:fs functions, which can be overwitten with user-defined implementations leading
