 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-21891 due to the experimental permission model being used. The permission model is an experimental feature in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21, and it can be bypassed through path traversal attacks. The code attempts to freeze the path module to prevent monkey-patching, but this is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a version of Node.js that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as Node.js 22 or later.
2. Disable the experimental permission model by setting the `--experimental-permission` flag to `false` when running the application.
3. Use a secure alternative to the `path` module, such as the `path-browserify` package. 
4. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent path traversal attacks. 5. Consider using a more secure Node.js version, such as Node.js 22 or later, which has addressed this vulnerability. 6. If possible, refactor the code to avoid using the experimental permission model. 7. Consider using a security-focused module, such as `path
