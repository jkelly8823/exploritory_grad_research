 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the monkey-patching of the path module's resolve function. This allows an attacker to bypass the permission model and access files outside of the intended directory. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the path.resolve function is overridden with a user-defined implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid monkey-patching built-in modules, especially those related to file system operations.
2. Use a secure method to normalize paths, such as using the built-in path.normalize function.
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks.
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides secure file system operations, such as the 'fs-extra' package. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-21891
CVE Description:
Node.js depends on multiple built-in utility functions to normalize paths provided to node:fs functions, which can be overwitten with user-defined implementations leading to filesystem permission model bypass through path traversal attack.
This vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21.
