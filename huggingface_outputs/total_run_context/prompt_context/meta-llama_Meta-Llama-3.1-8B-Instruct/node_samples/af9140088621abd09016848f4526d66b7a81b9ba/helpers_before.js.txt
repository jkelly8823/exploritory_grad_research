 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-23918 privilege escalation vulnerability. This is because the code uses process.mainModule.require() to load modules, which can bypass the experimental Permissions feature in Node.js. This allows an attacker to access non-authorized modules.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (>=19.6.1, >=18.14.1, >=16.19.1, >=14.21.3).
2. Disable the experimental Permissions feature by removing the --experimental-policy flag.
3. Use a secure module loading mechanism, such as ES modules or a module loader that does not use process.mainModule.require(). VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-23918
