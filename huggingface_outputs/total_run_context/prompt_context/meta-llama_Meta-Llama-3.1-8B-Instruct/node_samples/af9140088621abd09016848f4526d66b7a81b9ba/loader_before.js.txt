 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-23918 because it uses process.mainModule.require() which can bypass the experimental Permissions feature in Node.js and access non-authorized modules.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to version 19.6.1 or later, 18.14.1 or later, 16.19.1 or later, or 14.21.3 or later.
2. Disable the experimental permissions option with --no-experimental-policy.
3. Use a secure module loading mechanism, such as ES modules, instead of the require() function. 
4. Implement a custom permissions system to restrict access to sensitive modules. 
5. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure. 
6. Use a security-focused module loader, such as `@types/node` or `node-secure-loader`. 
7. Consider using a secure module loading mechanism, such as ES modules, instead of the require() function. 
8. Implement a custom permissions system to restrict access to sensitive modules. 
9. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure.
