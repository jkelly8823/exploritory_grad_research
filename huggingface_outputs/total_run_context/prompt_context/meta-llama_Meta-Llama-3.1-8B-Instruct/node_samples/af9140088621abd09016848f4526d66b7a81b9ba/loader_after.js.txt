 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the use of process.mainModule.require() without proper validation. This allows an attacker to bypass the experimental Permissions feature in Node.js and access non-authorized modules.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to process.mainModule.require() to ensure it is a valid module.
2. Use a secure method to load modules, such as using the require() function with a valid module path.
3. Disable the experimental Permissions feature in Node.js to prevent this vulnerability.
4. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (Node.js >= 19.6.1, >= 18.14.1, >= 16.19.1, >= 14.21.3).
