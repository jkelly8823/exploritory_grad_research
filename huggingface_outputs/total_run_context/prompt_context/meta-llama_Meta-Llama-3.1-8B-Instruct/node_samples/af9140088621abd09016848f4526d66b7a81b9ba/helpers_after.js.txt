 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-23918 privilege escalation vulnerability. This is because the code uses process.mainModule.require() to bypass the experimental Permissions feature in Node.js. This allows an attacker to access non-authorized modules, which can lead to privilege escalation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (>=19.6.1, >=18.14.1, >=16.19.1, >=14.21.3).
2. Disable the experimental Permissions feature by removing the --experimental-policy flag.
3. Use a secure alternative to process.mainModule.require(), such as require.resolve() or require.cache. 
4. Implement additional security measures, such as access control lists or role-based access control, to prevent unauthorized access to modules. 
5. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure they are secure and up-to-date.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
