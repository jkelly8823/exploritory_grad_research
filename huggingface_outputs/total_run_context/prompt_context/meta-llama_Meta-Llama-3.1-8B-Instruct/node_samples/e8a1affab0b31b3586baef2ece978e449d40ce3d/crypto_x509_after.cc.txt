 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to the potential for a non-expect termination when an invalid public key is used to create an x509 certificate. This is because the process terminates when accessing public key info of provided certificates from user code, causing a DoS scenario.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the validity of the public key before creating the x509 certificate.
2. Implement a try-catch block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the creation of the x509 certificate.
3. Consider using a more robust method to handle the creation of the x509 certificate, such as using a secure key generation algorithm. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30588
CVE Description: 
When an invalid public key is used to create an x509 certificate using the crypto.X509Certificate() API a non-expect termination occurs making it susceptible to DoS attacks when the attacker could force interruptions of application processing, as the process terminates when accessing public key info of provided certificates from user code. The current context of the users will be gone, and that will cause a DoS scenario. This vulnerability affects
