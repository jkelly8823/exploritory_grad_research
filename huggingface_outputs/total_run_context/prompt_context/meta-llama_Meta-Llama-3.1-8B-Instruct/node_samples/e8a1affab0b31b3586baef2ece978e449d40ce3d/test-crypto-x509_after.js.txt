VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to the crypto.X509Certificate() API terminating unexpectedly when an invalid public key is used to create an x509 certificate. This is a known issue in Node.js versions v16, v18, and v20.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a supported version of Node.js that does not have this vulnerability.
2. Use a library that provides a more robust implementation of x509 certificate parsing, such as `openssl`.
3. Implement additional error handling to prevent the application from terminating unexpectedly. This could involve catching the error and logging it, or returning an error response to the user. 
4. Validate the public key before creating the x509 certificate to prevent the use of invalid keys. This could involve checking the key format and length, or using a library to validate the key. 
5. Consider using a more secure method of creating x509 certificates, such as using a trusted certificate authority. 
6. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure and up-to-date. 
7. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
