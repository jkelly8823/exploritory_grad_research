 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be written in Node.js, but rather in C++. The vulnerability described in CVE-2023-30588 is specific to the crypto.X509Certificate() API in Node.js, which is not present in this code. The code uses the OpenSSL library (EVPKeyPointer, X509_get_pubkey, etc.) to work with X.509 certificates, which is a different implementation than the Node.js crypto module.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is properly secured. Additionally, if the code is intended to be used in a Node.js environment, it should be rewritten to use the Node.js crypto module instead of OpenSSL.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-30588
CVE Description:
When an invalid public key is used to create an x509 certificate using the crypto.X509Certificate() API a non-expect termination occurs making it susceptible to DoS attacks when the attacker could force interruptions of application processing, as the process terminates when accessing
