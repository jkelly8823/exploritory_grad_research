 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the Node.js application described in the vulnerability. The code seems to be handling DNS-related data structures and freeing memory allocated for them, which is a common practice in DNS resolution. However, the specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE description (CVE-2020-8277) is related to a Denial of Service caused by a DNS request with a large number of responses, which is not directly related to the code snippet provided.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be handling DNS-related data structures correctly and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE description. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it is free from any potential issues.
