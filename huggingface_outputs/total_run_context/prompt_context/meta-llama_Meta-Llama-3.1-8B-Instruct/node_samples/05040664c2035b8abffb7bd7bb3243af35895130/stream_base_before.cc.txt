 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is checking if the offset is less than the storage size before accessing the storage, which prevents a potential out-of-bounds access. Additionally, the code is using the ROUND_UP function to align the offset, which suggests that the code is designed to handle memory allocation and deallocation in a way that prevents memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the described vulnerability.  ```
