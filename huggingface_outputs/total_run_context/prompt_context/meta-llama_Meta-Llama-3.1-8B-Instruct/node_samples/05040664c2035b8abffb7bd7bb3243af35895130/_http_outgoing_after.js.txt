 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the lack of input validation on the 'data' parameter. An attacker could send a large amount of data to the connection, causing the connection to become unresponsive and leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the length of the 'data' parameter to prevent large amounts of data from being sent to the connection.
- Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse.
- Use a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during the write operation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
```javascript
const express = require('express');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```
