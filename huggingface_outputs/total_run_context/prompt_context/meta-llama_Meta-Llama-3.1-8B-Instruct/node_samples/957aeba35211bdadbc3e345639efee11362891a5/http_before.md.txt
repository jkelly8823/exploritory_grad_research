EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121) because the `server.headersTimeout` option is set to a default value of `40000`, which is a relatively short timeout period. This can be exploited by an attacker to send a large number of requests with maximum-sized headers, causing the server to abort from heap allocation failure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Increase the `server.headersTimeout` value to a more reasonable timeout period, such as `60000` or higher, to prevent Denial of Service attacks.
* Consider implementing a load balancer or other proxy layer to mitigate the attack potential. 
* Regularly review and update the `server.headersTimeout` value to ensure it remains secure.  VULNERABLE: YES

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service (CVE-2018-12122) because the `server.headersTimeout` option is set to a default value of `40000`, which is a relatively short timeout period. This can be exploited by an attacker to send headers very slowly
