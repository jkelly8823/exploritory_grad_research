 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to the use of ObjectCreate(null) which creates an object with a null prototype. This allows an attacker to pollute the prototype of the object by assigning a value to a key that is not present in the object. In this case, the code is using ObjectCreate(null) to create a new object, and then iterating over the keys of the tabularData object using ObjectKeys(tabularData). This makes it possible for an attacker to assign a value to a key that is not present in the tabularData object, effectively polluting the prototype of the object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use ObjectCreate({}) instead of ObjectCreate(null) to create an object with a non-null prototype.
2. Use ObjectDefineProperty to define a property on the object, instead of assigning a value to a key that is not present in the object.
3. Use a more secure method to iterate over the keys of the tabularData object, such as using a for...in loop or a for...of loop.
