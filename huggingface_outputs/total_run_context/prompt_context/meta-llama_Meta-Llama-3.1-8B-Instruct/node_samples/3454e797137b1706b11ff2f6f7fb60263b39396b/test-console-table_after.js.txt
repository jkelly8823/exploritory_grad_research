 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to the use of the "console.table()" function with user-controlled input passed to the "properties" parameter. This allows an attacker to assign an empty string to numerical keys of the object prototype, which can lead to unintended modifications to the object prototype.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the "console.table()" function with user-controlled input passed to the "properties" parameter.
2. Use a secure alternative to "console.table()" that does not allow prototype pollution.
3. If using Node.js versions 12.22.9, 14.18.3, 16.13.2, or 17.3.1, ensure that the object being modified has a null prototype. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-21824
CVE Description: 
Due to the formatting logic of the "console.table()" function it was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the "properties" parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be "__proto__". The prototype pollution has very limited control, in
