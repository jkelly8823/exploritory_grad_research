 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to the use of the "ObjectKeys" function, which returns an array of property names for the given object. The "ObjectKeys" function does not perform any validation on the input object, making it susceptible to prototype pollution attacks. In this case, the "tabularData" object is being passed to the "ObjectKeys" function without any validation, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the prototype of the object.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input object "tabularData" to ensure it does not contain any malicious properties that could be used to pollute the prototype.
2. Use a safer alternative to "ObjectKeys", such as "ObjectGetOwnPropertyNames" which returns an array of property names that are directly on the object, rather than its prototype.
3. Consider using a library like "lodash" which has a safer implementation of "ObjectKeys" that performs validation on the input object.
