 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct usage of the "console.table()" function or any user-controlled input being passed to it. However, the presence of a table-like structure in the code sample suggests that it might be related to the "console.table()" function. Nevertheless, without explicit usage or user-controlled input, it's challenging to confirm the vulnerability. Nevertheless, the code sample does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the described issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code for any potential usage of the "console.table()" function or similar functions that might be vulnerable to prototype pollution.
2. Ensure that any user-controlled input is properly sanitized and validated before passing it to any functions that might be vulnerable to prototype pollution. 
3. Consider using a linter or code analyzer to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 4. Regularly update Node.js to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches. 5. Consider using a code security scanner to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 6. Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent prototype pollution. 7. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using user-controlled input directly in
