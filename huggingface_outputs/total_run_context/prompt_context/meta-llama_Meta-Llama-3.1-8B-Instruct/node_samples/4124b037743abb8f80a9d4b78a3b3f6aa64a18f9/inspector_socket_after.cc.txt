 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to OS Command Injection due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check. The check can be bypassed because IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP address is invalid before making DBS requests, allowing rebinding attacks. This is a known issue in Node.js versions <14.21.1, <16.18.1, <18.12.1, <19.0.1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update Node.js to a version that is not vulnerable (>=14.21.1, >=16.18.1, >=18.12.1, >=19.0.1).
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the IP address is valid and routable before making DBS requests.
3. Consider using a more secure method for validating IP addresses, such as using a library that provides robust IP address validation.
