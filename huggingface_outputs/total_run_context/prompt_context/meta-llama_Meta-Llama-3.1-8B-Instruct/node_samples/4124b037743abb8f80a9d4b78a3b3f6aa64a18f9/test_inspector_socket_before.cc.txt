 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to OS Command Injection due to the lack of proper validation of the Host IP address. The line `send_in_chunks(INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST.c_str(),` sends a request with a Host IP address that is non-routable (0.0.0.0), which can be exploited to bypass the IsAllowedHost check and potentially lead to rebinding attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the Host IP address to ensure it is a valid and routable IP address before making DBS requests.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent OS Command Injection attacks.
3. Update the code to use a secure method for making DBS requests, such as using a secure protocol like HTTPS.  ```c
