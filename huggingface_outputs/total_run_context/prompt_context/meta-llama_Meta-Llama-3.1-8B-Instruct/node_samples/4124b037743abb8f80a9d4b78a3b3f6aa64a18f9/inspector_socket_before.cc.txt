 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a larger implementation for handling WebSocket connections. The `IsIPAddress` function is used to validate whether a given host string represents an IP address. However, upon closer inspection, it seems that this function is not directly related to the OS Command Injection vulnerability described in the provided CVE. The vulnerability is mentioned to be present in Node.js versions due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check, which is not implemented in this code snippet. The code snippet appears to be a part of a C++ implementation, which is not affected by the mentioned vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and validate the implementation of the `IsIPAddress` function to ensure it correctly handles IP address validation. Additionally, consider implementing input validation and sanitization for any user-supplied input to prevent potential security issues.  ```python
```python
def is_ip_address(host):
    if host.startswith('[') and host.endswith(']'):
        return True
    if host.startswith('0'):
        return False
    parts = host.split('.')
