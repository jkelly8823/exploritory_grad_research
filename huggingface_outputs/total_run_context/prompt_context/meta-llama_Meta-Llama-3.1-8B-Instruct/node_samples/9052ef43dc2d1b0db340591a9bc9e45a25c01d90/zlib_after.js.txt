 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22025 vulnerability. The code does not utilize the fetch() function, which is the primary entry point for the vulnerability. The code is focused on handling input and output buffers, and does not involve any URL decoding or resource exhaustion attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with sensitive data or critical systems. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and error handling, to ensure the overall security and reliability of the code.  ```javascript
function validateInput(input) {
  if (typeof input!=='string') {
    throw new Error('Input must be a string');
  }
  if (input.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Input cannot be empty');
  }
  return input;
}

function handleInput(input) {
  try {
    const validatedInput = validateInput(input);
    // Process the validated input
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
