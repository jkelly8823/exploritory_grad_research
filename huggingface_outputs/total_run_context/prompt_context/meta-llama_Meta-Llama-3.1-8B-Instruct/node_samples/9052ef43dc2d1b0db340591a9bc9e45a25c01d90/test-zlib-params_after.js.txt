 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22025 vulnerability. The code does not use the fetch() function, which is the primary attack vector for this vulnerability. The code is using the zlib library to compress and decompress data, which is not related to the fetch() function or the Brotli decoding issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to this issue, and no changes are necessary. However, it's always a good practice to keep your dependencies up to date, including Node.js and the zlib library. This can help ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  The code does use a while loop that could potentially cause a resource exhaustion if the input is very large, but this is not related to the CVE-2024-22025 vulnerability. It would be a good idea to consider adding a check to prevent this type of resource exhaustion.  Consider adding a check to prevent this type of resource exhaustion.
