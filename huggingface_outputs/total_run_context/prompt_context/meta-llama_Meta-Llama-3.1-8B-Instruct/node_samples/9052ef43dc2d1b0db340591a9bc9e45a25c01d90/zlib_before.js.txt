 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the Denial of Service (DoS) attack described in CVE-2024-22025. The code does not use the fetch() function, which is the primary vector for the vulnerability. The code is focused on handling input and output buffers, and does not involve URL decoding or resource exhaustion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with untrusted input. Consider implementing additional checks and validation for input data to ensure the code remains secure.  ```python
