 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22025 vulnerability. The code is using the `deflater` object to compress data, which is not related to the `fetch()` function or the Brotli decoding issue described in the vulnerability. The code is also using a custom compression algorithm, which is not affected by the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22025 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the custom compression algorithm is properly implemented and tested. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the Node.js version up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```bash
