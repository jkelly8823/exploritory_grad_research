 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code snippet is a function that checks if a given string is an IP address. It does not contain any code that would allow for OS command injection or DNS rebinding attacks. The function checks for the presence of square brackets at the start and end of the string, and then checks each character in the string to ensure it is a valid IP address. This function does not make any database requests or allow for rebinding attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the described vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure.
