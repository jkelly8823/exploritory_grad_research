VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-0732 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a DH(E) based ciphersuite in a TLS handshake, which is susceptible to a Denial Of Service attack. The vulnerability is present in the line where the TLS handshake is initiated.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use a secure ciphersuite, such as ECDHE. Additionally, the code should be updated to handle large prime values sent by a malicious server. This can be achieved by implementing a timeout mechanism to prevent the client from spending an unreasonably long period of time generating a key.
