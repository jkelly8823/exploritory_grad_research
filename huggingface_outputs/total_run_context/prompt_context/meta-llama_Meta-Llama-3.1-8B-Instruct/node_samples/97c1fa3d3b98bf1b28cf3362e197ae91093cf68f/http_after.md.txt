 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a YAML documentation snippet describing changes to the `http.get()` and `http.request()` methods in Node.js. There is no code that could potentially lead to a buffer overflow, misuse of `Buffer.alloc()`, or a Denial of Service attack through a TLS handshake.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is a documentation snippet and does not contain any executable code that could be vulnerable to the listed CVEs.  -->VULNERABLE: NO
