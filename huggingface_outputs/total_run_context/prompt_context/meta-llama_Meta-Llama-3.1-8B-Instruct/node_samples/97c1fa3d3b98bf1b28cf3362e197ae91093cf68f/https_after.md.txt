 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2018-0732 due to the use of a DH(E) based ciphersuite in a TLS handshake. This vulnerability can be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Upgrade to a version of OpenSSL that is not affected by this vulnerability, such as OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev or OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev.
- Consider using a different ciphersuite that is not vulnerable to this issue. 
- Ensure that the DH(E) parameters are properly validated and sanitized to prevent a malicious server from sending a very large prime value.
