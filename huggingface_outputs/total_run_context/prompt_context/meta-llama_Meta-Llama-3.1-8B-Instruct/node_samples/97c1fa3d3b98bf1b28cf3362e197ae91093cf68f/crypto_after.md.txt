 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-0732 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a DH(E) based ciphersuite in a TLS handshake, which is susceptible to a Denial Of Service attack. The vulnerability is caused by a malicious server sending a very large prime value to the client, causing the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use a secure ciphersuite, such as RSA or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH). Additionally, the code should be updated to handle large prime values in a secure manner. This can be achieved by implementing a timeout or a limit on the maximum prime value that can be processed.
