 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-0732 vulnerability. This is because the code is using a DH(E) based ciphersuite in a TLS handshake, which is susceptible to a Denial Of Service attack. The vulnerability is present in the line where the changes are being documented, specifically in the YAML section where the version is being replaced.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use a secure ciphersuite, such as ECDHE. Additionally, the code should be updated to handle large prime values in a way that prevents a Denial Of Service attack. This can be achieved by implementing a timeout or a limit on the amount of time spent generating a key.
