 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-22017 because it uses `io_uring` which is enabled by the `UV_USE_IO_URING` environment variable. This allows the process to perform privileged operations despite having dropped such privileges through a call to `process.setuid()`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should disable `io_uring` by setting `UV_USE_IO_URING` to `0` in your environment. Alternatively, you can ensure that the process does not change its user identity at runtime by removing any calls to `process.setuid()` or native addons that can invoke system functions like `setuid(2)`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22017
CVE Description:
setuid() does not affect libuv's internal io_uring operations if initialized before the call to setuid().
This allows the process to perform privileged operations despite presumably having dropped such privileges through a call to setuid().
This vulnerability affects all users using version greater or equal than Node.js 18.18.0, Node.js 20.4.0 and Node.js 21.
