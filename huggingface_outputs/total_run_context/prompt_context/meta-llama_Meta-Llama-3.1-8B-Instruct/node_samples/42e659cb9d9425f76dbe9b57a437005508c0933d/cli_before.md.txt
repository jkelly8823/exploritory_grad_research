 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that utilizes the setuid() function or libuv's internal io_uring operations. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2024-22017 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any code that uses setuid() or other privileged operations is properly audited and tested for vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-22017
CVE Description:
setuid() does not affect libuv's internal io_uring operations if initialized before the call to setuid().
This allows the process to perform privileged operations despite presumably having dropped such privileges through a call to setuid().
This vulnerability affects all users using version greater or equal than Node.js 18.18.0, Node.js 20.4.0 and Node.js 21.  ```javascript
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World\n
