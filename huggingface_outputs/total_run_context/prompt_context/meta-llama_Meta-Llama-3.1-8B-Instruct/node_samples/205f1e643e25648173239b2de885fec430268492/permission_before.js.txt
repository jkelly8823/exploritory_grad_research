 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-30584 because it does not properly handle path traversal when verifying file permissions. The `resolve` function is used to resolve the `reference` path, but it does not prevent path traversal attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `reference` path to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `path.resolve` function with the `root` option to prevent path traversal attacks. For example:
```javascript
const resolvedReference = path.resolve(reference, { root: path.dirname(reference) });
```
This will ensure that the `reference` path is resolved relative to the current working directory, preventing path traversal attacks. Additionally, you can also use the `path.posix.join` function to join the `reference` path with the current working directory, which will also prevent path traversal attacks. For example:
```javascript
const resolvedReference = path.posix.join(process.cwd(), reference);
