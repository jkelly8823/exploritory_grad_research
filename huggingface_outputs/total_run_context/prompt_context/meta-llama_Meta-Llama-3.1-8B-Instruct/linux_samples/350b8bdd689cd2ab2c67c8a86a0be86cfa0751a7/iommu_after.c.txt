 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) due to the miscalculation of the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where the guest OS triggers a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages. The vulnerability is present in the kvm_iommu_map_pages function, specifically in the lines where the number of pages is calculated and the unpin_pages function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly handle the case where the guest OS triggers a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.
2. Update the calculation of the number of pages to accurately reflect the number of pages that need to be unpin.
3. Consider implementing additional checks to prevent the guest OS from triggering a large gfn value that leads to memory corruption.
