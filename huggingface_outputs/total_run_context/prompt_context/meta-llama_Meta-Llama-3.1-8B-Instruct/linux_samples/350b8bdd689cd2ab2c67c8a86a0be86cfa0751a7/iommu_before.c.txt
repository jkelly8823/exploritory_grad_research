 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) due to the miscalculation of the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure. This is because the gfn value is incremented by page_size >> PAGE_SHIFT, which can lead to permanently pinned pages.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix the miscalculation of the number of pages by correctly calculating the end_gfn value.
2. Add a check to prevent the gfn value from being incremented beyond the maximum allowed value.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure to manage the mapping of pages to prevent similar issues in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3601
CVE Description:
The kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to (1) cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value or (2) cause a denial of service
