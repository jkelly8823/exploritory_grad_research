VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to insufficient validation of user-supplied sizes for the MSG_CRYPTO message type. The TIPC_SKB_CB(skb)->decrypted check does not prevent a malicious user from sending a large MSG_CRYPTO message, which can cause a buffer overflow when tipc_crypto_msg_rcv(l->net, skb) is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a size validation check for MSG_CRYPTO messages to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Consider using a safer function to handle MSG_CRYPTO messages, such as one that uses a buffer with a fixed size.
3. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of MSG_CRYPTO messages to prevent buffer overflows. 4. Consider using a safer function to handle MSG_CRYPTO messages, such as one that uses a buffer with a fixed size. 5. Implement a mechanism to limit the size of MSG_CRYPTO messages to prevent buffer overflows. 6.
