 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2010-3850 vulnerability because it does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call. This allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and configure econet addresses.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before allowing the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
2. Use the capability check to ensure that the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is present before allowing the ioctl call. This can be done by using the capable function and checking if the capability is present. For example: if (capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)) {... }.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate function to handle the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call and requiring the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in that function. This can help to isolate the vulnerability and make it easier to fix.
