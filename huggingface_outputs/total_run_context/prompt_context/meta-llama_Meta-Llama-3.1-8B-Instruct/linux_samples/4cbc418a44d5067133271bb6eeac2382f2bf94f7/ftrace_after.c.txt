 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow a process in the guest kernel to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. The code appears to be related to function graph tracer functionality and does not involve any PV TLB (Page-Table Level Translation) operations that could potentially lead to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is properly secured. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the Linux kernel and guest kernel up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.
