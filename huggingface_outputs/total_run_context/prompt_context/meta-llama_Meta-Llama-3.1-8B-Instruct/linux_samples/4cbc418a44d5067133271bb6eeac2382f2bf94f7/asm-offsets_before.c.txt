 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that would allow a process in the guest kernel to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. The code appears to be a simple macro definition and a function return statement, which does not involve any memory access or manipulation that could be related to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE description. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets the required security standards.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3016
CVE Description:
In a Linux KVM guest that has PV TLB enabled, a process in the guest kernel may be able to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. This problem is limit to the host running linux kernel 4.10 with a guest running linux kernel 4.16 or later. The problem mainly affects AMD processors but Intel CPUs cannot be ruled out.  Code Sample: 

int foo() {
	struct pt_regs regs;
	struct callee_regs callee;
	memset(&regs, 0, sizeof(regs));
	memset
