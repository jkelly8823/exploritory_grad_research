VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7529
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's handling of the AF_ALG socket type allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the alg_name parameter in the alg_create interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating an AF_ALG socket and passing a specially crafted alg_name parameter.

Code Sample:
int alg_create(struct alg_ctx *ctx
