RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2019-3016. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested and validated. Additionally, the code could benefit from some minor improvements, such as using more descriptive variable names and adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of code.  The use of magic numbers (e.g., "probe_wakeup") could also be improved by defining named constants.  However, these are minor suggestions and do not affect the overall security of the code.
