 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-3016 vulnerability because it allows a process in the guest kernel to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. This is due to the use of MAP_PRIVATE and PROT_EXEC flags in the protection_map array. The use of MAP_PRIVATE allows for private mappings, which can be used to read memory locations from other processes. The use of PROT_EXEC allows for executable mappings, which can be used to execute code in the context of another process.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the use of MAP_PRIVATE flag in the protection_map array.
2. Remove the use of PROT_EXEC flag in the protection_map array.
3. Use MAP_SHARED flag instead of MAP_PRIVATE to ensure that all processes in the guest kernel share the same memory mappings.
4. Use a different protection flag that does not allow for executable mappings, such as PROT_READ or PROT_WRITE. 
5. Consider using a different memory mapping mechanism that does not allow for private mappings, such as using a shared memory region. 
6. Ensure that the host running the guest kernel is running a version of the Linux kernel that is not vulnerable to
