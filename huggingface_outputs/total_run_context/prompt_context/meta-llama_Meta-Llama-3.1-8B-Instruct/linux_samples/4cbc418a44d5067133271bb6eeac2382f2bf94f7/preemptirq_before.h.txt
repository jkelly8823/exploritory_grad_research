 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-3016. The vulnerability is related to a Linux KVM guest with PV TLB enabled, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a Linux kernel tracepoint that is used to track the caller and parent of a function call. The use of the _stext symbol and the calculation of offsets suggests that this code is intended to provide information about the location of function calls, rather than to access memory locations in a way that would be vulnerable to CVE-2019-3016.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2019-3016. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is not vulnerable to other potential issues. A review of the code may reveal other potential issues that should be addressed.
