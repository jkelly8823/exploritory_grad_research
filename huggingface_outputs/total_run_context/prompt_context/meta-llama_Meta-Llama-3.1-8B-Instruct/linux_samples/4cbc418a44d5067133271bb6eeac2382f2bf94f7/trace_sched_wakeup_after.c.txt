 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential information disclosure vulnerability. The printk(KERN_ERR "failed to start wakeup tracer\n"); statement is printing sensitive information to the kernel log. This information could potentially be accessed by an attacker, allowing them to gain insight into the system's internal workings.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the printk statement with a more secure logging mechanism, such as using the kernel's logging API to log the error message at a lower severity level.
2. Consider using a secure logging mechanism that does not print sensitive information to the kernel log. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all sensitive information is properly sanitized and not printed to the kernel log.  ```bash
```bash
