VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's handling of the AF_ALG socket type can lead to a use-after-free error when the kernel attempts to access the socket's protocol information after it has been freed. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Code Sample:
struct sk_buff *skb = dev_alloc_skb(1024);
if (!skb)
    return -ENOMEM;
skb->sk = sk;
skb->protocol = htons(ETH_P_IP);
skb
