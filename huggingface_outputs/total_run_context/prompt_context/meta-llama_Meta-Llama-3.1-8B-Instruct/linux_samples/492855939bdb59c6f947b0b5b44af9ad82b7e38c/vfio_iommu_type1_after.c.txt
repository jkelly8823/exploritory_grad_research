EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-3882 because it does not properly enforce the user's locked memory limit. The `dma_entry_limit` parameter is set to 65535, but the code does not check if the user has exceeded this limit when allocating DMA mappings. Additionally, the `dma_avail` counter is not properly updated when a DMA mapping is unlinked, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the user has not exceeded the `dma_entry_limit` when allocating DMA mappings.
2. Update the `dma_avail` counter when a DMA mapping is unlinked to prevent a denial of service (DoS) attack.
3. Consider implementing a more robust memory management system to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
