 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to Spectre v2 attacks due to the lack of indirect branch prediction barrier (IBPB) after running L2 code. The code checks if the buddy VMCS is different from the previous one, and if so, it executes an indirect branch prediction barrier. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent Spectre v2 attacks, as an attacker at L2 can still execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Upgrade to Kernel 6.2 or past commit 2e7eab81425a to fix the vulnerability. Alternatively, add an IBPB after running L2 code to prevent Spectre v2 attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-2196
CVE Description:
A regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed for speculative execution attacks. L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks on L1 due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after running L2 due to KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An attacker at
