 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-2196 vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly flush the indirect branch predictors when transitioning from L2 to L1, even though IBRS is advertised to the vCPU. This allows an attacker at L2 to execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to Kernel 6.2 or past commit 2e7eab81425a to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper indirect branch predictor flushing when transitioning from L2 to L1, even if IBRS is advertised to the vCPU. This can be done by adding a call to `indirect_branch_prediction_barrier()` before updating the VMCS fields. The corrected code would look like this:
```c
if (guest_cpuid_has(vcpu, X86_FEATURE_SPEC_CTRL))
	indirect_branch_prediction_barrier();

/* Update any VMCS fields that might have changed while L2 ran */
vmcs_write32(VM_EXIT_MSR_LOAD_COUNT, vmx->msr_autoload.host.nr);
