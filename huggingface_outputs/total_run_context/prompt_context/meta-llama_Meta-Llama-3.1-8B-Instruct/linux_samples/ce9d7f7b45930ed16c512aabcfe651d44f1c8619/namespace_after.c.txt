 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (mount-tree loop) due to the pivot_root implementation not properly interacting with certain locations of a chroot directory. This is because the code does not check for. (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call. The lines 6-7 are vulnerable because they do not check for the. (dot) values in the old_mnt and new_mnt paths.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for. (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the new_mnt and old_mnt paths are not. (dot) values.
3. Use a more secure method to interact with the chroot directory, such as using the chroot system call with the CHROOT_DETACH flag. 
4. Update the pivot_root implementation to properly handle. (dot) values in both arguments.  ```c
if (old_mnt == new_mnt || old_mnt == root_mnt) {
    printk(KERN_ERR "pivot_root: old_mnt and new_mnt cannot be the same\n");
    return
