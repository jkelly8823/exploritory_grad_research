 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The pivot_root system call is being used in this code. The pivot_root system call is vulnerable to CVE-2014-7970, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop) via. (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call. This is because the pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2014-7970.
2. Avoid using the pivot_root system call with. (dot) values in both arguments.
3. Use a secure alternative to pivot_root, such as pivot_root with a secure path. 
4. Implement additional security measures to prevent denial of service attacks.  ```
