 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service and system crash due to an out-of-bound access in the ext4_get_group_info function. This is because the memset function is used to clear the i_block and i_data fields of the ext4_raw_inode structure, but the size of the memset operation is not checked against the actual size of the fields. If the fields are larger than EXT4_MIN_INLINE_DATA_SIZE, the memset operation will access memory outside the bounds of the fields, leading to a denial of service and system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the size of the i_block and i_data fields before clearing them with memset.
2. Use a safer function, such as memset_s, to clear the fields.
3. Consider using a more secure way to clear the fields, such as using a loop to clear each byte individually.
