 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-10881 because it does not properly check the bounds of the i_block array when initializing it with zeros. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access when the ext4 filesystem is mounted and operated on a crafted image.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a bounds check before initializing the i_block array to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed size.
2. Consider using a safer function like memset_s to initialize the array, which can help prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 
3. Review the ext4 filesystem code to ensure that it properly handles crafted filesystem images and prevents out-of-bounds access.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-10881
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound access in ext4_get_group_info function, a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.  Code Sample: 

if (ext4_has_feature_extents(inode->i_sb)) {
	if (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode
