 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 20-22, 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a system crash due to a missing check in the CAN drivers. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be applied to the can_dlc field, which can be manipulated by a privileged user to make the data length code a higher value than the available CAN frame data size. This can cause the CAN drivers to write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the can_dlc value does not exceed the available CAN frame data size.
2. Implement a mechanism to prevent a privileged user from creating a CAN frame modification rule that can manipulate the can_dlc field.
3. Consider adding a bounds check for the frag_list pointer in skb_shared_info to prevent arbitrary content from being written to the CAN controller's I/O memory.
