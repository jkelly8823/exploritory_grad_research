 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the vulnerable code. The vulnerable code is located in the Linux Kernel, version 3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID' ioctl(2) request. The provided code sample does not contain this specific ioctl(2) request and therefore does not contain the vulnerable code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the vulnerable code and therefore does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to review the Linux Kernel code for the specific version range to ensure that the vulnerability is patched.  The code sample does contain a check for out-of-bounds memory access, but it is not related to the CVE-2019-19332 vulnerability.  The check is located in the line 'if (WARN_ON(*nent >= maxnent))' and it is a valid check to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.  However, it is not related to the CVE-2019-19332 vulnerability.  The code sample also contains a call to 'do_host_cpuid(entry, function
