 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-21823 due to the potential for insecure de-synchronization in Intel(R) DSA and Intel(R) IAA for some Intel(R) 4th or 5th generation Xeon(R) processors. This vulnerability may allow an authorized user to potentially enable escalation of privilege local access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Intel(R) DSA and Intel(R) IAA firmware to the latest version.
2. Implement additional synchronization mechanisms to prevent de-synchronization attacks.
3. Use secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
