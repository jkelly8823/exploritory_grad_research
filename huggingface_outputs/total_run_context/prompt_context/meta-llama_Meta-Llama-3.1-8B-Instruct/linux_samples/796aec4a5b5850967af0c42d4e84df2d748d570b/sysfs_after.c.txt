EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a hardware logic vulnerability in Intel(R) DSA and Intel(R) IAA for some Intel(R) 4th or 5th generation Xeon(R) processors. This vulnerability may allow an authorized user to potentially enable escalation of privilege local access. The code is using the `op_cap_show_common` function which is not safe for direct user submissions on certain systems. The function is clearing the BATCH capability from the capability mask in sysfs, but it is not properly handling the `user_submission_safe` flag. This can lead to a vulnerability in the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the `user_submission_safe` flag before calling the `op_cap_show_common` function.
2. Use a secure method to handle the capability mask in sysfs.
3. Consider using a different function that is safe for direct user submissions.
4. Update the code to properly handle the `user_submission_safe` flag and the capability mask in sys
