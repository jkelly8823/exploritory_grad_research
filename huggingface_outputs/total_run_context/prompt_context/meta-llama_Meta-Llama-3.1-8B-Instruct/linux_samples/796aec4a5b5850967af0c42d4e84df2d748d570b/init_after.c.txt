 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2024-21823 due to the use of insecure de-synchronization in Intel(R) DSA and Intel(R) IAA for some Intel(R) 4th or 5th generation Xeon(R) processors. The `user_submission_safe` flag is set to `false` in the code, which indicates that the user submission is not safe. This is a known vulnerability that can allow an authorized user to potentially enable escalation of privilege local access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use secure de-synchronization mechanisms for Intel(R) DSA and Intel(R) IAA.
2. Set the `user_submission_safe` flag to `true` to ensure that user submissions are safe.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent escalation of privilege local access.
