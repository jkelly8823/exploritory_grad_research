 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of mutex_lock and mutex_unlock in a loop. This can cause a deadlock if the mutex is not properly released before the loop exits. The code also does not check if the mutex is already locked before attempting to lock it, which can cause a deadlock if the mutex is already locked by another thread.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a spinlock instead of a mutex to avoid the possibility of a deadlock.
2. Check if the mutex is already locked before attempting to lock it.
3. Use a lock-free data structure to avoid the need for mutexes altogether. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0196
CVE Description:
The n_tty_write function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access in the "LECHO &!OPOST" case, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or gain privileges by triggering a race condition involving read and write operations with long strings.  The code sample provided is vulnerable
