 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26145 vulnerability. This is because the code accepts second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and processes them as full unfragmented frames. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration. The specific lines that are vulnerable are lines 9-10, where the code checks if the fragment is encrypted and then processes it if it is not. This is a problem because it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary packets even if they are not encrypted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the encryption status of the fragment before processing it. This can be done by checking the `HTT_RX_DESC_HL_INFO_ENCRYPTED` bit in the `rx_desc_info` field.
2. If the fragment is not encrypted, do not process it. Instead, discard it and return an error.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as checking the source MAC address of the fragment to ensure it is from a trusted device.
