 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26145 vulnerability. The issue arises from the fact that the code accepts second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and processes them as full unfragmented frames. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration. The specific lines that are vulnerable are 7-8, where the code checks if the frame is encrypted and then proceeds to process the frame if it's not encrypted. This is a direct match for the vulnerability description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the frame is fully encrypted before processing it. This can be done by verifying that the frame control field indicates that the frame is encrypted.
2. Implement a mechanism to discard second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments, even if they are sent in plaintext. This can be done by keeping track of the fragments that have been received and discarding any subsequent fragments that are not part of the original frame.
3. Consider implementing a more robust authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the network. This can include using WPA3 or other more secure authentication protocols.  VULNER
