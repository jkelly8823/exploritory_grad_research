 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-5207 vulnerability. The issue arises from the fact that the code does not properly restrict clearing MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC and changing MNT_ATIME_MASK during a remount of a bind mount. This allows local users to gain privileges, interfere with backups and auditing on systems that had atime enabled, or cause a denial of service (excessive filesystem updating) on systems that had atime disabled via a "mount -o remount" command within a user namespace.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC flags are properly restricted during a remount of a bind mount.
2. Implement proper checks to prevent changing MNT_ATIME_MASK during a remount of a bind mount.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle user namespaces and remount operations. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it adheres to the latest security best practices.  ```python
