 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-5207 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict the clearing of MNT_NOSUID during a remount of a bind mount. The line `if (bprm->file->f_path.mnt->mnt_flags & MNT_NOSUID) return;` checks if MNT_NOSUID is set, but it does not prevent the clearing of this flag. Additionally, the line `bprm->cred->euid = current_euid();` and `bprm->cred->egid = current_egid();` can be used to bypass the MNT_NOSUID restriction by setting the effective user ID and group ID to the current user ID and group ID, respectively.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that MNT_NOSUID is not cleared during a remount of a bind mount.
2. Use the `cred_alloc_blank` function to allocate a new credential structure for the new process, instead of reusing the existing credential structure.
3. Set the `no_new_privs` flag on the new process to prevent it from gaining new privileges.
