 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-5207 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict clearing MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC and changing MNT_ATIME_MASK during a remount of a bind mount. The code checks if the file may be suid, but it does not check if the mount point is a bind mount, which is a necessary condition for this vulnerability to occur. Additionally, the code checks if the current process is in the user namespace of the mount point, but this check is redundant and does not prevent the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the mount point is a bind mount before allowing the remount operation.
2. Remove the redundant check for the user namespace and replace it with a check for the mount point being a bind mount.
3. Consider adding additional checks to ensure that the MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC flags are not cleared during a remount operation. 
4. Consider adding a check to ensure that the MNT_ATIME_MASK flag is not changed during a remount operation.
