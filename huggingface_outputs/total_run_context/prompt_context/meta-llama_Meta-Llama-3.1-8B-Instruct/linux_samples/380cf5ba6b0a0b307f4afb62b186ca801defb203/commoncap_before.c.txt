 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-5207 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict clearing MNT_NODEV, MNT_NOSUID, and MNT_NOEXEC and changing MNT_ATIME_MASK during a remount of a bind mount. The code checks if MNT_NOSUID is set, but it does not check if MNT_NODEV or MNT_NOEXEC is set. This allows an attacker to clear these flags and gain privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for MNT_NODEV and MNT_NOEXEC flags in addition to MNT_NOSUID.
2. Ensure that the MNT_ATIME_MASK flag is not changed during a remount of a bind mount.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle file capabilities and mount flags.
