VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel before 4.12.4, a race condition in the netfilter nf_tables (NFT) implementation allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or gain privileges by manipulating the netfilter rules during the nftables init process.

	struct nft_set *set = nft_set_get_byid(nft, id);
	if (!set)
		return -ENOENT;
