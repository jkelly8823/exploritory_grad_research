 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. The current_euid() and current_egid() functions return the current user's effective user ID and group ID, respectively. However, the code does not properly validate these values before assigning them to bprm->cred->euid and bprm->cred->egid. This allows an attacker to manipulate the values and gain elevated privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the values returned by current_euid() and current_egid() before assigning them to bprm->cred->euid and bprm->cred->egid.
2. Use the get_current_euid() and get_current_egid() functions instead, which return the current user's effective user ID and group ID, respectively, and are more secure.
3. Consider using a more secure method to determine the user's credentials, such as using the getuid() and getgid() functions.
