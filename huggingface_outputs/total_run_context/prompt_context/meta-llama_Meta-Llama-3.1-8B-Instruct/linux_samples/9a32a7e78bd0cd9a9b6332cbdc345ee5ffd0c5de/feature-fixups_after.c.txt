 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a local user obtaining sensitive information from the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. This is due to the use of the `PTRRELOC` macro, which may allow a local user to access sensitive data in the L1 cache. The `PTRRELOC` macro is used to relocate the start and end addresses of the `__start___uaccess_flush_fixup` and `__stop___uaccess_flush_fixup` symbols, which may contain sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the `PTRRELOC` macro to access sensitive data in the L1 cache.
2. Use a secure relocation mechanism, such as the `kasan` kernel address sanitizer, to prevent local users from accessing sensitive data in the L1 cache.
3. Consider using a different approach to implement the `do_uaccess_flush_fixups` function, such as using a secure memory region or a different instruction set architecture.
