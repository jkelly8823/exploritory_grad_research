 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability because it enables the L1-D cache flush feature without proper consideration for the potential information disclosure. The feature is enabled by default, which could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the L1 cache under certain circumstances.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code and consider the potential risks associated with enabling the L1-D cache flush feature.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent information disclosure, such as using a secure cache flush mechanism.
3. Consider disabling the L1-D cache flush feature by default and only enabling it when necessary. This would require careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks of enabling the feature. 
4. Update the code to properly handle the L1-D cache flush feature and prevent potential information disclosure. This may involve adding additional checks or validation to ensure that the feature is only enabled when necessary. 5. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure cache flush function, to prevent information disclosure. 6. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and address them accordingly. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard, such as the
