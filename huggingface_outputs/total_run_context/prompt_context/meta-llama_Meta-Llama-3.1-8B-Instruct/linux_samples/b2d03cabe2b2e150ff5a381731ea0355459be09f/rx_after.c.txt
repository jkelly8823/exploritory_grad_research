 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any direct references to the WLAN frame injection vulnerability described in CVE-2022-42722. The code snippet is focused on handling beacon protection and key management within the mac80211 stack, but it does not involve injecting WLAN frames or manipulating the beacon protection of P2P devices in a way that would be susceptible to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is essential to ensure that the code is thoroughly reviewed and tested to guarantee its correctness and security. Regular updates and patches for the Linux kernel should also be applied to address any potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-42722
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel 5.8 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16, local attackers able to inject WLAN frames into the mac80211 stack could cause a NULL pointer dereference denial-of-service attack against the beacon protection of P2P devices.  Code Sample: 
int foo(int x) {
    int *ptr = NULL;
