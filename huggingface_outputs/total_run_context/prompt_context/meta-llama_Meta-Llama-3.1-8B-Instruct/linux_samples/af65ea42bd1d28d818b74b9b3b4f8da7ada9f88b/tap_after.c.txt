 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-41090 and CVE-2024-41091 vulnerabilities because it does not properly check the length of the frame before building the skb. Although the code checks if the frame length is less than ETH_HLEN, it does not account for the possibility of a corrupted skb being sent downstack. This is because the skb is built before the length is checked, and the skb metadata may be inconsistent or incorrect.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the length check before building the skb to ensure that the skb is not built with an invalid length.
2. Use the alternative path, tun_get_user() or tap_get_user(), which already prohibits short frames with lengths less than ETH_HLEN. This will prevent the corrupted skb from being sent downstack.
