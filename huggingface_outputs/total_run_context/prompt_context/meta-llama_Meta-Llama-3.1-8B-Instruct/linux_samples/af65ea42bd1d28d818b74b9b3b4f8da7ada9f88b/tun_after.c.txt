 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-41091 vulnerability. The code checks if the datasize is less than ETH_HLEN, but it does not check if the datasize is less than ETH_HLEN in the alternative path where tun_get_user() is used. This could cause a corrupted skb to be sent downstack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for datasize being less than ETH_HLEN in the alternative path where tun_get_user() is used.
2. Use a more robust way to check the validity of the frame length, such as using skb_is_gso() instead of relying on the gso->gso_type flag.
