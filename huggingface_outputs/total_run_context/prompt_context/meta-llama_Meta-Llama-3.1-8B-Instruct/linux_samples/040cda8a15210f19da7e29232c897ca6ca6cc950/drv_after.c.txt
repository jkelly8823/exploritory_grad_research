 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that could be exploited by the CVE-2019-14895 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to a heap-based buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's Marvell WiFi chip driver, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a conditional statement that sets a configuration variable based on the hardware revision and configuration type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it is secure and free from any potential vulnerabilities.  The code sample does not appear to be related to the Linux kernel or the Marvell WiFi chip driver, so it is unlikely to be affected by this vulnerability.  However, it is always a good idea to keep up to date with the latest security patches and updates for any software or hardware components used in the system.  Additionally, consider implementing secure coding practices, such as input validation and error handling, to help prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future.  Consider using a static analysis tool to review the code and identify any potential security issues.
