 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of the udelay function. The udelay function introduces a delay of 20 microseconds, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow. This is because the udelay function can be used to manipulate the timing of the code execution, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the udelay function with a more secure alternative, such as the usleep function.
2. Use a more secure method to introduce delays in the code, such as using a timer or a scheduling mechanism.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a buffer overflow protection mechanism, to prevent buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-14895
CVE Description:
A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux kernel, all versions 3.x.x and 4.x.x before 4.18.0, in Marvell WiFi chip driver. The flaw could occur when the station attempts a connection negotiation during the handling of the remote devices country settings. This could allow the
