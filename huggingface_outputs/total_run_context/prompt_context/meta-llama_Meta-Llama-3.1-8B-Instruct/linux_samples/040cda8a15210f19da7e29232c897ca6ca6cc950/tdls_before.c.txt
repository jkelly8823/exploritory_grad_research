 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data from the `pos` array to the `sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates` array. Specifically, the lines 14-15 are vulnerable because they do not check if the `pos[1]` value is within the valid range of the `sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates` array. If the `pos[1]` value is larger than the size of the `sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates` array, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to ensure that the `pos[1]` value is within the valid range of the `sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates` array.
2. Consider using a safer function like `memcpy_s` to copy data from the `pos` array to the `sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates` array.
3. Review the code to ensure that all potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities are addressed.
