RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2019-14895. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and follow secure coding practices.  The code could benefit from additional error checking and handling to ensure robustness.  Additionally, the use of magic numbers (e.g. 20 in the udelay function) could be replaced with named constants for better readability and maintainability.  It would also be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of each function and the logic behind the code.  Finally, the code could benefit from additional testing to ensure it is working as expected.  It is also a good practice to follow the secure coding guidelines and best practices for the specific programming language and framework being used.  The code could also benefit from code reviews to catch any potential issues before they become
