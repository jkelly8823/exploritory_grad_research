 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 due to the use of indirect branch prediction in the macro get_host_ctxt. This macro is used to retrieve the host context, which can potentially allow an attacker with local user access to disclose information via a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the indirect branch prediction with a direct branch prediction.
2. Use a secure method to retrieve the host context, such as using a secure function or a hardware-based solution.
3. Consider using a compiler flag or a compiler-specific option to disable speculative execution. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.  CVE_ID:CVE-2019-1125
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. The vulnerability allows a guest user to crash the host system by sending a malicious SMM (System Management Mode) request to the host.  CVE_ID:C
