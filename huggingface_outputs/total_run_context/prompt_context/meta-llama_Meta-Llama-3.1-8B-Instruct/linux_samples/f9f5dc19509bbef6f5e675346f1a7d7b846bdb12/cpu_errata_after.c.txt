 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 because it uses speculative execution and indirect branch prediction, which can allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis. The code is designed to mitigate this vulnerability by using a branch predictor hardening mechanism, but it does not properly handle the case where the branch predictor is not properly initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the branch predictor properly before using it.
2. Use a more secure branch prediction mechanism, such as a branch predictor that uses a secure hash function.
3. Consider using a hardware-based solution to mitigate the vulnerability, such as a branch predictor that is designed to be secure by default.
