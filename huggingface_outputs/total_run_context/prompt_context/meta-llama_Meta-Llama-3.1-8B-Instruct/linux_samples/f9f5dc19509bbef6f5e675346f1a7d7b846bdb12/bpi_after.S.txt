VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5715 vulnerability, which is a variant of the Spectre attack. This vulnerability occurs when the CPU uses speculative execution to predict the outcome of a branch instruction, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive information. The code snippet uses the `stp` instruction to store registers on the stack, which can be used to bypass branch predictor defenses. This is a specific example of how the Spectre attack can be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a different instruction that does not rely on speculative execution, such as `str` or `ldr`. Additionally, the use of stack-based storage should be avoided in favor of register-based storage. This can be achieved by reordering the instructions to minimize the use of speculative execution. For example:
```assembly
.macro smccc_workaround_1 inst
	sub	sp, sp, #(8 * 4)
	str	x2, [sp, #(8 * 0)]
	str	x3, [sp, #(8 * 4)]
	str	x0, [sp, #(8 * 8)]
	str	x
