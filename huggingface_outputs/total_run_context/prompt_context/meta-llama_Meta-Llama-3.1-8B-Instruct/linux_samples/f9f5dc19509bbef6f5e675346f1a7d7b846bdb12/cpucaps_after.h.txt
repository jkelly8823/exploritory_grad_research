 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a set of macro definitions for ARM64 architecture capabilities. The code does not contain any direct implementation of speculative execution or indirect branch prediction, which are the primary concerns of the CVE-2017-5715 vulnerability. The code is simply defining constants for different capabilities, and does not contain any executable code that could be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and follow secure coding guidelines to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  The unused capability macro is commented out, which is a good practice to prevent potential issues. Consider removing the commented out macro to declutter the code.  Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each capability macro.  Consider using a more descriptive naming convention for the macros to improve code readability.  Consider using a consistent naming convention throughout the code.  Consider using a code review process to ensure the code meets the required security standards.  Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.  Consider using a secure coding
