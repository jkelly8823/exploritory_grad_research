 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly implements the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL. The functions provided are related to file space preallocation and hole punching, but they do not appear to be related to the specific vulnerability described in CVE-2021-4155.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security issues. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4155
CVE Description:
A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.  Code Sample: 
int xfs_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg) 
{ 
    switch (cmd) 
    {
