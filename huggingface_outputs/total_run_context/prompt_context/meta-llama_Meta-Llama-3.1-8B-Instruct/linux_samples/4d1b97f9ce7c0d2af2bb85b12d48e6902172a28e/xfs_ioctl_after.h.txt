EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly interacts with the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL. The function xfs_ioc_swapext() appears to be related to swapping file extents, but there is no indication that it is used to increase the size of files with unaligned size. Therefore, it is unlikely that this code is vulnerable to the CVE-2021-4155 data leak flaw.
