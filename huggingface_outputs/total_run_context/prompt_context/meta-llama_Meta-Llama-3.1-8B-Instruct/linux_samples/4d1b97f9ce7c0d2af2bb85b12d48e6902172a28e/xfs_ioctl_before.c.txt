 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a data leak flaw due to the way it handles the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL. The issue arises when the size increase of files with unaligned size is allowed, which can lead to data leakage on the XFS filesystem. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2021-4155) that can be exploited by a local attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size increase request to ensure it is aligned.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent unaligned size increases.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle file size increases, such as using a secure allocation algorithm.

CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4155
CVE Description:
A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.  VULNERABLE: YES
