 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a data leak flaw due to the way it handles the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL. The flaw is present in the xfs_compat_flock64_copyin function where it does not properly handle unaligned size increases of files. This allows a local attacker to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the xfs_compat_flock64_copyin function to properly handle unaligned size increases of files.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the size increase is properly aligned.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle file size increases, such as using a secure copy function.

CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4155
CVE Description:
A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.  ```bash
