 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a data leak flaw due to the way it handles file space allocation. The xfs_alloc_file_space function is called with the XFS_BMAPI_PREALLOC flag, which allows for size increase of files with unaligned size. This can lead to a data leak if a local attacker can manipulate the file size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that file space allocation is done in a way that prevents data leaks. This can be achieved by using the XFS_BMAPI_REALLOCATE flag instead of XFS_BMAPI_PREALLOC, which will prevent the file size from being increased with unaligned size. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles file size changes to prevent data leaks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4155
CVE Description:
A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.
