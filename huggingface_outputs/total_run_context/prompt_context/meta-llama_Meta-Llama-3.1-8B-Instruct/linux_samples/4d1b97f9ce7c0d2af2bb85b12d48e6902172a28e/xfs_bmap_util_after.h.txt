 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly interacts with the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL. The functions provided are related to preallocation and hole punch interface, but they do not appear to be related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-4155.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is not using any deprecated or vulnerable functions. Additionally, consider using a code review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4155
CVE Description:
A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.  Code Sample: 
int xfs_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg) 
{ 
    switch (cmd) 
    { 
        case XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP:
