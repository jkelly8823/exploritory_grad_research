 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a data leak flaw due to the way it handles file space allocation. The xfs_alloc_file_space function is called with the offset and length parameters, which can potentially lead to an unaligned size increase of files. This can result in data being leaked on the XFS filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the file size is aligned before calling xfs_alloc_file_space. This can be achieved by using the xfs_is_always_cow_inode function to check if the inode is a copy-on-write inode, and if so, use a different allocation function that ensures aligned size increases. Alternatively, the code can use the xfs_alloc_file_space function with the XFS_ALLOC_FSP_ALIGNED flag to ensure that the file size is aligned. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4155
CVE Description:
A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise
