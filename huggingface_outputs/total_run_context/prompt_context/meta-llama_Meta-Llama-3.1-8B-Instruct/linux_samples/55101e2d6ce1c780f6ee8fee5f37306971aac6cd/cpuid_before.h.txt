 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The ioapic_deliver function and kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic return value are not present in this code. The code is checking for the presence of the SMEP feature using the cpuid instruction, which is a different functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues related to the cpuid instruction and its usage. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly tested and validated to prevent any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0155
CVE Description:
The ioapic_deliver function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not properly validate the kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic return value, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted entry in the redirection table of an I/O APIC.  NOTE: the affected code was moved to the ioapic_service function before the vulnerability was announced.
