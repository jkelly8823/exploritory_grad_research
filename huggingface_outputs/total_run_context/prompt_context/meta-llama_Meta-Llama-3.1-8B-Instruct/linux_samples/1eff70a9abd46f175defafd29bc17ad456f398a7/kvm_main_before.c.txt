 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-3016 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly check for the PV TLB enabled status of the guest kernel. In lines 14-15, the code checks if the map is NULL, but it does not check if the PV TLB is enabled. This allows a process in the guest kernel to read memory locations from another process in the same guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the PV TLB is disabled before allowing the map operation.
2. Update the code to properly handle the PV TLB enabled status of the guest kernel.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle memory mapping, such as using a separate memory mapping mechanism that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3016
CVE Description:
In a Linux KVM guest that has PV TLB enabled, a process in the guest kernel may be able to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. This problem is limit to the host running linux kernel 4.10 with a guest running linux kernel
