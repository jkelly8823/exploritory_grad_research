 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks the length of the replay counter and KEK attributes before proceeding. This prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure against the CVE-2017-12153 vulnerability.  The checks for the length of the replay counter and KEK attributes are present and correct.  However, it would be beneficial to add additional error checking to ensure that the required attributes are present in the Netlink request.  This could be achieved by checking the presence of the attributes before checking their length.  For example: if (!nla_ok(tb[NL80211_REKEY_DATA_REPLAY_CTR])) return -EINVAL;  This would prevent the function from crashing if the required attributes are missing.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to add a check to ensure that the user has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before proceeding.  This could be achieved by using the capabilities function: if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)) return -EPERM;  This would prevent unauthorized users from issuing the Netlink request.  However, these additional checks are not necessary to prevent the CVE-2017-12153 vulnerability
