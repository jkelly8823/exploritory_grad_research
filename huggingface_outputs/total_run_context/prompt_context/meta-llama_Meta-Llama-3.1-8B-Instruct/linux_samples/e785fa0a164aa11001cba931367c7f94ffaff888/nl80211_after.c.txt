 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for the presence of required attributes before proceeding. It also checks the length of the attributes to prevent potential buffer overflows. This suggests that the code is designed to prevent the vulnerability described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest security patches.  The code could also benefit from additional checks to ensure that the attributes are valid and not malicious.  Additionally, consider using a more secure method to handle the attributes, such as using a secure data structure or a library that provides secure attribute handling.  Finally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to further protect against potential vulnerabilities.  Consider using a code review tool to identify potential issues and ensure that the code is secure.  Consider implementing a secure coding standard and following it to ensure that the code is secure.  Consider using a secure coding library to help identify potential issues and ensure that the code is secure.  Consider implementing a secure coding policy and following it to ensure that the code
