 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-1000253 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle the mapping of a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. The code attempts to map the binary into this address range without allocating sufficient space for the entire binary, which can lead to the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the area that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Allocate sufficient space for the entire binary before mapping it into the address range.
2. Use the `vm_mmap` function to map the binary into the address range, which takes into account the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary.
3. Disable the `CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE` configuration option to prevent the vulnerability.
