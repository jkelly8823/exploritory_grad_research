 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) due to the lack of proper validation of xattr sizes. The ext4_xattr_check_entries function does not validate the xattr sizes correctly, which can lead to misinterpretation of a size as an error code. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2018-1095.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the xattr sizes correctly by checking if the size is within the valid range before proceeding with the rest of the function.
2. Use a more robust validation mechanism to prevent misinterpretation of sizes as error codes.
3. Consider adding additional checks to prevent potential NULL pointer dereferences. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1095
CVE Description:
The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code, and consequently allows attackers to cause a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a
