 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) due to the lack of proper validation of xattr sizes. The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code. This vulnerability can be exploited by a crafted ext4 image.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the xattr size before processing it.
2. Use a safe function to convert the xattr size from CPU to host byte order.
3. Check for NULL pointer dereference before accessing the xattr value.

CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1095
CVE Description:
The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code, and consequently allows attackers to cause a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted
