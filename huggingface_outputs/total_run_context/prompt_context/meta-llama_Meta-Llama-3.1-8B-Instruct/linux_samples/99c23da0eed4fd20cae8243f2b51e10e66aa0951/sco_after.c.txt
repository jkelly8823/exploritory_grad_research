 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36, 44-46, 54-56
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The bug is triggered when the sco_conn_del() function is called while the sco_sock_sendmsg() function is still executing. This can cause the system to crash or escalate privileges.
The vulnerability is present in the sco_send_frame() function where it calls hci_send_sco() with a pointer to a struct sk_buff that may have already been freed. This is because the sco_conn_del() function can free the sk_buff before sco_send_frame() has a chance to finish executing.
The vulnerability is also present in the sco_sock_sendmsg() function where it calls memcpy_from_msg() with a pointer to a buffer that may have already been freed. This is because the sco_conn_del() function can free the buffer before sco_sock_sendmsg() has a chance to finish executing.
The vulnerability is also present in the sco_conn_defer_accept() function where it calls sco_send_frame() with a pointer to a struct sco_conn that may have already been freed. This is because the sco_conn_del() function can free the sco_conn before sco_conn_defer_accept
