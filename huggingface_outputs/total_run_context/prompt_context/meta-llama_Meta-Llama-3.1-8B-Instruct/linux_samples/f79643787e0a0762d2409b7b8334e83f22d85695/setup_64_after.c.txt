 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-4788 due to the lack of proper handling of the L1 cache. The `rfi_flush` variable is not properly initialized, which can lead to sensitive information being leaked from the L1 cache. This is a critical vulnerability that can be exploited by a local user.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the `rfi_flush` variable properly before using it.
2. Implement proper checks to ensure that the L1 cache is properly flushed before accessing sensitive information.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure flag or a secure function, to prevent sensitive information from being leaked.
