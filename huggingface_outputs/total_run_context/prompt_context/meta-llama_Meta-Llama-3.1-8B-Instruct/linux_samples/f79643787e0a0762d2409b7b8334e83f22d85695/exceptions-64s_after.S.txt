 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-8
EXPLANATION:
The code sample appears to be vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability. The code is accessing the L1 cache directly, which could potentially allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. The lines 1-8 contain the instructions that access the L1 cache, specifically the `ld` instructions that load data from the cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to avoid accessing the L1 cache directly. This could be achieved by using a cache-friendly data structure or by using a different approach that does not involve direct cache access. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a local user.
