 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability. This is because the 'no_entry_flush' option is enabled, which allows a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the 'no_entry_flush' option to prevent this vulnerability.
2. Consider enabling the 'tsx_async_abort' option to mitigate potential issues related to asynchronous aborts.
3. Regularly review and update the kernel configuration to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date.
