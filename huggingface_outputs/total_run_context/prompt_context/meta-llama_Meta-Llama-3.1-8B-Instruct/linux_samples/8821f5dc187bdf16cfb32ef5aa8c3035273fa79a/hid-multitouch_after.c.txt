 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to array index errors due to the lack of bounds checking in the HID_DG_CONTACTMAX and HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT cases. In the HID_DG_CONTACTMAX case, the code does not check if the field->index is within the bounds of the field->report->maxfield. In the HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT case, the code does not check if the field->index is within the bounds of the field->report->maxfield and usage->usage_index is within the bounds of field->report_count. This can lead to an array index error when accessing field->value[0] or field->report->maxfield.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking for field->index in the HID_DG_CONTACTMAX case.
2. Add bounds checking for field->index and usage->usage_index in the HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT case.
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the contact information. This would eliminate the need for manual bounds checking.
