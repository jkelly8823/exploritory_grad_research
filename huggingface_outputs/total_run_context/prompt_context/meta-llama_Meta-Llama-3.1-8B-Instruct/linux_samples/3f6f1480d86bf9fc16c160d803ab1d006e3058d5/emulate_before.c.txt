 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480 because it lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This allows a guest OS user to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add the missing decoder-table flags for RIP-relative instructions.
2. Review the code to ensure that all necessary flags are included for all instructions.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```python
