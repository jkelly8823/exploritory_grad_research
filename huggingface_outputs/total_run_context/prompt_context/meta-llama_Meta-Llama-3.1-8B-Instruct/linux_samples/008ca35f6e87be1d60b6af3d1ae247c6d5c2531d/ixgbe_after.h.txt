 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters. The code appears to be a part of a network driver for the ixgbevf adapter, which is a virtual function (VF) of the ixgbe adapter. The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-33061 is related to the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters, not the ixgbevf adapter. Therefore, the code sample is not vulnerable to this CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-33061. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to follow secure coding practices.
