 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the given CVE descriptions. The code appears to be a part of a graphics driver and is using specific workarounds for certain Intel processors. The code is using conditional compilation directives (HAS_POOLED_EU) to check for specific hardware features, which is a good practice to avoid enabling workarounds on unsupported hardware. The code also uses specific constants and macros (e.g., gen8_emit_flush_coherentl3_wa, gen8_emit_pipe_control) that are likely defined elsewhere in the codebase, which suggests a structured and organized approach to handling hardware-specific workarounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be well-structured and follows good practices for handling hardware-specific workarounds. However, it's always a good idea to review the code and ensure that the workarounds are still necessary and effective for the specific hardware and use cases. Additionally, consider using more modern and secure coding practices, such as using secure coding guidelines and regularly reviewing the code for potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
