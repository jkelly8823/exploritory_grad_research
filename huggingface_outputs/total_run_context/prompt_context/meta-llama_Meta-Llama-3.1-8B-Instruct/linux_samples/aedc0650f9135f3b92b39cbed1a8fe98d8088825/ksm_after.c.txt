 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds memory write issue due to the lack of bounds checking in the 'EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL' macro. This macro is used to export a symbol to other modules, but it does not perform any checks on the symbol being exported. In this case, the 'ksm_madvise' function is being exported without any checks, which could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds memory write issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the 'EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL' macro should be modified to include bounds checking to ensure that the symbol being exported is within the expected range. Additionally, the 'ksm_madvise' function should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any out-of-bounds memory access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-19332
CVE Description:
An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the Linux Kernel, version 3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID' ioctl(2) request to get CPUID
