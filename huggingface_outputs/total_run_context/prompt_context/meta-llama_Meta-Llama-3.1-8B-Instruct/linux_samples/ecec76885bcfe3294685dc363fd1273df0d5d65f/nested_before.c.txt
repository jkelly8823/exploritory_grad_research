 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Use-after-Free vulnerability. The variable vmx->nested.vmxon is set to false before the memory it points to is freed. This can lead to undefined behavior when the freed memory is accessed later.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the memory is freed before the variable is set to false.
2. Use a pointer to the memory location instead of the variable itself to avoid the use-after-free issue.
3. Consider using a smart pointer to manage the memory automatically. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-7221
CVE Description:
The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.20.5 has a Use-after-Free.  The code sample provided is vulnerable to this issue.  The free_vpid function is called before the vmx->nested.vmxon and vmx->nested.smm.vmxon variables are set to false.  This can lead to undefined behavior when the freed memory is accessed later.  The recommended fixes are to ensure that the memory is freed after the variables are set to false, or to use a smart pointer to manage the memory
