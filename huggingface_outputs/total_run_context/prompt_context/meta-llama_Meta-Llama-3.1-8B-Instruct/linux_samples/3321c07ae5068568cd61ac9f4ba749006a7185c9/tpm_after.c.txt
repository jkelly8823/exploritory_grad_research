 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the improper clearing of memory in the tpm_read function. The memset function is used to clear the memory, but it is not guaranteed to be executed if the copy_to_user function fails. This is because the memset function is placed after the copy_to_user function, and if the copy_to_user function fails, the memset function will not be executed. This allows the memory to remain uncleared, potentially allowing local users to read the results of the previous TPM command.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the memset function to before the copy_to_user function to ensure that the memory is cleared regardless of the outcome of the copy_to_user function.
2. Consider using a more robust method to clear the memory, such as using a secure erase function. 
3. Ensure that the mutex_lock and mutex_unlock functions are properly paired to prevent deadlocks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-1162
CVE Description:
The tpm_read function in the Linux kernel 2.6 does not properly clear memory, which might allow local users to read the results of the previous TPM command
