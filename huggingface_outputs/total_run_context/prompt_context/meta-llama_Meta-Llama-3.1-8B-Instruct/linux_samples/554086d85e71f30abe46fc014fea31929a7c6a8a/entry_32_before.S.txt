 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) due to an invalid syscall number. This is because the code does not properly handle syscall numbers greater than or equal to NR_syscalls. When syscall auditing is enabled and the sep CPU feature flag is set, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing an invalid syscall number, such as 1000, to the sys_call_table.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the syscall number is within the valid range before calling the sys_call_table.
2. Implement proper error handling for invalid syscall numbers to prevent a denial of service.
3. Consider disabling syscall auditing when the sep CPU feature flag is not set to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  ```bash
