 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as demonstrated by number 1000. This is due to the fact that the syscall auditing is enabled and the sep CPU feature flag is set. The code does not properly handle the case where the syscall number is invalid, leading to a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable syscall auditing when the sep CPU feature flag is not set.
2. Implement proper error handling for invalid syscall numbers.
3. Use a more robust method to handle syscall numbers, such as using a lookup table or a more secure method to determine the syscall number.
