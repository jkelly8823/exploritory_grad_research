 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-6951. The key_type_dead structure is defined with a name of ".dead", which is a valid key type. However, the keyring_search_aux function in the Linux kernel does not handle the ".dead" key type correctly, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference and OOPS when a request_key system call is made for this type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2017-6951.
2. Avoid using the ".dead" key type in the code.
3. If the ".dead" key type is necessary, add a custom implementation of the keyring_search_aux function to handle this key type correctly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-9604
CVE Description:
It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature
