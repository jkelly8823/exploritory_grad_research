 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-9604. This is because the install_thread_keyring_to_cred function does not check if the keyring is already present in the credentials struct before allocating a new one. This allows an attacker to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the keyring is already present in the credentials struct before allocating a new one. This can be done by checking the new->thread_keyring pointer before calling keyring_alloc. If the pointer is not NULL, then the function should return 0 without allocating a new keyring.
