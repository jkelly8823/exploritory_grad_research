EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-9604. The install_thread_keyring_to_cred function allocates a new keyring with KEY_ALLOC_QUOTA_OVERRUN, which allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the KEY_ALLOC_QUOTA_OVERRUN flag when allocating the keyring in install_thread_keyring_to_cred.
