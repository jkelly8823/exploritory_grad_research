 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-9604. The keyctl_join_session_keyring function allows root to gain direct access to an internal keyring by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  The keyctl_join_session_keyring function should be modified to check the permissions of the keyring before joining it.
2.  The keyctl_join_session_keyring function should be modified to prevent root from joining internal keyrings.
3.  The keyctl_join_session_keyring function should be modified to add additional checks to prevent unauthorized access to internal keyrings.
