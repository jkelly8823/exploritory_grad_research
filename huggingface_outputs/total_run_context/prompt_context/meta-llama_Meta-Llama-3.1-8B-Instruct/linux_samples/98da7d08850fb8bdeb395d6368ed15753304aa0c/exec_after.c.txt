VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack overflow attack. The size of the stack is calculated by adding the size of the pointers to the strings, but this calculation is not sufficient to prevent a stack overflow. The size of the pointers is calculated as (bprm->argc + bprm->envc) * sizeof(void *), but this does not take into account the size of the strings themselves. As a result, the stack size calculation is not accurate, and a stack overflow can occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Recalculate the stack size by adding the size of the strings to the size of the pointers.
2. Use a more accurate method to calculate the stack size, such as using the `strnlen` function to get the length of the strings.
3. Implement a stack overflow protection mechanism, such as using a canary value or a stack guard page.

CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000365
CVE Description:
The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not take
