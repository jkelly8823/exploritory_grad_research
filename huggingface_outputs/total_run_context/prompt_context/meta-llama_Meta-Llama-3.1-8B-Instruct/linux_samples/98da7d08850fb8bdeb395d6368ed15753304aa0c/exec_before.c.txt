 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow attack. The size of the argument is calculated as the difference between the end and start of the virtual memory area (vm_end - vm_start). However, this does not take into account the size of the argument and environment pointers, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux Kernel, specifically CVE-2017-1000365.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux Kernel to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (version 4.11.6 or later).
2. Implement a more accurate calculation of the argument size, taking into account the size of the argument and environment pointers.
3. Use a safer method to handle the argument size, such as using a buffer with a fixed size and checking for overflow before writing to it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000365
CVE Description:
The Linux Kernel imposes a size restriction on the arguments and environmental strings passed through RLIMIT_STACK/RLIM_INFINITY (1/4 of the size), but does not take the argument and environment pointers into
