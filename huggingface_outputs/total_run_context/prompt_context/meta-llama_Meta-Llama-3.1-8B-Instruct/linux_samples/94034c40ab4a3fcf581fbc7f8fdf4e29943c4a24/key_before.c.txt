 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24587 because it does not check if the key is being periodically renewed before replacing it. This allows an adversary to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the key is being periodically renewed before replacing it.
2. Clear the received fragments from memory after (re)connecting to a network to prevent CVE-2020-24586. 
3. Ensure that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. 
4. Use secure encryption protocols like WPA3. 
5. Regularly update the encryption keys to prevent key reuse. 
6. Implement secure key management practices. 
7. Use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like this.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24587
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a
