 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24587 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly clear the received fragments from memory after reconnecting to a network. The line `memcpy(entry->last_pn, rx->key->u.ccmp.rx_pn[queue], IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN);` copies the received PN value into the `last_pn` field of the `entry` struct, which is not cleared when the network is reconnected. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clear the `last_pn` field of the `entry` struct when the network is reconnected.
2. Use a secure method to store and manage the PN values, such as using a secure hash function to store the PN values and comparing the stored values with the received PN values. This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrating user data.
