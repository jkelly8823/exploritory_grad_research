 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24587 and CVE-2020-24586 because it does not properly clear received fragments from memory after reconnecting to a network. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clear the `last_pn` array after reconnecting to a network.
2. Ensure that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key.
3. Implement a secure method to handle fragmented frames, such as using a secure encryption protocol like AES. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24587
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
