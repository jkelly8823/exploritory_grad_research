 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24587 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly clear the received fragments from memory after reconnecting to a network. The line `memcpy(entry->last_pn, rx->key->u.ccmp.rx_pn[queue], IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN);` stores the received PN value in the `entry->last_pn` variable, which is not cleared after reconnecting. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clear the `entry->last_pn` variable after reconnecting to a network.
2. Use a secure method to store and manage the received PN values. 
3. Implement a secure key management system to prevent unauthorized access to the network.
