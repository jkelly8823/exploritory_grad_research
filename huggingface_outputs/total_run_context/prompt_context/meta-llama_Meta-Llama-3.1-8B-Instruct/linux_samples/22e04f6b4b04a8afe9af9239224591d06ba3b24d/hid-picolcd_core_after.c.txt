 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The line "buf += 10;" increments the buffer pointer by a fixed value of 10, regardless of the actual size of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not large enough to accommodate the increment. Additionally, the line "cnt -= 10;" decrements the counter by a fixed value of 10, which can also lead to a buffer overflow if the counter is not large enough to accommodate the decrement.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a dynamic buffer increment instead of a fixed value. For example, use "buf += strlen(buf);" to increment the buffer pointer by the actual length of the buffer.
2. Use a safe decrement operation instead of a fixed value. For example, use "cnt -= strlen(buf);" to decrement the counter by the actual length of the buffer.
3. Add bounds checking to ensure that the buffer and counter do not overflow.
4. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the buffer data.
