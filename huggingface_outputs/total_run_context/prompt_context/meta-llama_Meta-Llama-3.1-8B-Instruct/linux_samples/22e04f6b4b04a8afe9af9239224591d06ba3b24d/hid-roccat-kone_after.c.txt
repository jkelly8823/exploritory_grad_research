 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS due to the repeated call to hid_get_drvdata(dev_get_drvdata(dev)) on line 5 and 11. This is because the function dev_get_drvdata(dev) returns a pointer to a data structure, and calling dev_get_drvdata(dev) again on the returned pointer will result in a NULL pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the repeated call to hid_get_drvdata(dev_get_drvdata(dev)) on line 5 and 11.
2. Assign the result of dev_get_drvdata(dev) to a variable and reuse it instead of calling the function multiple times. This will prevent the NULL pointer dereference and OOPS. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2899
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-picolcd_core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_PICOLCD is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted device.
