 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for input device IDs. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the CVEs. The macros define constants for various input device ID ranges, but they do not involve any dynamic memory allocation, pointer dereferences, or other potential sources of vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet is safe and does not require any modifications. However, it is always a good practice to review and update macro definitions to ensure they are accurate and up-to-date. Additionally, consider using more descriptive names for the macros to improve code readability.
