 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function strict_strtoul() is used to convert a string to an unsigned long integer. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strtoul() that performs bounds checking on the input string.
2. Validate the input string length before passing it to the function.
3. Consider using a more secure function like sscanf() that allows for more control over the input string.
