 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-2896 due to the presence of HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS in the static HID quirks list. This quirk is associated with the NTRIG DUOSENSE device, which is known to be vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS when a crafted device is plugged in.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk from the static HID quirks list.
2. Consider adding a runtime check to ensure that the NTRIG DUOSENSE device is not used with the HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_REPORTS quirk.
3. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2013-2896.
