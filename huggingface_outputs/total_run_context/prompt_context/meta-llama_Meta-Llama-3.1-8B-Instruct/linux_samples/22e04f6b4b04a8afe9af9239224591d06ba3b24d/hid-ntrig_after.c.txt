 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11. This is due to the repeated use of the same variable name 'val' without proper initialization or checking for its previous value. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potential heap memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a different variable name for each 'kstrtoul' call to avoid overwriting the previous value.
2. Initialize the 'val' variable before using it to prevent incorrect calculations.
3. Use a more robust method to handle the 'val' variable, such as using a struct to store the values and their corresponding indices. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to handle the 'val' variable, such as using a secure string parsing library. 
5. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and address them accordingly.
