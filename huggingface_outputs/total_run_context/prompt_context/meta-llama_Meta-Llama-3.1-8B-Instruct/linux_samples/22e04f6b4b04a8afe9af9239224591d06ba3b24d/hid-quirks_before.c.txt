 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11. This is due to the presence of HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT in the static HID quirks list. This quirk is not properly handled, allowing a crafted device to provide an invalid Report ID, which can lead to heap memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT quirk from the static HID quirks list.
2. Implement proper handling for the HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT quirk in the dynamic HID quirks list.
3. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g., 3.12 or later). 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2898
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-sensor-hub.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_SENSOR_HUB is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information
