 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS due to the potential for a race condition. The line `data->rc_dev = NULL;` sets the `rc_dev` pointer to NULL, but the subsequent check `if (rdev)` may still dereference the NULL pointer if another thread has already set `data->rc_dev` to NULL. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to protect the `rc_dev` pointer from concurrent access.
2. Check if `data->rc_dev` is NULL before setting it to NULL.
3. Consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a semaphore, to protect the `rc_dev` pointer.
