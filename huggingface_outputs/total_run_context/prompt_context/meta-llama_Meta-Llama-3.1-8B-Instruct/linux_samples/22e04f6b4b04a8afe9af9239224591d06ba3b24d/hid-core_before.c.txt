 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS due to a crafted device. This is because the code does not properly check for NULL pointers before dereferencing them. Specifically, in the function usbhid_submit_report, the code does not check if the report pointer is NULL before accessing its members.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for NULL pointers before dereferencing them. This can be done by adding a simple NULL check before accessing the report pointer. For example:
```
if (report!= NULL) {
    // access report members
}
```
This will prevent the NULL pointer dereference and OOPS when a crafted device is sent to the system. Additionally, the code should also be reviewed to ensure that all potential NULL pointer dereferences are properly checked and handled.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write due to a crafted device. This is because the code does not properly check the bounds of the device's memory before writing to it. Specifically, in the
