 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11. This is due to the possibility of receiving a UHID_OUTPUT_EV event without having received UHID_OPEN, which can lead to a crafted device providing an invalid Report ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a check to ensure that UHID_OPEN has been received before processing UHID_OUTPUT_EV events.
2. Validate the Report ID provided in UHID_OUTPUT_EV events to prevent invalid Report IDs from causing array index errors.
3. Consider upgrading to a newer kernel version that no longer sends UHID_OUTPUT_EV events. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2899
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-picolcd_core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_PICOLCD is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted device
