 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11. This is due to the possibility of receiving a "struct uhid_data_req" even though UHID_OPEN has not been received yet, which can lead to a crafted device providing an invalid Report ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a check to ensure that UHID_OPEN has been received before processing "struct uhid_data_req".
- Validate the Report ID provided in the "struct uhid_data_req" to prevent invalid Report IDs from causing array index errors. 
- Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent crafted devices from causing issues.  ```python
