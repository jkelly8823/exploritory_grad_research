 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The line "buf += 10;" increases the buffer pointer by a fixed amount without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not large enough to accommodate the increase in the pointer. The line "cnt -= 10;" also decreases the counter by a fixed amount without checking if it is within the bounds of the buffer. This can also lead to a buffer overflow if the counter is not large enough to accommodate the decrease. The while loop at the end of the function also does not check if the counter is within the bounds of the buffer before accessing the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the buffer pointer is within the bounds of the buffer before increasing it.
2. Add a check to ensure that the counter is within the bounds of the buffer before decreasing it.
3. Add a check to ensure that the counter is within the bounds of the buffer before accessing the buffer in the while loop.
