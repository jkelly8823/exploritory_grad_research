 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11. This is due to the presence of the UHID_OUTPUT_EV enum value which is marked as obsolete but still present in the code. This can lead to a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or arbitrary code execution via a crafted device that provides an invalid Report ID.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the obsolete enum value UHID_OUTPUT_EV to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
2. Update the code to handle the conversion of events into raw output reports via UHID_OUTPUT in newer kernels.
3. Consider adding input validation to prevent crafted devices from causing security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2899
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-picolcd_core.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_PICOLCD is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS
