 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) due to an invalid syscall number. This is because the code does not properly handle syscall numbers greater than or equal to NR_syscalls. When an invalid syscall number is encountered, the code attempts to call a non-existent syscall handler, leading to a system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the syscall number is within the valid range before attempting to call the syscall handler.
2. Implement a fallback mechanism to handle invalid syscall numbers, such as returning an error code or triggering a trap.
3. Consider adding additional error handling and logging to provide more information about the invalid syscall number. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-4508
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled and the sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as demonstrated by number 1000.
