 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) due to an invalid syscall number. This is because the code does not properly validate the syscall number before using it to access the vdso. The vulnerability is present in the line where the restorer is set to the vdso, as the syscall number is not checked for validity.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the syscall number is valid before accessing the vdso.
2. Use a safer method to access the vdso, such as using the syscall number to index into an array of valid vdso addresses.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle syscall numbers, such as using a whitelist of allowed syscall numbers.  ```c
if (syscall_number >= 0 && syscall_number < NR_syscalls) {
    restorer = current->mm->context.vdso +
        selected_vdso32->sym___kernel_sigreturn + syscall_number;
} else {
    // Handle invalid syscall number
}
