 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) due to an invalid syscall number. This is because the code does not properly handle the syscall number, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper error handling for invalid syscall numbers.
2. Validate the syscall number before passing it to the kernel.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow valid syscall numbers. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-4508
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled and the sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as demonstrated by number 1000.  The code sample provided does not directly contain the vulnerability, but it is related to the same issue. The vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, not in the provided code. However, the code may be affected by the vulnerability if it is used with a
