 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) due to an invalid syscall number. This is because the code does not properly handle the syscall number, allowing a local user to cause a system crash by passing an invalid syscall number.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the syscall number is valid before passing it to the put_user_ex function.
2. Consider using a safer function to handle the syscall number, such as one that checks for invalid values before passing them to the put_user_ex function. 
3. Implement additional error handling to prevent the system from crashing in case of an invalid syscall number. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to handle the syscall number, such as using a whitelist of valid syscall numbers.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
