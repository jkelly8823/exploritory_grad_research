 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as demonstrated by number 1000. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle the syscall number in the `fail` function, which is marked as `noreturn` but still allows for a format string vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the syscall number in the `fail` function to prevent invalid syscall numbers from being used.
2. Use a safer alternative to `printf` for the `fail` function, such as `snprintf` or `vsnprintf`.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle the syscall number, such as using a whitelist of allowed syscall numbers.
