 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) due to an invalid syscall number. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where the syscall number is invalid, which can cause the system to crash. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel (CVE-2014-4508).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle invalid syscall numbers. This can be done by checking the syscall number before calling it, and returning an error if it is invalid. For example:
```c
if (syscall_number < 0 || syscall_number >= NR_syscalls) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
``` 
This will prevent the system from crashing due to an invalid syscall number. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles other edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.  ```c
```c
int syscall_number = 1000;
if (syscall_number < 0 || syscall_number >= NR_syscalls) {
    return -EINVAL;
}
