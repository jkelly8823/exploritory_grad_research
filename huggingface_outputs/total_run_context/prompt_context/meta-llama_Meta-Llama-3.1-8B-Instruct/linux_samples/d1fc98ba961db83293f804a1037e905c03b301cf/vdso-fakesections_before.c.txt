 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-4508 because it uses an uninitialized value for the number of symbols in the section table. This is a known bug in the Go runtime that has been addressed in the Go runtime in this issue: https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=8197. However, this code is a hack to keep broken Go programs working and is specific to the 64-bit vDSO.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove this hack and use the fixed Go runtime.
2. If the fixed Go runtime is not available, use a different approach to provide a minimal section table that does not rely on an uninitialized value. 
3. Consider using a more robust solution that does not rely on a hack. 
4. Update the code to use the latest version of the Go runtime. 
5. Consider using a different programming language that does not have this issue.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
