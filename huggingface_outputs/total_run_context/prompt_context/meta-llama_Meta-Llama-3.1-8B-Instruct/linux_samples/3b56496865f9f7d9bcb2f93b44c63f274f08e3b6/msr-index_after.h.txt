 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a list of AMD64 microcode model specific registers (MSRs). The vulnerability CVE-2013-6885 is related to the interaction between locked instructions and write-combined memory types on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh processors. However, the code sample does not contain any code that would interact with these registers or instructions, it is simply a list of MSR definitions. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to this specific CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this CVE. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any code that interacts with MSRs or other low-level hardware resources is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) vulnerability in the AMD64 architecture allows local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel memory via a crafted application.
