 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the microcode on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh processors. The code only defines a set of MSR (Model-Specific Register) addresses, which are used to access and modify processor-specific settings. The code does not contain any instructions that could potentially trigger the errata 793 issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-6885 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, it is recommended to use the latest microcode updates to ensure that the processor is running with the latest patches. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
The Spectre variant 2 vulnerability allows local users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel memory via a side-channel attack, aka the Spectre vulnerability.

Code Sample:
