 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be affected by the AMD microcode vulnerability described in CVE-2013-6885. The code snippet appears to be setting CPU capabilities and defining arrays for AMD errata, but it does not involve any locked instructions or write-combined memory types.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to this specific issue. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential interactions with locked instructions or write-combined memory types, as these could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to keep up-to-date with the latest AMD microcode updates to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
