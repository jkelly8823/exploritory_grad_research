 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) due to a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode. This is because the recalculate_apic_map function does not properly validate the input from the guest OS, allowing an attacker to cause a host OS crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input from the guest OS before processing it in the recalculate_apic_map function.
2. Implement proper error handling to prevent the host OS from crashing in case of a crafted ICR write operation.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure to store the APIC map, such as a hash table, to prevent attacks that rely on the current linear search. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-6376
CVE Description:
The recalculate_apic_map function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.12.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode.  VULNERABLE: YES
