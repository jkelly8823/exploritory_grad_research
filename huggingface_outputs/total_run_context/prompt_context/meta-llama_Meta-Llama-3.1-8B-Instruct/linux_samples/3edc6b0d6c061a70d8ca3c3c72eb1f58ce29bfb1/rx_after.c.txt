 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24587 vulnerability. This is because the code does not require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. The code checks if the frame is protected and if the key color matches, but it does not check if the frame is a fragment. This allows an adversary to abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key.
2. Update the code to handle fragmented frames correctly.
3. Consider using a more secure encryption method, such as AES.

CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24586
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted
