 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24587 vulnerability. This is because the code does not ensure that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. In lines 14-15, the code checks if the received frame is protected and if the key color matches the stored key color. However, it does not check if the frame is a fragment of a larger frame that was encrypted under a different key. This allows an attacker to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. This can be done by checking the sequence number of the received frame against the stored sequence number.
2. Update the code to handle fragmented frames correctly. This may involve storing the sequence number of each fragment and checking it against the stored sequence number when a new fragment is received. 
3. Consider using a more secure encryption protocol, such as AES-CCM, which does not have the same vulnerabilities as WEP, CCMP, and GCMP
