 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-29374 issue because it does not properly consider the semantics of read operations when using the get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation for a copy-on-write page. The code checks if the page is KSM or has multiple references, but it does not account for the possibility of read-only access. This can grant unintended write access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the page is not writable before reusing it.
2. Use the get_user_pages_remote function to get the page references, which takes into account the semantics of read operations.
3. Consider using the get_user_pages_fast function, which is more efficient but still takes into account the semantics of read operations.
