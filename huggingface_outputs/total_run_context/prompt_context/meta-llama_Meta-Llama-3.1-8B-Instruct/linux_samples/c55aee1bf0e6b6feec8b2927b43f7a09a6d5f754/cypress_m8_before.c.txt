 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3137. The vulnerability is related to a USB device without both an interrupt-in and an interrupt-out endpoint descriptor. However, the code sample checks if the interrupt_in_urb is empty before proceeding, which would prevent the NULL pointer dereference and system crash caused by the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is secure against the CVE-2016-3137 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the interrupt_in_urb is properly initialized and handled. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000116
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.12.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the net/sched action.c file, where a user-space controlled'struct tcf_action' pointer is dereferenced after it has been freed.

Code Sample:
	struct tcf_action *act = tcf_action_find_by_id(rtm->table, id);
	if (!act)
		return -ESRCH;

	tcf_action_destroy(act);
	tcf_action_destroy
