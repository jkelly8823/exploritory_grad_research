 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow. The condition `in_size < 6` is always true, and the condition `in_size < be32_to_cpu(*((__be32 *) (priv->data_buffer + 2)))` is not checked for overflow. If `in_size` is a large value, it may overflow when subtracted from `be32_to_cpu(*((__be32 *) (priv->data_buffer + 2)))`, leading to incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer comparison operator, such as `<=` instead of `<`, to avoid integer overflow.
2. Check for overflow before performing the subtraction. This can be done by checking if `in_size` is greater than `be32_to_cpu(*((__be32 *) (priv->data_buffer + 2)))` before performing the subtraction. 
3. Consider using a library function that can handle large integers, such as `long long` or a library that can handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic. 
4. Consider using a safer data type, such as `uint32_t` or `uint64_t`, to represent the size of the buffer.
