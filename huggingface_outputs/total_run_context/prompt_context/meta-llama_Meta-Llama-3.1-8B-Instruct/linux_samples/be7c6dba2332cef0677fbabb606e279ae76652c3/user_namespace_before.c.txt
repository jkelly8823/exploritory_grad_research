 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships. The code checks if the user ID or group ID matches the file's user ID or group ID, but it does not consider the case where the user or group has supplemental group memberships. This allows an attacker to bypass intended file permissions by leveraging a POSIX ACL containing an entry for the group category that is more restrictive than the entry for the other category.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the user or group has supplemental group memberships before making the comparison.
2. Use the `kuid_has_supplemental` and `kgid_has_supplemental` functions to check for supplemental group memberships.
3. Update the code to properly handle supplemental group memberships when making the comparison. For example, use the `kuid_get_real` and `kgid_get_real` functions to get the real user ID or group ID, which takes into account supplemental group memberships.
