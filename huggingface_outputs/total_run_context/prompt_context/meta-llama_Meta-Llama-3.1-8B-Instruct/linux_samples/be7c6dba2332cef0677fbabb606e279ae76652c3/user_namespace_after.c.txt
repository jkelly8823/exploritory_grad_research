 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships. The line of code that checks if the uid is equal to the file's credential's fsuid is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. This is because the uid_eq function does not take into account the supplemental group memberships.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly check for supplemental group memberships. This can be done by using the kuid_from_kgid function to get the group ID from the kernel user ID, and then checking if the group ID is in the file's credential's group list. The modified code should look like this:
```c
kuid_t uid = make_kuid(ns->parent, id);
kgid_t gid = kuid_from_kgid(uid);
if (gid_valid(gid) && group_in_list(gid, file->f_cred->group_info))
	return true;
```
This will ensure that the code properly checks for supplemental group memberships and prevents the CVE-2014-8989 vulnerability.
