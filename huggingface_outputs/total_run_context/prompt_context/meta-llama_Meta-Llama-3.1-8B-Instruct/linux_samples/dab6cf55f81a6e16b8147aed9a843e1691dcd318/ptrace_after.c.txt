 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15, 23
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack due to the improper restriction of address-space control operations in PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA requests. This allows a local user to obtain read and write access to kernel memory locations, and consequently gain privileges. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the address-space-control bits and addressing mode bits are checked. The code does not properly validate the input data, allowing an attacker to manipulate the psw mask and gain unauthorized access to kernel memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input data more thoroughly to prevent unauthorized access to kernel memory.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the address-space-control bits and addressing mode bits are properly validated.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate data structure to store the psw mask, to prevent unauthorized access to kernel memory.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3534
CVE Description:
arch/s390/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.8 on the s390 platform does not properly restrict address-space control operations in PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA requests, which
