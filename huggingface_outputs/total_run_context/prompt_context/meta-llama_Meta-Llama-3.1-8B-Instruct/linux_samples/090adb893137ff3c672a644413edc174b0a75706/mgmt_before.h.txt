 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any format string vulnerability. The code defines constants and a struct, but there is no function that uses format specifiers to construct a string. The vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2852 is related to the improper construction of an error message in the b43_request_firmware function, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any format string vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and follow secure coding guidelines.  ```c
#define MGMT_STATUS_NOT_POWERED		0x0f
#define MGMT_STATUS_CANCELLED		0x10
#define MGMT_STATUS_INVALID_INDEX	0x11

struct mgmt_hdr {
	__le16	opcode;
	__le16	index;
```
