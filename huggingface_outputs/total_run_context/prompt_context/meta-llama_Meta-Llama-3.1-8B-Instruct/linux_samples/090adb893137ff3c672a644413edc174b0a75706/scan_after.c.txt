 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a format string vulnerability. The code is simply copying data from one structure to another using memcpy. There is no indication of any format string specifiers being used in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any modifications to prevent the identified vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested before deployment.
