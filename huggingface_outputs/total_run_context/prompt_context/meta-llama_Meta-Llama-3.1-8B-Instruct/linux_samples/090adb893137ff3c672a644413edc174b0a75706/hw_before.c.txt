 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4. This vulnerability allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging root access and including format string specifiers in an fwpostfix modprobe parameter, leading to improper construction of an error message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. Use a secure method to construct error messages, such as using a secure function like snprintf.
3. Validate user input to prevent the inclusion of format string specifiers.
