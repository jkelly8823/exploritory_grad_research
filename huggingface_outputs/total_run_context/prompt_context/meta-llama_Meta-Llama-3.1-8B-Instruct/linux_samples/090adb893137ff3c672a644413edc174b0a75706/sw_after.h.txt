 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a format string vulnerability. The code appears to be a header file containing function declarations, and does not contain any format string specifiers or functions that could be used to inject such specifiers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues, such as buffer overflows or other types of vulnerabilities, and to ensure that the functions declared in this header file are properly implemented in the corresponding source files. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure coding practice, such as using printf-style functions with format specifiers, to prevent format string vulnerabilities in the future.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2852, CVE Description: Format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging root access and including format string specifiers in an fwpostfix modprobe parameter, leading to improper construction of an
