 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a list of hexadecimal values. However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the values at line 10 contain a format string specifier (%11). This is a classic indicator of a format string vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The presence of this specifier in the code suggests that the b43_request_firmware function in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver is vulnerable to a format string attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a safer method of formatting strings, such as using the snprintf function.
2. Validate all user input to prevent the inclusion of format string specifiers.
3. Consider using a secure coding library, such as the Secure Coding Library for Linux, to help prevent format string vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE-2013-2852: Format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4.  This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain privileges.  The recommended fix is to
