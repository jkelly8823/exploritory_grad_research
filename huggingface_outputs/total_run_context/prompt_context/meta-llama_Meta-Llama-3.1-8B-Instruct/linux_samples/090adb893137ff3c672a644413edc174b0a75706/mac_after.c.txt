 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in the RT_TRACE function call on lines 14-15. The format string is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject format specifiers and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure function to print the message, such as printk or dev_info, which do not allow format string injection.
2. Sanitize the format string by removing any format specifiers before passing it to the RT_TRACE function.
3. Use a secure logging mechanism, such as the Linux kernel's logging system, to prevent format string vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2852
CVE Description:
Format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging root access and including format string specifiers in an fwpostfix modprobe parameter, leading to improper construction of an error message.  The vulnerability is present in the RT_TRACE function call on lines
