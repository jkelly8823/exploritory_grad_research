 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4. This is due to the improper construction of an error message in the b43_request_firmware function, which allows local users to gain privileges by including format string specifiers in an fwpostfix modprobe parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g. 3.9.5 or later).
2. Use a secure coding practice to prevent format string vulnerabilities, such as using printf or snprintf instead of format strings.
3. Validate user input to prevent the inclusion of format string specifiers in the fwpostfix modprobe parameter. 
4. Consider using a secure firmware loading mechanism to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.  ```bash
