 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. This is because the code is using the %x format specifier to print the value of a pointer, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the stack. The format string vulnerability is present in the line where the value of the pointer is printed using the %x format specifier.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the %p format specifier instead of %x to print the value of a pointer. This will prevent the format string vulnerability.
2. Use a secure function like printf or snprintf to print the value of the pointer. These functions are designed to prevent format string vulnerabilities.
3. Use a secure library like libasan to detect and prevent format string vulnerabilities. 
4. Review the code and ensure that all format specifiers are properly sanitized and validated to prevent format string vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000367
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists in the way the Linux kernel handles the "struct stat" data type. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious file with a specially crafted "struct stat" data
