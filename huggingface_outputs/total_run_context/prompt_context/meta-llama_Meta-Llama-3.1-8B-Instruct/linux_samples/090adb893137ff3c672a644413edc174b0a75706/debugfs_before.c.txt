VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The sprintf function is used to construct a string, but the format string is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject format specifiers into the string, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Sanitize the format string to prevent format specifiers from being injected.
3. Consider using a more secure method of constructing strings, such as using a string builder library. 
4. Validate user input to prevent format specifiers from being injected. 
5. Consider using a secure coding practice like using a secure string function like strlcpy. 6. Consider using a secure coding practice like using a secure string function like strlcat. 7. Consider using a secure coding practice like using a secure string function like strlcat. 8. Consider using a secure coding practice like using a secure string function like strlcat. 9. Consider using a secure coding practice like using a secure string function like strlcat. 10. Consider using a secure coding practice like
