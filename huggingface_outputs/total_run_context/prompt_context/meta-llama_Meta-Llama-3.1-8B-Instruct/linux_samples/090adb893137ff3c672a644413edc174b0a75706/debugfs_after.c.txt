 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain the format string vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2852. The code does not use the fwpostfix modprobe parameter, and the format string is not constructed from user input. The code does use sprintf to construct a string, but the format string is hardcoded and does not contain any format specifiers that could be used to inject user input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the format string vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2852. However, it is still good practice to use safer string formatting functions like snprintf or printf to avoid potential issues. Consider using a safer string formatting function to construct the debug information string.  Consider using a safer string formatting function to construct the debug information string.
