 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions in the KVM subsystem. This vulnerability is present in the lines where the function `crash_kexec_secondary` is defined and the function `overlaps_crashkernel` is defined. These functions are not properly handling the RIP-relative instructions, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the decoder-table flags for the KVM subsystem to include the intended flags for RIP-relative instructions.
2. Properly handle the RIP-relative instructions in the `crash_kexec_secondary` and `overlaps_crashkernel` functions to prevent NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash.
3. Implement additional checks to ensure that the functions are properly handling the RIP-relative instructions before executing them.
