 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this issue. However, it is worth noting that this code is a kernel module and should be reviewed and tested thoroughly to ensure it does not contain any other vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  The vulnerability is related to the handling of RIP-relative instructions in the KVM subsystem. 
Code Sample:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y;
printf("%d", z
