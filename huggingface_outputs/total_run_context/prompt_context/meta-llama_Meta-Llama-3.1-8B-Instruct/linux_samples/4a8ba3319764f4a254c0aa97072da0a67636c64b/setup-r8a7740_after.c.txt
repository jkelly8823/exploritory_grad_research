Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the memory mapping and interrupt handling are properly configured and handled in the system.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	int y = 10;
	int z = x + y;
	int result = x + y + z;
	int sum = x + y + z
