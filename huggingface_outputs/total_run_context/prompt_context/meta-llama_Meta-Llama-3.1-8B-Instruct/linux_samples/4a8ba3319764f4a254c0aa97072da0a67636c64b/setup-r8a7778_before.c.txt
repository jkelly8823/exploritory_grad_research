CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample: 
int x = 5; 
int y = 10; 
int z = x + y; 
printf("%d", z
