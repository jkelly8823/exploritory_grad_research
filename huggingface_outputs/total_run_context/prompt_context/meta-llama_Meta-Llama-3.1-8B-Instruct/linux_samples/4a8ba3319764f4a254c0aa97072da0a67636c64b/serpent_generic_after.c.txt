VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a module for the Linux kernel, but it does not contain any code that would be affected by this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2014-8480. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to follow secure coding practices. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied data in the `sock_diag_get_dump` function in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_log.c. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).

Code Sample:
int sock_diag_get_dump(struct sk_buff *skb, struct nlmsghdr *nlh)
{
    struct
