 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code, but rather a list of contributors to a Linux kernel patch. However, based on the description of the vulnerability, it appears that the vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel. The code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to this vulnerability. Nevertheless, the vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2, and the code sample is likely part of a patch that addresses this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None, as the code sample does not contain any code that is susceptible to this vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the Linux kernel is updated to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-1353
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. An attacker able to create a KVM guest could use this flaw to crash the host system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the host.

Code Sample:
```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <
