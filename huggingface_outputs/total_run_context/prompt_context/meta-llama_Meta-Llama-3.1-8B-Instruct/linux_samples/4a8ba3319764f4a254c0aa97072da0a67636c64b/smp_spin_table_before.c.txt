 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be related to CPU operations and cache flushing, which is unrelated to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities.
