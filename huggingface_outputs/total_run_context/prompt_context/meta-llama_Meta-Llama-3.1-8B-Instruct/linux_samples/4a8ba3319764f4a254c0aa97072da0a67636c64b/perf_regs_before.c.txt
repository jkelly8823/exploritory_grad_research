 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a simple function that returns a value based on a conditional statement.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to ensure that it does not introduce any new vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample: 
int x = 5; 
int y = 10; 
if (x > y)
