 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480. The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This vulnerability allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application. The specific lines that are vulnerable are lines 5, where the instruction decoder is used to load the value of TI_FLAGS(r1) into register r4.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c to include the intended decoder-table flags for RIP-relative instructions.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent guest OS users from causing a denial of service via a crafted application.
3. Consider using a more secure method to load the value of TI_FLAGS(r1) into register r4, such as using a load instruction that is not vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability.  *******************************************************************************************/VULNERABLE: YES
