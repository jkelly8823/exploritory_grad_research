 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that is related to the KVM subsystem or the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. The code appears to be a module description and aliasing for cryptographic algorithms, which does not match the vulnerability description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to ensure that the cryptographic algorithms used in the code are up-to-date and secure. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities specific to the cryptographic algorithms being used.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y; 
if (z > 20)
