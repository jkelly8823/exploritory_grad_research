 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The code is checking for certain conditions and performing operations based on those conditions, but it does not involve the instruction decoder or any RIP-relative instructions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested and validated.

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  The code sample provided does not contain any RIP-relative instructions, and therefore does not contain the vulnerability described in this CVE.  The code is
