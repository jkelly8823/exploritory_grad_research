 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability CVE-2014-8480. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. This code appears to be a decompression and boot process for a kernel, and does not involve the KVM subsystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly sanitized and validated to prevent other potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of the KVM subsystem should be carefully considered and implemented according to the relevant documentation and best practices.  ```bash

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied data when processing the "perf_event_open" system call. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Code Sample:
int perf_event
