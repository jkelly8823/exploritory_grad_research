 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known issue in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that all decoder-table flags are properly set for RIP-relative instructions.
3. Consider using a code review tool to identify and fix similar vulnerabilities in the codebase.  ```bash
