 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known issue in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The get_tod_clock_ext function uses the stcke instruction, which is a RIP-relative instruction, and the lack of decoder-table flags can cause a NULL pointer dereference when the instruction is executed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a different instruction or method to retrieve the TOD clock, such as using the rdtime instruction.
3. Apply a patch to the KVM subsystem to add the missing decoder-table flags for the stcke instruction. 4. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using RIP-relative instructions in sensitive code paths. 5. Consider using a different architecture or platform that is not affected by this vulnerability. 6. Use a code review process to identify and fix similar vulnerabilities in the codebase. 7. Consider using a secure coding
