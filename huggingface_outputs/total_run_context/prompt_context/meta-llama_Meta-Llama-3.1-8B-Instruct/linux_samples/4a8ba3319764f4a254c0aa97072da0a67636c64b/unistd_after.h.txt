 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a list of system call numbers and a comment about system calls that are not present on 64-bit systems.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that any system calls used in the code are properly checked for availability on the target platform. This can be done by checking the __NR_ prefix of the system call number to ensure it is not a 32-bit system call. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL
