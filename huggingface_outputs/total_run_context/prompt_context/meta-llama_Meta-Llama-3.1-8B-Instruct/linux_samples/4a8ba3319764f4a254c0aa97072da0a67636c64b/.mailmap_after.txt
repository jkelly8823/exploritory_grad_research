 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code, but rather a list of contributors to the Linux kernel. However, based on the description of the vulnerability, it appears that the issue lies in the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. This suggests that the vulnerability is related to the kernel's emulation of x86 instructions, rather than the code sample itself. Therefore, the code sample is not directly vulnerable, but the underlying kernel code may be.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the kernel code in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c should be reviewed and updated to include the intended decoder-table flags for RIP-relative instructions. This may involve patching the kernel code to fix the issue. It is not recommended to modify the code sample provided, as it is not directly related to the vulnerability. Instead, focus on updating the kernel code to ensure that it is secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
