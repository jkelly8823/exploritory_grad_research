 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is specific to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to follow secure coding practices.  The code sample appears to be a simple data structure and does not contain any complex instructions that would be susceptible to this type of vulnerability.  It is also worth noting that this code sample is not part of the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is where the vulnerability is present.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this CVE.
