 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions in the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c to include the intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2014-8480 to the Linux kernel. 
3. Ensure that the KVM subsystem is updated to the latest version. 
4. Regularly update and patch the Linux kernel to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
