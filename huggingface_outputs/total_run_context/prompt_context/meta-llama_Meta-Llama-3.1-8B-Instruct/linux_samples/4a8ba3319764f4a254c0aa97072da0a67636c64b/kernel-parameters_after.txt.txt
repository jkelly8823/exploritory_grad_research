 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code appears to be a list of kernel parameters and their descriptions, which does not involve the instruction decoder or any RIP-relative instructions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or issues. Additionally, ensure that the kernel is up-to-date and patched to prevent any potential security risks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
char *ptr = (char *) 0x1000;
char *ptr2 = (char *) 0x2000;
char *ptr3 = (char *) 0x3000
