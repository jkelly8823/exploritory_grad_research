VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.

Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	if (x > 10) {
		printf("x is greater than 10\n");
	} else {
		printf("x is less than or equal to 10\n");
	}
