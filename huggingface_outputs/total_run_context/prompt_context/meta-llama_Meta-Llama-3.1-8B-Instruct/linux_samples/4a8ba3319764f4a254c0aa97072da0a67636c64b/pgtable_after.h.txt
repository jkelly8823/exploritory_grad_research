 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known issue in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The code is using the pmd_index function to calculate the index of the pmd, but it does not check if the pud is valid before accessing it. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when the pud is NULL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the pud is valid before accessing it using the pud_valid function.
2. Use the pud_pfn function to get the pfn of the pud, and then use the pfn_to_page function to get the page.
3. Use the pud_page function to get the page from the pud, and then use the page_to_pfn function to get the pfn.
4. Use the pud_write function to set the pud to a valid value before accessing it.
