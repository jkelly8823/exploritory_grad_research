CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <string.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <sys/socket.h>
	#include <netinet/in.h
