VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application. 

Code Sample:
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		if (i == 5) {
			// code that may cause a null pointer dereference
			int *ptr = NULL;
			*ptr
