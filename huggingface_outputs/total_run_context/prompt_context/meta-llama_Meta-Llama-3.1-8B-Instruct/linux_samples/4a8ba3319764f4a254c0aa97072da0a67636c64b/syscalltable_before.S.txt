 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the sys_getrandom, sys_memfd_create, and sys_bpf system calls, which are not properly handled by the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. The lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions allows a guest OS user to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using system calls that are not properly handled by the instruction decoder.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent NULL pointer dereferences and host OS crashes.

CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.13.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the net/sched/act_pedit.c file, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted
