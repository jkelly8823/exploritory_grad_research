 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference due to the lack of a NULL check for the 'obj' pointer in the i915_gem_create function. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability, where the 'obj' pointer is used after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The fix for this vulnerability is to add a NULL check for the 'obj' pointer before using it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if 'obj' is NULL before proceeding with the rest of the function. The corrected code would look like this:
```
if (obj == NULL) {
	return -ENOMEM;
}
```
This check ensures that the function returns an error immediately if 'obj' is NULL, preventing the use-after-free vulnerability.

CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
