 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the KVM subsystem or the instruction decoder in the Linux kernel. It appears to be a module initialization and exit function for a kernel module, along with some aliasing for cryptographic modules. There is no indication of the use of RIP-relative instructions or any other vulnerability related to CVE-2014-8480.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test kernel modules for potential security issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the emulation of the'sgdt' and'sgdt' instructions. This occurred when the'sgdt' instruction was used to load a value into the GDTR register, and the 'lgdt' instruction was used to load a value into the LDTR register. A guest user could use this flaw to crash the host kernel or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the host.

Code Sample:
struct kvm_vcpu
