VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the `getwd()` function in the `unistd.h` header file does not properly validate the path length, which allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted path.

Code Sample:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char buffer[256];
	getwd(buffer);
	printf("%s\n", buffer);
	return 0;
}
