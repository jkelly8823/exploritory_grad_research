 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any instances of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8480. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code appears to be related to OMAP PMIC initialization and does not involve any virtualization or emulation of instructions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any instances of the vulnerability and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480, CVE Description: The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
