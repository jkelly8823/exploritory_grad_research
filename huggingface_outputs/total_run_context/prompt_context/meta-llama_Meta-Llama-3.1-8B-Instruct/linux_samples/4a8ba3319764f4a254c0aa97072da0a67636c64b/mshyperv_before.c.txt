 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. This code appears to be a platform initialization function for a Hypervisor.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and ensure that it is properly tested and validated before deployment.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
int x = 5;
int y = 10
