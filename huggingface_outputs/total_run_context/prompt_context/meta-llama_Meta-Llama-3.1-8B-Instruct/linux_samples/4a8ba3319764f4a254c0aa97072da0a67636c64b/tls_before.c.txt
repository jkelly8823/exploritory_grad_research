 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known issue in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The code does not check for the presence of these flags, which allows a crafted application in the guest OS to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the decoder-table flags are properly set for RIP-relative instructions.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle guest OS applications, such as using a sandboxing mechanism.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host
