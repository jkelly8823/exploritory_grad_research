 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be related to the KVM subsystem or the Linux kernel, and does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code is a simple loop that populates a resource structure with information from an array of MPU IRQs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability.  However, it would be beneficial to add error checking to ensure that the loop does not access memory outside the bounds of the oh->mpu_irqs array.  This could be done by checking the value of mpu_irqs_cnt before the loop.  For example: if (mpu_irqs_cnt > 0) {... }  This would prevent the loop from accessing memory outside the bounds of the array.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to add a check to ensure that the index i is within the bounds of the oh->mpu_irqs array.  This could be done by adding a check: if (i < mpu_irqs_cnt) {... }  This would
