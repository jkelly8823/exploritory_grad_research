VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, 61, 66, 71, 76, 81
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions in the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. This vulnerability is present in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The code is attempting to access memory locations without proper checks, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and subsequent crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper checks to ensure that memory locations are accessed safely before dereferencing them.
3. Use a secure coding practice to avoid NULL pointer dereferences, such as using the "if" statement to check for NULL before accessing memory locations.
