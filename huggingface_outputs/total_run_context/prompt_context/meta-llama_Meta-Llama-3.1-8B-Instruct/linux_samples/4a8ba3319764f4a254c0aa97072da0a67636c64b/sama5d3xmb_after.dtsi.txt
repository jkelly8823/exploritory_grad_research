 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the KVM subsystem or the Linux kernel, and therefore does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8480. The code appears to be a configuration snippet for an audio codec, likely for a device tree file in a Linux-based system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential issues or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, ensure that the device tree file is properly configured and validated to prevent any potential issues during system boot or operation.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.

Code Sample:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y;
