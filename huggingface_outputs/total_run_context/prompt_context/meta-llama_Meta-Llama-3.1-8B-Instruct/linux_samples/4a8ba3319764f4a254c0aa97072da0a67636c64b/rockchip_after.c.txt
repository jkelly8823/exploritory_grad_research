 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions in the KVM subsystem. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The code snippet provided is not directly related to the KVM subsystem, but it is part of the Linux kernel and may be affected by this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2014-8480 to the Linux kernel source code.
3. Consider using a different kernel version or patch level that is not affected by this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash
