VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-1353
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 5.1 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the netfilter subsystem, where a user can create a netfilter hook and then delete the netfilter hook while the hook is still being processed, leading to a use-after-free bug.

Code Sample:
int main() {
    struct net_device *netdev = alloc_netdev(sizeof(struct net_device), "eth0", netdev_setup);
