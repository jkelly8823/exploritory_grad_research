 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be related to GPIO flags and does not contain any code that would be susceptible to this type of vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the `getwd()` function in the `unistd.h` header file does not properly validate the path length, which allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted path.

Code Sample:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[256];
    getwd(buffer);
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
