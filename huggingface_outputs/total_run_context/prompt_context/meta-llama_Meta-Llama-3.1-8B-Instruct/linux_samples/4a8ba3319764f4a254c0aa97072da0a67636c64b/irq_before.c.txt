 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module that handles machine check polls and hypervisor callback interrupts. It does not involve any instruction decoding or emulation, which is the specific functionality affected by the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly tested and validated to prevent any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied data in the `sock_diag_get_dump` function, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted `sock_diag_get_dump` request.

Code Sample:
static int sock_diag_get_dump(struct sk_buff *skb, struct netlink_callback *cb)
{
	struct sock_diag_req *
