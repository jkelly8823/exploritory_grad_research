 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. This code appears to be a kernel configuration file, selecting various kernel features and options.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this issue. However, it is worth noting that this code is a kernel configuration file and should be reviewed and validated to ensure that it is correct and secure. Additionally, the kernel should be kept up to date with the latest security patches to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480, CVE_Description:The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
