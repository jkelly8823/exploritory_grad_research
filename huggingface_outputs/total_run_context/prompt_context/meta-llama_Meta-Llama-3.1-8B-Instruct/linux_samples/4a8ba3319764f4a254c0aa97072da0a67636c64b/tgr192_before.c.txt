VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5195
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.8.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from process memory by reading /proc/vmstat.

Code Sample:
	int ret;
	struct vm_area_struct *vma;
	struct mm_struct *mm;
	struct task_struct *tsk;

	ret = get_task_mm(tsk, &mm);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	vma = find_vma(mm, 0);
	if (!vma)
		goto out;

	/*... */
out:
	kfree(mm);
	return 0;
}
