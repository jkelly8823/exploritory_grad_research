 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the KVM subsystem or the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. The code is a module initialization and exit function for an AGP driver, and it includes a module author and license statement. There is no indication of the use of RIP-relative instructions or any other vulnerability related to the CVE-2014-8480.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of GPL and additional rights in the license statement may require additional considerations for the driver's compatibility and usage.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
