VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied data in the `sock_diag_get_dump` function, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted `sock_diag_get_dump` request.

Code Sample:
int sock_diag_get_dump(struct sk_buff *skb, struct nlmsghdr *nlh)
{
	struct sock_diag
