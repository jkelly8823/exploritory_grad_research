 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2014-8480) in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel. The vulnerability is present in the `crash_kexec_secondary` function, which is not properly handling the RIP-relative instructions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2014-8480 to the kernel source code.
3. Ensure that the `crash_kexec_secondary` function is properly handling RIP-relative instructions to prevent the NULL pointer dereference. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
