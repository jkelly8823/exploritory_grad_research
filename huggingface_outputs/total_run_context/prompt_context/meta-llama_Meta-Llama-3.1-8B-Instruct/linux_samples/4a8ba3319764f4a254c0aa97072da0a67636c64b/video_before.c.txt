 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to this CVE. However, it is recommended to ensure that any code that interacts with the KVM subsystem is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y; 
int* p = &z;
printf("%d", *p);
