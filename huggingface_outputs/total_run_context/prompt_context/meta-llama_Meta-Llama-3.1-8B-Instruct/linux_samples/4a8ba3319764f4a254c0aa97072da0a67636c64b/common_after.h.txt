 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a header file containing function declarations and macros for OMAP devices.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that any code that interacts with the KVM subsystem is properly validated and tested to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample: 
int x = 5; 
int y = 10; 
int z = x +
