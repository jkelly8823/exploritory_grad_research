 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. This code appears to be a device tree blob (DTB) file, which is used to describe the hardware components of a system to the Linux kernel. It does not contain any executable code that could be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the device tree blob is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.13.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the net/sched/act_pedit.c file, where the pedit structure is not properly cleared when it is freed, allowing an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service (crash) or gain privileges.

Code Sample:
		struct pedit {
