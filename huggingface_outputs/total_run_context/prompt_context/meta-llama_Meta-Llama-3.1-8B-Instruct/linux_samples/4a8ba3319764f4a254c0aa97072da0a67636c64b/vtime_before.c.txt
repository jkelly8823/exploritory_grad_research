VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  The code sample is for S390 architecture and does not involve the instruction decoder or RIP-relative instructions.  The vulnerability is specific to the x86 architecture and is not applicable to the S390 architecture.  Therefore,
