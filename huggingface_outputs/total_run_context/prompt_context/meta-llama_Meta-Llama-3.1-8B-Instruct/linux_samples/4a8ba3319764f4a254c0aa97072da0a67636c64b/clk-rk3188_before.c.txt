VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  This vulnerability is not applicable to the provided code.  The code is related to clock management in a Linux kernel driver and does not involve the instruction decoder or any other components that could be affected by this vulnerability.  The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE.
