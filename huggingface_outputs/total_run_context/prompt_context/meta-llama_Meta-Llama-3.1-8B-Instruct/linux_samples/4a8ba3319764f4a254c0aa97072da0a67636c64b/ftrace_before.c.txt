 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be related to trampolines and module management, which is a different part of the kernel.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and validated.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample: 
int x = 5; 
int y = 10;
