 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11, 17-20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known issue in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The code also has a potential issue with the LDT_empty macro, which may not correctly identify an empty LDT. The LDT_zero function is also vulnerable to a potential issue, as it does not correctly identify a zero user_desc structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the KVM subsystem vulnerability.
2. Review and modify the LDT_empty macro to correctly identify an empty LDT.
3. Review and modify the LDT_zero function to correctly identify a zero user_desc structure. 
4. Consider using a more robust method to identify an empty LDT, such as checking the contents of the LDT instead of relying on the LDT_empty macro. 
5. Consider using a more robust method to identify a zero user_desc structure, such as checking
