 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The code is iterating over a list of mpu_irqs and assigning values to a resource structure. The code does not contain any RIP-relative instructions or any other code that would be susceptible to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any modifications to address the described vulnerability.  The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices.  However, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of the code and the variables used.  This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to add error checking to handle any potential issues that may arise during the execution of the code.  This would make the code more robust and reliable.  However, these are general recommendations and are not specific to the described vulnerability.  The code is secure and does not require any modifications to address the described vulnerability.  The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices.  However, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of the code and the variables used
