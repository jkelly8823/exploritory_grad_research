 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample is related to timer registration and counter reading, which is a different functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the specified vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and validated.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample: 
/* 
 * arch_timer_read_counter() - read the current value of the timer counter
 *
 * This function is used to read the current value of the timer counter.
 * It returns the current value of the timer counter
