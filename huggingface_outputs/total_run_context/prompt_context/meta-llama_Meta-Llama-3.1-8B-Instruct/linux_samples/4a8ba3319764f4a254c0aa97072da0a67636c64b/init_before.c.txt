 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2014-8480. The code appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's memory mapping functionality, and it does not involve the instruction decoder or any RIP-relative instructions that could potentially lead to a NULL pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, the code could benefit from comments and documentation to improve its maintainability and understandability.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
int arch_scale_freq_capacity(struct cpuinfo_x86 *cpuid)
{
	if (cpuid->x86_model
