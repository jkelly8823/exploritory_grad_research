 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the KVM subsystem or the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. The code is related to the Linux kernel module for the GHASH message digest algorithm, which does not match the vulnerability description. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues.  ```bash
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("GHASH Message Digest Algorithm");
MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO("ghash");
MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO("ghash-generic");
``` VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem does not properly validate the nfctnl_msg_msgtype field in the nfctnl_msg structure, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted nfctnl_msg structure.

Code Sample:
struct nfctnl_msg {
    __be32 msg_type;
