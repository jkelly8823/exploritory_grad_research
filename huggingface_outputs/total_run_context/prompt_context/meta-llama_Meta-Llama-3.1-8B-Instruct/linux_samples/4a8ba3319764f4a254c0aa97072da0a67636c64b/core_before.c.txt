CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample:
	int ret = 0;
	struct device *dev = &pdev->dev;
	struct dw_dma_chip *chip = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
	struct dw_dma_window
