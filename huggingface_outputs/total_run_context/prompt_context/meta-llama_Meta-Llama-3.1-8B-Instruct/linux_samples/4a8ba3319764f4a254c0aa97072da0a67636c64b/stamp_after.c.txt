VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-4127
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 3.0.68 does not properly validate the length of the data in the iSCSI packet, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via
