 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The function clear_LDT() is supposed to clear the Local Descriptor Table (LDT) by setting it to NULL. However, the function set_ldt() is called with a NULL pointer, which can lead to a null pointer dereference. This is because the function set_ldt() does not check for NULL pointers before accessing the LDT.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for NULL pointers before accessing the LDT in the function set_ldt().
2. Use a safer function to clear the LDT, such as memset() to ensure that the LDT is properly cleared.
3. Consider using a more robust way to handle the LDT, such as using a lock to prevent concurrent access.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
