 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This is a known issue in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. The code is using the KVM subsystem to emulate certain instructions, but it is not properly handling the decoder-table flags, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a different emulation method that does not rely on the KVM subsystem.
3. Add proper handling for the decoder-table flags to prevent the NULL pointer dereference. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dere
