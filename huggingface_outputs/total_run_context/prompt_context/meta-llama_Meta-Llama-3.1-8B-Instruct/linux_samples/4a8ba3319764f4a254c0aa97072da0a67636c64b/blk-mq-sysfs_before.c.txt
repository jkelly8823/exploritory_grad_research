VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.

Code Sample:

int foo(int x)
{
	int y = x;
	return y;
}

int bar(int x)
{
	int y = x;
	return y;
}

int main()
{
	int x = 5;
	int result = foo(x);
	int result2
