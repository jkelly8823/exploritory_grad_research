 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code is checking the state of the device and performing some calculations, but it does not involve any instruction decoding or emulation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to this CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and validated.  The code could be improved by adding more comments to explain the purpose of each section and by considering the use of more descriptive variable names.  Additionally, the code could be improved by adding more error checking and handling to ensure that it can properly handle unexpected input or edge cases.  However, these are general recommendations and are not specific to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability.
