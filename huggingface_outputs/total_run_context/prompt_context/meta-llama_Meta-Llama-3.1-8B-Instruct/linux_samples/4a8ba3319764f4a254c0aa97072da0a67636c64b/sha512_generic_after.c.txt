VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is related to the KVM subsystem or the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. The code appears to be related to the SHA-512 and SHA-384 Secure Hash Algorithms, and does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is related to the vulnerability, and therefore no recommendations are necessary. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
