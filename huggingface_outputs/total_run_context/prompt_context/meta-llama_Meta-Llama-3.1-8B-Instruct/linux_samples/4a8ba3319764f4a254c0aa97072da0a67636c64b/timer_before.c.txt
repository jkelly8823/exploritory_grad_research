 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code is written in C and does not involve any x86 instruction decoding or emulation. The vulnerability is specific to the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel and is not relevant to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and validated before deployment. Additionally, the code could benefit from additional error handling and logging to improve its robustness and maintainability.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.  Code Sample: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX
