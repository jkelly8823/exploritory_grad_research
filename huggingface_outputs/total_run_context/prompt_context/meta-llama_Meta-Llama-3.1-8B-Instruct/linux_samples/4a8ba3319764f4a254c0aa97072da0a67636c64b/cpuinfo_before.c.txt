 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code snippet is checking for the presence of certain CPU features using the fcpu_has function and then making decisions based on those checks. There is no indication of any instruction decoding or emulation being performed, which is the root cause of the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of IS_ENABLED macro for conditional compilation may be a good practice to follow in this case.  The code could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the conditions being checked. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
