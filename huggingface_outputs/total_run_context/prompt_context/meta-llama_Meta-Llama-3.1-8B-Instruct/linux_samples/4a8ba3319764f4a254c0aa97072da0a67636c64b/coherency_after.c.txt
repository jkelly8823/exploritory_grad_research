 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability CVE-2014-8480. The vulnerability is related to the instruction decoder in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is not present in the provided code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480. However, it is worth noting that the code sample is a part of the Linux kernel, and the vulnerability is related to the KVM subsystem. Therefore, it is recommended to review the KVM subsystem code in the Linux kernel to ensure that it is up-to-date and patched against this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the user-supplied data in the `kvm_vcpu_ioctl_set_tss` function, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted ioctl call.

Code Sample:
int kvm_vcpu_ioctl_set_tss(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct
