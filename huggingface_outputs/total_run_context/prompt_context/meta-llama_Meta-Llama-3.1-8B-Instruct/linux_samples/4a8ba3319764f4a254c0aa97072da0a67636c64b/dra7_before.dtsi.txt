 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a device tree source (DTS) file, which is used to describe the hardware components of a system. The code snippet in question seems to be a block of device tree nodes, each describing a different DWC3 (Device Wire Controller 3) peripheral. The code does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2014-8480, which is a kernel-level vulnerability affecting the KVM subsystem. The code is simply describing the properties of the DWC3 peripherals, such as their maximum speed and data rate mode.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be a valid and secure DTS file. However, it is always a good practice to review and validate the code to ensure it meets the requirements and specifications of the system. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
