VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions in the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2. This vulnerability can be exploited by a guest OS user via a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that all decoder-table flags are properly set for all instructions.
3. Implement a robust error handling mechanism to prevent NULL pointer dereferences and host OS crashes.
