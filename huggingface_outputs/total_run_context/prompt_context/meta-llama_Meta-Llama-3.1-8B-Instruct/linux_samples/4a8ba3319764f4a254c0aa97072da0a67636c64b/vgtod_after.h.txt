 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480. The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. In this code sample, the instruction "lsl %1,%0" is a RIP-relative instruction. The lack of intended decoder-table flags for this instruction can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c to include the intended decoder-table flags for RIP-relative instructions.
2. Use a more secure instruction, such as "mov %1, %0", instead of "lsl %1,%0".
3. Add a check to ensure that the instruction is not a RIP-relative instruction before executing it.  This can be done by checking the opcode of the instruction.  If the opcode is a RIP-relative instruction, then do not execute the instruction.  Instead, return an error or handle it in a secure manner.  This will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.  This check should be done in the instruction decoder in arch
