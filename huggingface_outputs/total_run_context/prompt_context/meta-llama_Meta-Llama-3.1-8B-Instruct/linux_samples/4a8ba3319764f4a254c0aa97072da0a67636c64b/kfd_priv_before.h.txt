 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8480 due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions. This can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application. The vulnerability is present in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, which is used by the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent the execution of crafted applications that may exploit this vulnerability.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the KVM subsystem, such as a virtualization platform that is not affected by this vulnerability. 4. Regularly update and patch the Linux kernel to ensure that any newly discovered vulnerabilities are addressed. 5. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 6. Use a code analysis tool to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities in the code. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard, such as the Linux Coding Standard, to ensure that the code is written securely. 8. Implement a code review process to ensure
