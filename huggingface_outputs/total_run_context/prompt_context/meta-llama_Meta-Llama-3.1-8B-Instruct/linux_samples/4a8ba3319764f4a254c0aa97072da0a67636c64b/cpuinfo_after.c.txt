 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8480 vulnerability. The code snippet is checking for the presence of certain CPU features using the fcpu_has function, and then making decisions based on those checks. There is no indication of any instruction decoding or emulation being performed, which is the specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it's always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is not vulnerable to other potential issues. Additionally, the use of IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NIOS2_HW_DIV_SUPPORT) suggests that this code is specific to the NIOS2 architecture, and may not be applicable to other architectures. It's worth considering whether this code is properly guarded against other architectures.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of
