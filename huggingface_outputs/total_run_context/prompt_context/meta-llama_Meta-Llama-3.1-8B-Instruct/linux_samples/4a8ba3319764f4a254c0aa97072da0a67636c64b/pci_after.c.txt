VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the data in the "struct sk_buff" when processing the "ip6_find_1st_hops" function. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.

Code Sample:
static int ip6_find_1st_hops(struct sk_buff *skb, struct in6_addr *saddr,
			     struct in6_addr *daddr, int *hops)
{
	struct ipv6
