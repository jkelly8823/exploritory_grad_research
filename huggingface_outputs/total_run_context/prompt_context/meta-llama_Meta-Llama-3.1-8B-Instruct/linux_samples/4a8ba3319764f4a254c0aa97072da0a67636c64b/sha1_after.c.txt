CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the mov to/from CR8 instruction. This occurred when the instruction was used to move data from or to the CR8 register in a guest virtual machine. A privileged user within a guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the host.
