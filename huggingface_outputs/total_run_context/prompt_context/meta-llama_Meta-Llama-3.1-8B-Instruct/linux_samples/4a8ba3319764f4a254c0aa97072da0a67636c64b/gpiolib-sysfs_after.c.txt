 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash due to the lack of intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2014-8480.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.18-rc2 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2014-8480 to the Linux kernel source code.
3. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that all decoder-table flags are properly set for RIP-relative instructions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8480
CVE Description:
The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.
