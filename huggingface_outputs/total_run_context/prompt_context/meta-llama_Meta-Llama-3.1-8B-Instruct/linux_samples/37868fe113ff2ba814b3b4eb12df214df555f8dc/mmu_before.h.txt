 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the handling of IRET faults in processing NMIs. The code appears to be a data structure definition for a segment, and does not contain any assembly code or kernel-specific functionality that would be relevant to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is worth noting that the code is part of a larger kernel module, and it is possible that other parts of the code may be vulnerable to this issue. A thorough review of the kernel code is recommended to ensure that the vulnerability is properly addressed.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5157
CVE Description:
arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform mishandles IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution, which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI.  Code Sample: 
/* 
 * we put the segment information here.
 */
typedef struct {
	void *ldt
