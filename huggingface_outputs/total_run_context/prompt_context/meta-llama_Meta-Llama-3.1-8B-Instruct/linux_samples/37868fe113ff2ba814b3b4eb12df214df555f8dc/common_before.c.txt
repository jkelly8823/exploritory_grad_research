VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double fault vulnerability. The double fault handler is not properly implemented, which can lead to a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to gain privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a proper double fault handler that properly handles the double fault exception.
2. Ensure that the double fault handler is properly synchronized to prevent race conditions.
3. Consider using a more robust double fault handling mechanism, such as a dedicated double fault handler function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5157
CVE Description:
arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform mishandles IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution, which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI.  The code is vulnerable to this issue because it does not properly handle the IRET fault exception.
