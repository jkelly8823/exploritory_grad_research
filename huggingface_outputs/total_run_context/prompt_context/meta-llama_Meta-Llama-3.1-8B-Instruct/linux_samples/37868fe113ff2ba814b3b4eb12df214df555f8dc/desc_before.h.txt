 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any direct implementation of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-5157. The vulnerability is related to the handling of IRET faults in the Linux kernel, specifically on the x86_64 platform. The provided code seems to be related to loading and managing Local Descriptor Tables (LDTs) in a CPU, which is a different context. However, it's worth noting that the code does not seem to be part of the Linux kernel, and the vulnerability is specific to the kernel. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to this specific CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any implementation of the vulnerability, and it does not seem to be related to the Linux kernel. However, it's always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it does not contain any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, if this code is intended to be used in a kernel or a high-security context, it's recommended to perform a thorough security audit to ensure it meets the required security standards.
