 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-5157 vulnerability because it mishandles IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution. This might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI. The code is using the load_TR_desc() and load_LDT() functions which are not properly handling the IRET faults.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to version 4.1.6 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper handling of IRET faults in the load_TR_desc() and load_LDT() functions to prevent the vulnerability.
3. Use a secure method to handle NMIs that occurred during userspace execution. 
4. Review and update the code to ensure it is secure and follows best practices for handling NMIs.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly handling IRET faults and that the MSR_*STAR and related registers are properly set.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other security issues.  The code should be reviewed by a security expert to ensure that it is secure and follows best practices.  The code should be
