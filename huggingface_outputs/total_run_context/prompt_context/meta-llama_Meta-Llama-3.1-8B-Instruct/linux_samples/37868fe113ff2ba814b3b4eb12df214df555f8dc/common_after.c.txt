 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack due to the mishandling of IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.1.6 or later.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2015-5157 to the kernel.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle IRET faults and NMIs. 
4. Regularly update and patch the kernel to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5157
CVE Description:
arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform mishandles IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution, which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI.  Code Sample:
void foo(int x) {
	int y = x;
	if (x > 10) {
		y = x +
