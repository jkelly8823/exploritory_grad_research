 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-5157 vulnerability. This is because the code mishandles IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution, which might allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI. The code is specifically vulnerable because it does not properly handle the MSR_*STAR and related registers, which are critical in handling NMIs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the MSR_*STAR and related registers are properly set and handled in the code.
2. Implement proper handling for IRET faults in processing NMIs that occurred during userspace execution.
3. Review and update the code to ensure it is compliant with the latest security patches and guidelines. 4. Consider using a secure coding framework to help identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the code. 5. Perform a thorough code review to ensure that all potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. 6. Implement a testing plan to verify that the code is free from vulnerabilities and functions as expected. 7. Consider using a code analysis tool to help identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 8. Review and update the code to ensure it is compliant with
