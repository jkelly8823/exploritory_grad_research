 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1179 because it does not properly handle page faults for huge pages. The pmd_none_or_clear_bad function is called without checking if the pmd is valid, which can lead to a denial of service (host OS crash) when KVM is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the pmd is valid before calling pmd_none_or_clear_bad.
2. Use a more robust method to handle page faults for huge pages, such as using a separate function to handle this case.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle pmds, such as using a lock to protect access to the pmd.
