 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1179 because it uses the pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad function which is related to the vulnerability. This function is used to handle page faults for huge pages, which is the same functionality that is exploited in the CVE-2012-1179 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.3.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure version of the pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad function that is not vulnerable to CVE-2012-1179.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, such as validating user input and checking for administrative access to the guest OS. 4. Consider using a different virtualization technology that is not affected by this vulnerability. 5. Regularly update and patch the Linux kernel to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 6. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 7. Use a code review process to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited. 8. Consider using a secure coding framework that can help identify and
