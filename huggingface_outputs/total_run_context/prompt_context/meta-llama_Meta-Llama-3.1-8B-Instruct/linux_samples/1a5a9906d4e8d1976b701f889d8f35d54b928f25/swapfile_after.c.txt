 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1179 because it does not properly handle page faults for huge pages. The pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad function is called, but it does not check if the page is a huge page. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering a page fault for a huge page.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the page is a huge page before calling pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad.
2. Handle page faults for huge pages properly by checking if the page is a huge page and taking the necessary actions.
