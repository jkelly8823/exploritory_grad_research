 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability CVE-2012-1179. The vulnerability is related to the handling of huge pages in the Linux kernel, specifically in the pmd_none_or_clear_bad function. However, the code sample does not contain any calls to this function or any related code that could potentially lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2012-1179 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested before deployment.  The code sample appears to be a simple loop that continues to the next iteration if the pmd_none_or_clear_bad function returns true, which does not seem to be related to the vulnerability.  Further analysis of the code and its context is required to determine if it is actually vulnerable.  It is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire program and the Linux kernel version being used.  Additionally, it is recommended to use a static analysis tool to scan the code for potential vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to test the
