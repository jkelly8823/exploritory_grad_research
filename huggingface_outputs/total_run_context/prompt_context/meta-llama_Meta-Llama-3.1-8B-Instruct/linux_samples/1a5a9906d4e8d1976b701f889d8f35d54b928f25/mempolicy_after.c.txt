 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1179 because it does not properly handle page faults for huge pages. The pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad function is called, which can lead to a denial of service (host OS crash) when KVM is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.3.1 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to handle page faults for huge pages properly.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to KVM. 
4. Review and update the code to ensure it is compatible with the latest kernel version.  ```python
def check_vulnerability(code):
    # Define the vulnerability pattern
    pattern = r"pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad\(pmd\)"
    
    # Search for the pattern in the code
    import re
    matches = re.findall(pattern, code)
    
    # Check if the pattern is found
    if matches:
