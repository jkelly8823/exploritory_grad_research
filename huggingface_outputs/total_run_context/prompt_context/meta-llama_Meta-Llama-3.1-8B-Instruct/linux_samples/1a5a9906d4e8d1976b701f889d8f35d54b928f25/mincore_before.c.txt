 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-1179 because it allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) by leveraging administrative access to the guest OS. This is due to the pmd_none_or_clear_bad function and page faults for huge pages. The code calls mincore_unmapped_range when pmd_none_or_clear_bad returns true, which can lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.3.1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent guest OS users from causing a denial of service. 
3. Review and update the code to handle page faults for huge pages securely.  ```
