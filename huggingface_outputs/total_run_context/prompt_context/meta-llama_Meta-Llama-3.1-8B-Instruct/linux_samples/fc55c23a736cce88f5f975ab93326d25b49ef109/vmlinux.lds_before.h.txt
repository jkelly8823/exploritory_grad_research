 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the Spectre-BHB attack. The code is focused on defining various constants and macros for ARM architecture, including memory management unit (MMU) discard, procedure information, vectors, and TCM (Tightly Coupled Memory) definitions. There is no indication of any code that would allow an attacker to influence mispredicted branches or obtain sensitive information through cache speculation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the Spectre-BHB attack. However, it is essential to note that the code is likely intended for use in a specific context, such as embedded systems or firmware, and may have other security considerations that are not addressed here. It is crucial to review the code in its entirety and consider any additional security requirements or constraints before deploying it in a production environment.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-23960
CVE Description:
Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history
