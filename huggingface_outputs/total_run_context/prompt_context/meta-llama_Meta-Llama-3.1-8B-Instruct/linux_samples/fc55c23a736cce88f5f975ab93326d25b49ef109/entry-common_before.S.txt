 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to be related to the specified vulnerability (CVE-2022-23960). The vulnerability is related to cache speculation on certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors, which is not directly related to the assembly code provided. The code seems to be handling an exception entry point, and there is no indication of cache speculation or branch prediction manipulation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is essential to note that the code is in assembly language, and the vulnerability is related to hardware-level cache speculation. Therefore, the code itself cannot be fixed, but the system or hardware it is running on should be updated to address the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-23960
CVE Description:
Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.
