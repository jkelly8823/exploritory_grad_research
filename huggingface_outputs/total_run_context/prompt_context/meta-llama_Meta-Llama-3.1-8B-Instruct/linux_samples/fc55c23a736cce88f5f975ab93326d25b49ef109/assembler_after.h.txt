 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Spectre-BHB due to the use of the `mcr` instruction, which can be exploited by an attacker to influence mispredicted branches and obtain sensitive information. The `mcr` instruction is used in the `dsb` and `isb` macros, which are not properly restricted, allowing an attacker to access the Branch History Buffer (BHB).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use the `dmb` instruction instead of `mcr` in the `dsb` and `isb` macros. This will prevent an attacker from accessing the BHB and reduce the risk of Spectre-BHB attacks. Additionally, the code should be updated to use the `msr` instruction to set the `c7` register, as `mcr` is not necessary in this case. The updated code should look like this:
```c
.macro	dsb, args
	dmb	ish
	.endm

.macro	isb, args
	msr	c7, c10, 4
	dmb	ish
	.endm
