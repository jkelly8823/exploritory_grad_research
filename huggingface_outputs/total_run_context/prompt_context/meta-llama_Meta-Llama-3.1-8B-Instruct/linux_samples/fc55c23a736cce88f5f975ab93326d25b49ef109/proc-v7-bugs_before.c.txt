 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a mitigation for the Spectre-BHB vulnerability. It checks the CPU type and implements the necessary workarounds for each type. The code also checks the Auxiliary Control Register (AUXCR) for the Spectre v2 vulnerability and initializes the Spectre mitigation if necessary.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is a correct implementation of the Spectre-BHB mitigation. However, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest CPU types and workarounds. Additionally, the code should be reviewed regularly to ensure it remains effective against new vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-23960
CVE Description:
Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.  Code Sample:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 1024
