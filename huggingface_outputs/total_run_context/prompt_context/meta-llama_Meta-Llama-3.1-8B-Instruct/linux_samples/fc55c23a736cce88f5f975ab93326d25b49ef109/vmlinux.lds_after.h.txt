 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Spectre-BHB due to the use of the Branch History Buffer (BHB) in the ARM_VECTORS macro. The BHB is used to store branch history information, which can be exploited by an attacker to influence mispredicted branches and obtain sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the BHB by setting the `BHB` bit in the `CCTL` register to 0.
2. Use a secure branch predictor, such as the `BPIALL` predictor, which is designed to mitigate Spectre-BHB attacks.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as cache allocation and deallocation, to prevent attackers from exploiting the BHB. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-23960
CVE Description:
Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.  This vulnerability is present in
