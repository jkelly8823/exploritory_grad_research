 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's security module, and it uses the call_int_hook and call_void_hook functions to invoke security hooks. These functions are used to call the corresponding security functions, such as userns_create and ipc_permission, which are defined elsewhere in the code. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes, that would be related to the listed CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is following the best practices and security guidelines. Additionally, the code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected and does not contain any other vulnerabilities.  ```bash
