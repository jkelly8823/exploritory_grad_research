 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-10879 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly check for the existence of the xattr block before attempting to verify its checksum. This can lead to a use-after-free error when renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the xattr block exists before attempting to verify its checksum.
2. Use a more robust method to verify the existence of the xattr block, such as checking the block's magic number and size.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle xattr blocks, such as using a separate data structure to store the block's metadata.
