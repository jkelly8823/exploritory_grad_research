CVE_ID:CVE-2011-1076
CVE Description:
net/dns_resolver/dns_key.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by not providing a valid response to a DNS query, as demonstrated by an erroneous grand.centrall.org query, which triggers improper handling of error data within a DNS resolver key.  Code Sample:  int dns_query(struct dns_resolver *res, struct
