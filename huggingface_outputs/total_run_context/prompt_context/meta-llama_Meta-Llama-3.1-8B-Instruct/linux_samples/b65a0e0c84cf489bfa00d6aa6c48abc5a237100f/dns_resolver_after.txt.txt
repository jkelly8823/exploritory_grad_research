 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2011-1076. This is because the code is attempting to read a dns_resolver key from userspace, which can be manipulated by a remote DNS server to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) if the DNS server does not provide a valid response to a DNS query.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle the case where the DNS server does not provide a valid response to a DNS query. This can be achieved by adding error checking code to handle the case where the DNS query fails. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a more secure method of reading the dns_resolver key from userspace, such as using a secure protocol like DNS over TLS. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-1076
CVE Description:
net/dns_resolver/dns_key.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by not providing a valid response to a DNS query, as demonstrated by an erroneous grand.c
