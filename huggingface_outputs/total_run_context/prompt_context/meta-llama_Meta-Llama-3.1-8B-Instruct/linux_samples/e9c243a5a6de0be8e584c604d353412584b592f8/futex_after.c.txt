 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-3153 vulnerability. This is because the code does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted FUTEX_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification. The lines 14, 20, and 25 are the lines where the vulnerability is present. Line 14 checks if the two uaddrs are the same, but this check is not sufficient for shared futexes. Line 20 checks if the keys match, but this check is also not sufficient. Line 25 checks if the keys match again, but this check is also not sufficient.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the two futex addresses are different for both private and shared futexes.
2. Use a more robust method to compare the keys, such as using a secure hash function.
3. Remove the redundant checks and use a single check to ensure that the two futex addresses are different.
