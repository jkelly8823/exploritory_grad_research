 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the futex_requeue function vulnerability. The futex_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted FUTEX_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification. The code is vulnerable because it does not check if the futex addresses are different before requeueing the futex.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the futex addresses are different before requeueing the futex.
2. Use a secure hash function to hash the futex addresses.
3. Implement additional checks to prevent unsafe waiter modification.
