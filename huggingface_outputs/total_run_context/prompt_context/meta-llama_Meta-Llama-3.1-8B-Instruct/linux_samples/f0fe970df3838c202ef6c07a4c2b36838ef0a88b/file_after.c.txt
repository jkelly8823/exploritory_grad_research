 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The ecryptfs_privileged_open function is vulnerable to a stack memory consumption bug due to recursive pagefault handling. This is caused by crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames. The ecryptfs_mmap function is called in the ecryptfs_open function, which is vulnerable to this bug. The bug is triggered when the lower_file->f_op->mmap function returns an error, causing the generic_file_mmap function to fail, leading to recursive pagefault handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of lower_file->f_op->mmap before calling generic_file_mmap to prevent recursive pagefault handling.
2. Implement a check to prevent recursive mounting of ecryptfs, as mentioned in the code comment.
3. Update the ecryptfs_privileged_open function to handle the error case properly to prevent stack memory consumption. 
4. Consider using a more secure method to handle mmap calls, such as using a custom mmap function that checks for /proc pathnames.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
