 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-1583 vulnerability because it uses the generic_file_mmap function which can be exploited by a local user to gain privileges or cause a denial of service. This is due to the fact that the generic_file_mmap function does not properly handle crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the generic_file_mmap function with a custom implementation that properly handles crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent recursive pagefault handling.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to generic_file_mmap, such as the ecryptfs_mmap function.  VULNERABLE: YES
