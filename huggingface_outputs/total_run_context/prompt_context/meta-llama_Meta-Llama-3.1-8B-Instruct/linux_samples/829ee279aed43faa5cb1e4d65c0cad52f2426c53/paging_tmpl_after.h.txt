 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an MMU potential stack buffer overrun due to incorrect index calculation during page walking. This is because the code does not properly traverse guest pagetable entries to resolve a guest virtual address. The BUG_ON statement is used to prevent the code from proceeding when the walker->level is less than 1, but this does not address the underlying issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Review the code for proper handling of guest pagetable entries and ensure that the index calculation is correct.
2.  Consider using a more robust method for traversing guest pagetable entries, such as using a recursive function or a loop that properly handles the pagetable hierarchy.
3.  Ensure that the BUG_ON statement is removed or modified to handle the case where walker->level is less than 1 in a more robust manner. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-12188
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c in the Linux kernel through 4.13.5, when nested virtualisation is used, does not properly traverse guest pagetable entries to resolve a guest virtual address, which allows L1
