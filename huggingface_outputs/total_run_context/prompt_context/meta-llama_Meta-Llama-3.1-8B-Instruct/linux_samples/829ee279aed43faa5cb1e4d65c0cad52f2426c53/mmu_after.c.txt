 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-12188. The code appears to be a helper function for determining whether a given GPT entry is the last one at a particular level, and does not involve any nested virtualization or pagetable traversal that could lead to a stack buffer overrun.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be a safe and well-structured implementation of the described functionality. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.  ```bash
