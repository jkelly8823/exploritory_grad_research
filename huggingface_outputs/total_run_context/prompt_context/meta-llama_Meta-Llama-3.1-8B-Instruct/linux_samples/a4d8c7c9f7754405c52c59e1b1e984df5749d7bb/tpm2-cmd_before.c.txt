 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2015-5327 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to an out-of-bounds memory read in the x509_decode_time function in x509_cert_parser.c, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be handling TPM (Trusted Platform Module) data and does not involve any x509 certificate parsing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential vulnerabilities.
