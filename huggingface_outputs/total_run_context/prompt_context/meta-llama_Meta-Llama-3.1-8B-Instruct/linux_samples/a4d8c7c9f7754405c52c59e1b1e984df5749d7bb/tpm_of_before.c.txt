 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain the x509_decode_time function, which is the specific function that is vulnerable to the out-of-bounds memory read. The code does appear to be related to memory allocation and copying, but it does not contain the vulnerable function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain the vulnerable function, so no fixes are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that memory allocation and copying operations are properly handled. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5327
CVE Description:
Out-of-bounds memory read in the x509_decode_time function in x509_cert_parser.c in Linux kernels 4.3-rc1 and after.  The x509_decode_time function is used to decode the time field in an X.509 certificate. The function does not properly validate the time field, allowing an attacker to read memory outside the bounds of the certificate. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. 
Code Sample:
		if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86_64)) {
