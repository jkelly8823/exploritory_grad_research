 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data. The mix_pool_bytes function is called with user-space data, which could be used by programs early in the boot sequence before the seed is sufficiently generated. This could potentially allow an attacker to predict the random seed and compromise the system's security.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the mix_pool_bytes function is only called with data that has been sufficiently generated and is not user-space data.
2. Consider using a more secure method to generate the random seed, such as using the get_random_bytes function.
3. Ensure that the kernel version is 4.17-rc1 or later to address this vulnerability. 4.17-rc1 and later versions of the kernel have fixed this weakness. 4.17-rc1 and later versions of the kernel have fixed this weakness. 4.17-rc1 and later versions of the kernel have fixed this weakness. 4.17-rc1 and later versions of the kernel have fixed this weakness. 4.17-rc1 and later versions of the kernel have fixed this weakness. 4.
