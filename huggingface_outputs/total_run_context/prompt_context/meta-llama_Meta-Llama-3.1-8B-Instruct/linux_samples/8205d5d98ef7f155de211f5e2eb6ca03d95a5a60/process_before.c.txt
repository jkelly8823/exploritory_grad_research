 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack due to the missing check for the Facility Unavailable exception. This allows a local user to read vector registers of other users' processes. The code checks if the MSR_VSX bit is set, but it does not check if the MSR_VSX bit is set in conjunction with the MSR_FP and MSR_VEC bits. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by setting the MSR_VSX bit and then accessing vector registers of other users' processes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the MSR_VSX bit is set in conjunction with the MSR_FP and MSR_VEC bits before accessing vector registers.
2. Implement the missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check to prevent the corruption of vector registers.
3. Consider using a more secure method to access vector registers, such as using a secure register access mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-15030
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel through 5.2.14 on the powerpc platform, a local user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility Unavailable exception.
