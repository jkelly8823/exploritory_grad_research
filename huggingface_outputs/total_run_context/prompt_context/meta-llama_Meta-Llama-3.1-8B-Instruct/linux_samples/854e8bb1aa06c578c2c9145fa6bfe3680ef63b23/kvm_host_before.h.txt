VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from the /proc/<pid>/maps file by reading the memory ranges of arbitrary processes.

Code Sample:
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <string.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/stat.h>
	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <sys/mman.h>

	int main() {
		int fd = open("/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY);
		if (fd == -
