 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds write due to the use of the min function to limit the allocation size. However, the min function does not prevent the allocation of memory beyond the bounds of the msg_buckets. This can lead to a heap out-of-bounds write if the allocation size exceeds the bounds of the msg_buckets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the kmem_cache_zalloc function to allocate memory from the msg_buckets, which will prevent the allocation of memory beyond the bounds of the msg_buckets.
2. Use the kmem_cache_alloc function with the GFP_KERNEL flag to allocate memory from the msg_buckets, which will prevent the allocation of memory beyond the bounds of the msg_buckets.
3. Increase the size of the msg_buckets to prevent the allocation of memory beyond its bounds. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2021-26708. This vulnerability is related to the AF_VSOCK implementation in the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
