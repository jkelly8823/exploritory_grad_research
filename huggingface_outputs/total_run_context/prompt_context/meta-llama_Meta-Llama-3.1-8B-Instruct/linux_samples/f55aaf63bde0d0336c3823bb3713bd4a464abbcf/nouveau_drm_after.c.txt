 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free situation. In the nouveau_drm_device_fini function, the nouveau_cli_fini function is called on the cli pointer before the kfree(cli) call. This means that the cli pointer is being freed before the nouveau_cli_fini function is called, which can lead to a use-after-free situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix is to move the nouveau_cli_fini function call after the kfree(cli) call. This will ensure that the cli pointer is not freed until after the nouveau_cli_fini function has been called. The corrected code should look like this:
```
mutex_lock(&cli->mutex);
	kfree(cli);
	nouveau_cli_fini(cli);
	mutex_unlock(&cli->mutex);
```
This will prevent the use-after-free situation and ensure that the cli pointer is properly cleaned up.
