 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The function mtk_adsp_ipc_set_data() does not check if the pointer data is NULL before assigning it to ipc->private_data. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when mtk_adsp_ipc_get_data() is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a NULL check for the data pointer before assigning it to ipc->private_data.
2. Consider using a safer method to store and retrieve data, such as using a struct with a valid data pointer and a flag to indicate if the data is valid.
