 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-10757 vulnerability because it does not properly handle DAX Huge Pages. The `is_swap_pmd()` and `pmd_trans_huge()` checks are not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The `extent == HPAGE_PMD_SIZE` check is also relevant, as it indicates that the code is dealing with huge pages, which are a key component of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add additional checks to ensure that the code is not dealing with DAX Huge Pages when the `is_swap_pmd()` and `pmd_trans_huge()` checks are true.
2. Consider using a more robust locking mechanism to prevent race conditions when dealing with huge pages.
3. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling the `need_rmap_locks` variable.
