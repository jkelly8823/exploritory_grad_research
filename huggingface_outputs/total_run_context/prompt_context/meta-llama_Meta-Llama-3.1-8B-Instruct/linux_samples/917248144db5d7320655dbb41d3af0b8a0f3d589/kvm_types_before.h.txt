 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that would allow a process in the guest kernel to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. The code appears to be a header file that defines an enumeration and includes other header files. There is no indication of any functionality that would enable the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly maintained and updated to prevent any future vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly tested and validated to prevent any issues that may arise from its use.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3016
CVE Description:
In a Linux KVM guest that has PV TLB enabled, a process in the guest kernel may be able to read memory locations from another process in the same guest. This problem is limit to the host running linux kernel 4.10 with a guest running linux kernel 4.16 or later. The problem mainly affects AMD processors but Intel CPUs cannot be ruled out.
