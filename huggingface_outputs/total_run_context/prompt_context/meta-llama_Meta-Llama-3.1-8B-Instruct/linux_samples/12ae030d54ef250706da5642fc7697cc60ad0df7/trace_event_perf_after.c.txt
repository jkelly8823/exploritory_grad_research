 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2930 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict access to the perf subsystem. The condition `perf_paranoid_tracepoint_raw()` is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access, as it only checks if the perf subsystem is enabled, but does not check if the user has the necessary permissions. This allows a local user to enable function tracing via a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a permission check to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the perf subsystem. This can be done by calling the `capable()` function with the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.
2. Remove the `perf_paranoid_tracepoint_raw()` check, as it is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a capability-based access control system, to restrict access to the perf subsystem.
