 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2930 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict access to the perf subsystem. The condition `perf_paranoid_kernel() &&!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)` is not sufficient to prevent a local user from enabling function tracing via a crafted application. This is because the `capable` function checks for the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, but a local user can still exploit the vulnerability if they have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `perf_paranoid_kernel()` check, as it is not necessary to prevent the vulnerability.
2. Use a more restrictive check, such as `!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) &&!capable(CAP_SYS_PTRACE)`, to ensure that only root can enable function tracing.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate permission check for the perf subsystem, to prevent this type of vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
