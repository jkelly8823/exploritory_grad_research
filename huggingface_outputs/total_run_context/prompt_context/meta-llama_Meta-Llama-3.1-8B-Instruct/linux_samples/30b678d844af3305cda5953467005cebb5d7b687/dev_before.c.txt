 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3412 because it does not properly handle the VLAN protocol. When a packet with VLAN protocol is received, the code does not check if the VLAN tag is present before accessing the encapsulated protocol. This allows an attacker to trigger a denial of service by sending crafted TCP packets with a small MSS value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the VLAN tag is present before accessing the encapsulated protocol.
2. Use a safe function to access the encapsulated protocol, such as `vlan_get_protocol`.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle VLAN protocols, such as using a separate function to handle VLAN packets.
