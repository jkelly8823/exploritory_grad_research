 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3412 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the sfc driver in the Linux kernel and is triggered by crafted TCP packets. The code sample appears to be related to setting kernel sock attributes and data center bridging netlink operations, which do not seem to be related to the sfc driver or TCP packet processing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3412 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure.
