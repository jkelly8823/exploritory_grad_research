 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds access due to the lack of validation of the size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update. This is a result of the function xfrm_replay_verify_len not validating the size data properly. The function checks if the length of the replay state ESN is equal to the ulen, but it does not check if the length is within the valid range. This can lead to a heap-based out-of-bounds access when the length is greater than the valid range.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the length of the replay state ESN before using it.
2. Check if the length is within the valid range before using it.
3. Use a secure function to allocate memory for the replay state ESN. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7184
CVE Description:
The xfrm_replay_verify_len function in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 does not validate certain size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update, which allows local users to obtain root privileges or cause a denial
