 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds access due to the lack of validation of the size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update. The xfrm_replay_verify_len function does not validate the size data, which allows an attacker to manipulate the size data and cause a heap-based out-of-bounds access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update by checking if the length of the replay state ESN is equal to the expected length.
2. Use a secure function to allocate memory for the replay state ESN to prevent heap-based out-of-bounds access.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to prevent attackers from predicting the location of the heap-based out-of-bounds access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7184
CVE Description:
The xfrm_replay_verify_len function in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 does not validate certain size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update, which allows local users
