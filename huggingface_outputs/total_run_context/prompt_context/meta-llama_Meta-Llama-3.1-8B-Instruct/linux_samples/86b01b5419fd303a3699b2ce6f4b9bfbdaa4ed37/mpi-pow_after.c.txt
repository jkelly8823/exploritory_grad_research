 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) due to the lack of memory allocation for limb data in the mpi_powm function. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel (CVE-2016-8650). The code attempts to handle the case where the exponent is zero, but it does not properly allocate memory for the result, leading to a potential denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Allocate memory for the result using mpi_resize before attempting to access it.
2. Check the return value of mpi_resize to ensure that memory allocation was successful.
3. Consider using a more robust memory management approach to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```c
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted /proc/self/maps read operation.

Code Sample:
	struct seq_file *m;
	struct mm_struct *mm;
	struct vm_area_struct *vma;
	struct rb_node *
