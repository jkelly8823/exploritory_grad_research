CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2929
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 3.12.2 does not properly use the get_dumpable function, which allows local users to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers via a crafted application, related to kernel/ptrace.c and arch/ia64/include/asm/processor.h.

Code Sample:
	int get_dumpable(struct mm_struct *
