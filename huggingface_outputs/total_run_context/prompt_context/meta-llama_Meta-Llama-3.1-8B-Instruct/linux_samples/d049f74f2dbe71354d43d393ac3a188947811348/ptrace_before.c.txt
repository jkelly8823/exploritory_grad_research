 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2929 vulnerability because it does not properly use the get_dumpable function. The get_dumpable function is not called with the correct context, which allows an attacker to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call the get_dumpable function with the correct context, which is the current task's mm context.
2. Ensure that the get_dumpable function is called before the ptrace_has_cap check to prevent potential information disclosure. 
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle ptrace restrictions, such as using a separate function to check for ptrace capabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000116
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.14.12 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the netfilter subsystem, where a netfilter hook is not properly cleared when a netfilter hook is removed, allowing an attacker to access freed memory.

Code Sample:
	struct nf_hook_ops *ops = nf_hook_get(&net->nf_hooks, hooknum);
	if (ops
