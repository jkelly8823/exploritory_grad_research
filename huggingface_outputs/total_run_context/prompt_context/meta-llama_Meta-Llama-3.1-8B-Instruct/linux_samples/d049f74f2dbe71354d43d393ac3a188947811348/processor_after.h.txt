 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2929 vulnerability because it does not properly use the get_dumpable function. The function is used to set the "don't zap registers" flag, but it is not used consistently throughout the code. In the if statement, the function is used to check if the current process has the SUID_DUMP_USER privilege, but it is not used to set the flag. This inconsistency allows an attacker to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the get_dumpable function consistently throughout the code to set the "don't zap registers" flag.
2. Remove the if statement and always set the flag to avoid the vulnerability.
3. Use a more secure method to check the privileges of the current process, such as using the capget function. 
4. Consider using a secure method to allocate the scratch area, such as using the kmalloc function with the GFP_KERNEL flag. 5. Consider using a secure method to handle the scratch registers, such as using the copy_to_user function to copy the registers to user space. 6. Consider using
