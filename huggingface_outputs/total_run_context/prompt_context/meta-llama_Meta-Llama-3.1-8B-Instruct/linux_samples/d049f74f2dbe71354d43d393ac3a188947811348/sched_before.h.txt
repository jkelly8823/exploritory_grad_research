 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of the get_dumpable function or the ptrace restrictions. However, it does define the MMF_DUMPABLE and MMF_DUMP_SECURELY flags, which are related to the dumpable state of a process. This suggests that the code is intended to be used in conjunction with the get_dumpable function, but it does not contain any vulnerable code itself.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be a header file that defines constants and does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the get_dumpable function and the ptrace restrictions in the kernel to ensure that they are properly implemented and secure. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code that uses these flags to ensure that it is properly handling the dumpable state of a process.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2929
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 3.12.2 does not properly use the get_dumpable function, which allows local users to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers via a crafted application, related
