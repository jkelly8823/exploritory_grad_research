 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any direct implementation of the get_dumpable function or the ptrace restrictions. However, it does define constants for dumpable flags and mm flags, which are related to the vulnerability. This suggests that the code is part of a larger system that may be vulnerable, but the provided snippet itself does not contain the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Review the code that calls the set_dumpable and get_dumpable functions to ensure that they are implemented correctly and follow the intended security restrictions. Additionally, consider adding input validation and sanitization to prevent potential attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2929
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 3.12.2 does not properly use the get_dumpable function, which allows local users to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers via a crafted application, related to kernel/ptrace.c and arch/ia64/include/asm/processor.h.  Code Sample:
int get_dumpable(struct mm_struct *mm) {
    return mm->dumpable;
}
int set_dumpable(struct mm_struct *mm, int value
