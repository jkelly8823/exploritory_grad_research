 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2929 vulnerability because it does not properly use the get_dumpable function. The function is used to set the "don't zap registers" flag, but it is not used correctly. The function is called twice, once to set the flag and once to check if the flag is set. However, the check is done in an if statement, which means that the flag is not set if the check fails. This allows local users to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the if statement and always set the "don't zap registers" flag.
2. Use a single call to get_dumpable(current->mm) to set the flag and check if it is set.
3. Use a more secure method to set the flag, such as using a separate function to set the flag and then checking if it is set.
