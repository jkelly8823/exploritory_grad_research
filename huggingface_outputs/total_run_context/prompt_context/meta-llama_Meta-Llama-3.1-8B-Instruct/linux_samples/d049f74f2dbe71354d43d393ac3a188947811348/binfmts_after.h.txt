 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any direct implementation of the get_dumpable function or its usage in a way that would allow a local user to bypass ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers. The code appears to be related to stack area protections and does not seem to be related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2929.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
