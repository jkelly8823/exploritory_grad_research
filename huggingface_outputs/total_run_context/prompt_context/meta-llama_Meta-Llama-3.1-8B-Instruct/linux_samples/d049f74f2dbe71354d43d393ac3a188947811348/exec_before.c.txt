 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2929 vulnerability. The get_dumpable function is not properly used, allowing local users to bypass intended ptrace restrictions or obtain sensitive information from IA64 scratch registers. This is due to the fact that the return value of get_dumpable is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the dumpable flag.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the return value of get_dumpable to ensure it is within the expected range.
2. Use the get_dumpable function correctly by checking the return value against the expected values.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle dumpable flags, such as using a whitelist of allowed values. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000364
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.14.12 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the netfilter subsystem, where a netfilter hook is not properly cleared when a netfilter hook is removed, allowing a local attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service.

Code Sample:
	struct nf_hook_state *hook_state = nf_hook_get_state(hook);
