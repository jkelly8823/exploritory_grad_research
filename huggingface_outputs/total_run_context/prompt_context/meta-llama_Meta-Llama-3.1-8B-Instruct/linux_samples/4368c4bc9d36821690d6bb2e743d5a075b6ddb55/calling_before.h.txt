 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the Spectre Variant 1 speculative execution side channel vulnerability (CVE-2019-1125). This is because the code uses the `PUSH_AND_CLEAR_REGS` macro, which can be used to speculatively access memory. The `call stackleak_erase` instruction can be used to access memory that is not intended to be accessed, potentially leading to information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a more secure method of accessing memory, such as using a secure function call.
2. Apply the security update released by Microsoft on July 9, 2019, which addresses the vulnerability through a software change that mitigates how the CPU speculatively accesses memory.
3. Consider using a microcode update from the device OEM to further mitigate the vulnerability.  Note that this is not required for this specific vulnerability.  However, it may be beneficial for other vulnerabilities.  Consult with the OEM for more information.  Note that this is not a requirement for this specific vulnerability.
