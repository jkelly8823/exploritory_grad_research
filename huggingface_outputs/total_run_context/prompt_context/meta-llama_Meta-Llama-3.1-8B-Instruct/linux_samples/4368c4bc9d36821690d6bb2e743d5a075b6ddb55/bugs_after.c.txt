VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10, 15-20, 25-30, 35-40, 45-50, 55-60, 65-70, 75-80, 85-90, 95-100
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a Linux kernel module that deals with Spectre v1 and v2 vulnerabilities. The code is vulnerable to Spectre v1 and v2 attacks because it does not properly mitigate the speculative execution side channel vulnerability. The code uses various mitigation techniques such as usercopy barriers, swapgs barriers, and SMAP to prevent speculative access to user data. However, the code is not properly configured to enable these mitigation techniques, making it vulnerable to Spectre v1 and v2 attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Enable the FENCE_SWAPGS_USER and FENCE_SWAPGS_KERNEL features to prevent user entry from speculatively skipping swapgs.
2. Configure the SMAP feature to provide full mitigation against speculative kernel access to userspace.
3. Use the PTI (Page Table Isolation) feature to prevent speculative access to user data in the L1 cache.
4. Update the code to properly enable the mitigation
