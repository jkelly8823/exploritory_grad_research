 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-1000255 because it allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. This is due to the fact that the kernel stack pointer is set to the value of r1 from the signal frame, which can be controlled by the attacker. The exception handling does produce an oops and a panic, but only after kernel memory has been overwritten.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to set the kernel stack pointer, such as using a secure register or a stack pointer that is not controlled by the attacker.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent the attacker from overwriting kernel memory.
3. Consider using a different exception handling mechanism that does not rely on the kernel stack pointer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000255
CVE Description:
On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (PowerPC8 or later) a user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the
