 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-7975 vulnerability. This is because the do_umount function does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for do_remount_sb calls that change the root filesystem to read-only. The code checks if the root filesystem is not read-only and then calls do_remount_sb to remount it read-only. This allows a local user to cause a denial of service by making certain unshare system calls, clearing the /MNT_LOCKED flag, and making an MNT_FORCE umount system call.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability before calling do_remount_sb.
2. Use the correct capability check to ensure that the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is required for do_remount_sb calls that change the root filesystem to read-only.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate function to handle the remounting of the root filesystem. This would allow for more fine-grained control over the capabilities required for this operation. 4. Review and update the code to ensure that it is in line with the latest security guidelines and best practices. 5.
