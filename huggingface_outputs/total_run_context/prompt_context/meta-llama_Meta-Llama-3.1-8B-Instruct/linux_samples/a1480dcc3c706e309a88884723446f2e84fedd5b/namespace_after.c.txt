 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-7975 vulnerability. The do_umount function does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for do_remount_sb calls that change the root filesystem to read-only. This allows a local user to cause a denial of service by making certain unshare system calls, clearing the / MNT_LOCKED flag, and making an MNT_FORCE umount system call.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is required for do_remount_sb calls that change the root filesystem to read-only.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate function to handle the remounting of the root filesystem, and requiring the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for that function. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all necessary checks are in place to prevent this type of vulnerability.  Consider using a code review tool to help identify potential issues.  Additionally, consider implementing a feature to automatically detect and prevent this type of vulnerability in the future.  This could be done by adding a check in the do_remount_sb function to ensure that the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is required
