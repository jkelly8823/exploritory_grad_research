 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly relates to the described vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's handling of supplemental group memberships and POSIX ACLs, which is not present in this code sample. The code appears to be a header file that declares functions and macros related to user namespaces, but it does not contain any implementation that could be vulnerable to the described issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described issue. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire Linux kernel and ensure that it is properly implemented and tested to prevent any potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8989
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 3.17.4 does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships in certain namespace scenarios, which allows local users to bypass intended file permissions by leveraging a POSIX ACL containing an entry for the group category that is more restrictive than the entry for the other category, aka a "negative groups"
