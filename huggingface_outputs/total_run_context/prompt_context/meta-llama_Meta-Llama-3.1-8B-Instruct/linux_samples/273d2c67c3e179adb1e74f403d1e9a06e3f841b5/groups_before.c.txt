 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 vulnerability because it does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships. This is evident in the line where it checks if the current user has the CAP_SETGID capability. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as it does not take into account the POSIX ACL containing an entry for the group category that is more restrictive than the entry for the other category.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships. This can be achieved by checking the group category in the POSIX ACL and ensuring that it is not more restrictive than the entry for the other category. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the "negative groups" issue by checking for the presence of a group category in the POSIX ACL that is more restrictive than the entry for the other category. This can be done by adding a check for the presence of a group category in the POSIX ACL and ensuring that it is not more restrictive than the entry for the other category.
