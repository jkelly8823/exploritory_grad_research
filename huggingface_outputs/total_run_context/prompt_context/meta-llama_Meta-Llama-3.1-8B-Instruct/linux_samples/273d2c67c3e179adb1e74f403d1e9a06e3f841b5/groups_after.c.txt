 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 issue. This is because the code does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships in certain namespace scenarios. The issue arises when a POSIX ACL contains an entry for the group category that is more restrictive than the entry for the other category. This allows local users to bypass intended file permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Ensure that the code properly restricts dropping of supplemental group memberships in all namespace scenarios.
2.  Review the POSIX ACLs to ensure that they do not contain entries that are more restrictive than the entry for the other category.
3.  Implement additional checks to prevent local users from bypassing intended file permissions. 
4.  Update the kernel to the latest version to ensure that the CVE-2014-8989 issue is fixed.  This can be done by running the command "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" on a Debian-based system.  The exact command may vary depending on the Linux distribution being used.  It is also recommended to reboot the system after updating the kernel to ensure that the changes take effect.  VULNERABILITY LIST
