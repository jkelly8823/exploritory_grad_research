 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 issue because the userns_may_setgroups function is not properly restricting the dropping of supplemental group memberships. The function is returning true for any user namespace, which allows local users to bypass intended file permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the userns_may_setgroups function to properly restrict the dropping of supplemental group memberships based on the user namespace.
2. Ensure that the function returns false for user namespaces that do not allow group membership changes. 
3. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent unauthorized group membership changes.  ```
