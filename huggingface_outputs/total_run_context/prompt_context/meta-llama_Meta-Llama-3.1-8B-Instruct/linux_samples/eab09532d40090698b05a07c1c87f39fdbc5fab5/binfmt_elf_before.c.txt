 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the offset2lib patch vulnerability as described in CVE-2017-1000370. The code is using the MAP_FIXED flag when loading an executable file, which can allow an attacker to execute a PIE binary with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings, nullifying the protection of the offset2lib patch.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the MAP_FIXED flag when loading an executable file.
2. Use the MAP_GROWSDOWN flag to ensure that the stack grows down to the lowest possible address.
3. Use the RLIMIT_STACK to limit the stack size to prevent the stack from growing down to 0x80000000. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000370
CVE Description:
The offset2lib patch as used in the Linux Kernel contains a vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings then the stack occupies the address 0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above 0x40000000 nullifying the protection of the offset2lib patch. This affects Linux Kernel
