 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The code is related to the Linux Kernel and defines constants for core dump usage and ELF executable page size. It also defines the base location for PIE loads, which is dependent on the architecture. The code does not contain any code that would allow a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings, or that would cause the stack to be grown down to 0x80000000.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities and does not require any fixes. However, it is worth noting that the code is related to the Linux Kernel and may be subject to other vulnerabilities or issues not described in the provided CVEs. It is always a good idea to review and test code thoroughly before deployment.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000370
CVE Description:
