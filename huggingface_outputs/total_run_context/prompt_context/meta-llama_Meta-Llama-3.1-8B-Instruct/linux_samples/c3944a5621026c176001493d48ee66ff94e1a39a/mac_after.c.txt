 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code snippet is related to wireless networking and key management, but it does not seem to be using the 802.11 standard in a way that would allow an adversary to decrypt selected fragments. The code is checking for the presence of a peer and flushing the fragments cache during key installation, which is a security measure to ensure all fragments belong to the same key. This is actually a mitigation against the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it's working as intended. Additionally, the code could benefit from more comments and documentation to improve its maintainability and readability.  ```
