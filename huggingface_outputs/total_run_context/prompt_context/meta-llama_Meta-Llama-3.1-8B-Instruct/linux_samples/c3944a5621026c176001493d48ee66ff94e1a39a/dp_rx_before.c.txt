 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24587 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the encryption of fragmented frames. The __skb_queue_purge function is used to clear the rx_frags queue, but it does not ensure that all fragments are encrypted under the same key. This allows an adversary to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the __skb_queue_purge function with caution and ensure that all fragments are properly encrypted before clearing the queue.
2. Consider using a more secure method to clear the queue, such as using the __skb_queue_empty function to check if the queue is empty before clearing it.
3. Implement additional security measures to ensure that all fragments are encrypted under the same key, such as using a secure encryption protocol like AES.  VULNERABLE: YES
