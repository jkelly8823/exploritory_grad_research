 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free error due to the fact that the `nontransmitted_profile` pointer is freed before the `elems` structure is returned. This can lead to a crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the `kfree(nontransmitted_profile);` line to after the `elems` structure is returned to prevent the use-after-free error.
2. Consider using a smart pointer or a reference-counted object to manage the `nontransmitted_profile` pointer and avoid the need for manual memory management.
3. Review the code to ensure that all memory allocations and deallocations are properly synchronized to prevent use-after-free errors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-42719
CVE Description:
A use-after-free in the mac80211 stack when parsing a multi-BSSID element in the Linux kernel 5.2 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by attackers (able to inject WLAN frames) to crash the kernel and potentially execute code.  This vulnerability is present in the code sample provided.  The vulnerability
