 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the `pdu->StructureSize2` variable. In the line `if (smb2_rsp_struct_sizes[command]!= pdu->StructureSize2)`, the code does not check if `pdu->StructureSize2` is within the valid range of indices for the `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes` array. This could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read if `command` is not a valid index for the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on `pdu->StructureSize2` to ensure it is within the valid range of indices for the `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes` array.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced binary search tree, to store the `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes` array, which would eliminate the need for bounds checking. 
3. Review the code to ensure that `command` is always a valid index for the `smb2_rsp_struct_sizes` array. If not, consider adding additional validation or error handling to
