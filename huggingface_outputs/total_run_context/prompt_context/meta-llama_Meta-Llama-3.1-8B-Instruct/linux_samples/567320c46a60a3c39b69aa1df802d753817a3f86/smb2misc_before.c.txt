 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the `shdr->StructureSize` variable. This can lead to a crash or leak of internal kernel information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on the `shdr->StructureSize` variable to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed size.
2. Consider using a safer function to copy data from the `shdr` structure, such as `memcpy` with bounds checking.
3. Review the `check_smb2_hdr` function to ensure it does not introduce any additional vulnerabilities.
