 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value. This is because the kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Review the kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c to ensure it accurately calculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure.
2.  Implement a check to prevent large gfn values from being used.
3.  Consider using a more robust memory mapping mechanism to prevent memory corruption. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2014-3601 as it does not contain the kvm_iommu_map_pages function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
