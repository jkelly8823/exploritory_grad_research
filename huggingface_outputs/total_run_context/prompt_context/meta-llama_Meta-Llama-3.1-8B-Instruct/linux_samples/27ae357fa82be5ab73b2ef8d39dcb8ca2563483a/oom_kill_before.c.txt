 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. This is due to the oom_reaper's unmap_page_range() being called synchronously with the oom killer's exit_mmap() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Ensure that the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is not cleared before munlocking.
2.  Implement a mechanism to prevent the oom_reaper's unmap_page_range() from being called synchronously with the oom killer's exit_mmap().
3.  Consider using a lock to protect the critical section where the oom_reaper's unmap_page_range() is called.

CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000200
CVE Description:
The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's
