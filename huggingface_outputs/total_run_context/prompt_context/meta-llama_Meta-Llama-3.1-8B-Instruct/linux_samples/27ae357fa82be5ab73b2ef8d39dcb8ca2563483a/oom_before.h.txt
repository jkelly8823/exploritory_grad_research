 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference or out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The code snippet is a simple return statement and does not interact with the Linux Kernel's memory management functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet is clean and does not require any modifications. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues.

CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000200
CVE Description:
The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM
