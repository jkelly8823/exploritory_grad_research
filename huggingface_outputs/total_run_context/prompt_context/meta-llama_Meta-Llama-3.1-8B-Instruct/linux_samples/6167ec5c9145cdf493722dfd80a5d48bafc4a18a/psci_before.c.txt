 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 because it uses speculative execution and indirect branch prediction. The switch statement in line 6 uses indirect branch prediction, which can be exploited by an attacker to disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the switch statement with a direct jump or a table-based approach to eliminate indirect branch prediction.
2. Consider using a secure execution mode, such as ARMv8.3, which includes features to mitigate speculative execution attacks.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as bounds checking and input validation, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.

Code Sample:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y;
