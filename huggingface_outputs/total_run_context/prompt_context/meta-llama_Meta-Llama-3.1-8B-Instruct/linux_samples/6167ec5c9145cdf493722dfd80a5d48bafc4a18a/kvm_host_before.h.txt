 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5715 vulnerability. This is because it uses the local_daif_restore function without checking if the DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ flag is set. This can lead to a side-channel analysis attack, allowing an attacker with local user access to disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the value of the DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ flag before calling local_daif_restore.
2. Use a secure method to restore the DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ flag, such as using a secure restore function.
3. Consider using a secure programming model that does not rely on speculative execution. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5195
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's keyring implementation handled the keyring's maximum size. An attacker able to establish a network connection to a system running the kernel could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.

Code Sample:
struct keyring *keyring = keyring_alloc(NULL, 0, 0, NULL, 0);
if (keyring) {
    keyring_add
