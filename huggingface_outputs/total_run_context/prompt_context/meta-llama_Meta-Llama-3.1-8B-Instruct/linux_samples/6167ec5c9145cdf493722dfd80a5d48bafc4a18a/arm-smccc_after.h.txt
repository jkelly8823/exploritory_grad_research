 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability. This is due to the use of indirect branch prediction in the ARM_SMCCC_SMC_32 function. The ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 macro also uses the ARM_SMCCC_FAST_CALL function which is also vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability. This is because the function uses indirect branch prediction to call the ARM_SMCCC_SMC_32 function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a different method for indirect branch prediction, such as using a direct branch or a branchless approach. Additionally, the ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 macro should be modified to use a different method for calling the ARM_SMCCC_SMC_32 function. This can be achieved by using a direct call or a branchless approach. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
