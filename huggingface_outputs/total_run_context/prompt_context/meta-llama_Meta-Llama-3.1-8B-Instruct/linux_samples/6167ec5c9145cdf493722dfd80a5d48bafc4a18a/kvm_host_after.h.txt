 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5715 vulnerability because it does not properly restore the DAIF (Data Access Flag) state. This allows an attacker with local user access to potentially disclose sensitive information through a side-channel analysis. The function `kvm_arm_harden_branch_predictor` checks if the branch predictor is hardened, but it does not address the DAIF state restoration issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the DAIF state is properly restored before executing any sensitive code. This can be achieved by calling `local_daif_restore(DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ)` with the correct context.
2. Consider using a more secure method to restore the DAIF state, such as using a secure restore function provided by the CPU architecture.
3. Review the code to ensure that all sensitive operations are properly protected against side-channel attacks. VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.

Code Sample:
int foo(int x) {
