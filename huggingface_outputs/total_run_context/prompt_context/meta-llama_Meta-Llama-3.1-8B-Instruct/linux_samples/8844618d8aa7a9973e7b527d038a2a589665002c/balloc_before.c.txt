 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free error in the ext4_ext_remove_space() function. This is due to the fact that the ext4_lock_group() function is called after the goto statement, which can lead to a situation where the group descriptor is freed before it is locked, resulting in a use-after-free error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the ext4_lock_group() function call before the goto statement to ensure that the group descriptor is locked before it is potentially freed.
2. Consider using a lock to protect the group descriptor from being freed while it is being accessed. 
3. Review the ext4_ext_remove_space() function to ensure that it is not vulnerable to use-after-free errors.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-1353
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ext4 filesystem code. A use-after-free is possible in ext4_ext_remove_space() function when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image.

Code Sample:
	if (ext4_has_inline_data(inode)) {
		ext4_set_inode_state(inode, EXT4_STATE_INLINE_DATA);
