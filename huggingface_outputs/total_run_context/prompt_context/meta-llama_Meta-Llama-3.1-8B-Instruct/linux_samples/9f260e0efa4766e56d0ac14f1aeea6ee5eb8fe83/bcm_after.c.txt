 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the creation of a publicly accessible file with a filename containing a kernel memory address. This allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information about kernel memory use by listing this filename. The sprintf function is used to create the filename, which is then used to create a proc entry. This is a classic example of a vulnerability known as a "procfs leak".
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function to create the filename, such as snprintf or asprintf, to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a more secure method to create the proc entry, such as using a unique identifier instead of a kernel memory address.
3. Consider using a more secure procfs implementation, such as one that uses a hash table to store proc entries instead of a linear list.

CVE_ID:CVE-2010-4565
CVE Description:
The bcm_connect function in net/can/bcm.c (aka the Broadcast Manager) in the Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.36 and earlier creates a publicly accessible file with a filename containing a
