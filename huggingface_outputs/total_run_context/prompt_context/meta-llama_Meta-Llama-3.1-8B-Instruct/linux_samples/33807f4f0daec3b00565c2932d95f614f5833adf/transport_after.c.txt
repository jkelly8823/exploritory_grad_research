 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer. This is due to the cifs_iovec_write function not properly handling uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes. The vulnerability is present in the line where the iov->iov_len is set to rqst->rq_pagesz. This line does not check if the requested number of bytes is less than the actual number of bytes that can be written, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the requested number of bytes is not greater than the actual number of bytes that can be written.
2. Use a safer function to handle uncached write operations, such as cifs_iovec_write_safe.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle write operations, such as using a buffer with a fixed size.
