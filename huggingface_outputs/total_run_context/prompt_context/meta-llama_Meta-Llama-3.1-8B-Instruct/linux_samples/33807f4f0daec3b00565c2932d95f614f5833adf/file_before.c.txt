 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) due to the lack of proper handling of uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel (CVE-2014-0069).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that has fixed this vulnerability (e.g., 3.13.6 or later).
2. Implement proper handling of uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, such as by checking the return value of __generic_file_aio_write and handling the case where it returns an error.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a lock-free data structure or a more robust synchronization mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial
