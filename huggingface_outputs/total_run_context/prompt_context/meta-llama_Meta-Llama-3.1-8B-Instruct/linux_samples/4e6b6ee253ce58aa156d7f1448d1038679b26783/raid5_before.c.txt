CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5697
CVE Description:
The get_bitmap_file function in drivers/md/md.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 does not initialize a certain bitmap data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a GET_BITMAP_FILE ioctl call.  Code Sample: 
int get_bitmap_file(struct mddev *mddev, struct bitmap_info *bi)
{
	struct mddev_private *priv = mddev->private;
	struct bitmap *bitmap = priv->
