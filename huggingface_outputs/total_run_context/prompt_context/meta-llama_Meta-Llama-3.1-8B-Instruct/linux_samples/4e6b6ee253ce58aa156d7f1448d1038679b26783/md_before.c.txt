 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The get_bitmap_file function is not present in this code snippet, and the code does not perform any operations that would allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and validated. Additionally, the use of kmalloc with GFP_NOIO may not be the best choice in this context, as it may lead to memory allocation failures. Consider using a more robust memory allocation mechanism, such as kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5697
CVE Description:
The get_bitmap_file function in drivers/md/md.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 does not initialize a certain bitmap data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a GET_BITMAP_FILE ioctl call.  Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	int y = 10;
	int z = x + y;
	int
