 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the denial of service vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6213. The code snippet appears to be a header file that declares a function name_to_dev_t, but does not contain any implementation or usage of MS_BIND mount system calls.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the name_to_dev_t function to ensure it does not contain any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to review the usage of this function in the rest of the codebase to ensure it is being used correctly and securely.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2016-6213, CVE_Description:fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9 does not restrict how many mounts may exist in a mount namespace, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and deadlock) via MS_BIND mount system calls, as demonstrated by a loop that triggers exponential growth in the number of mounts.  ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
