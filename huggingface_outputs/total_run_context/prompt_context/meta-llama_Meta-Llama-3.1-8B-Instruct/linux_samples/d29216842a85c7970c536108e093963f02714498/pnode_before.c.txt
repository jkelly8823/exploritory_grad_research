 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption and deadlock) due to the lack of restriction on the number of mounts in a mount namespace. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel before 4.9, as described in CVE-2016-6213. The code snippet provided does not implement any checks to prevent the exponential growth of mounts, which can lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a mechanism to restrict the number of mounts in a mount namespace, such as a counter or a limit on the number of mounts. This can be achieved by adding a check before adding a new mount to the namespace, and returning an error if the limit is reached. Additionally, consider upgrading to a Linux kernel version that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-6213
CVE Description:
fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9 does not restrict how many mounts may exist in a mount namespace, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and deadlock) via MS_BIND mount system calls, as demonstrated by a loop that
