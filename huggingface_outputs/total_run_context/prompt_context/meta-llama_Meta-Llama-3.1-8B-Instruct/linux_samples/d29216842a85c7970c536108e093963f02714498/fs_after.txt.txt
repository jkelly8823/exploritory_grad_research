 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not contain any explicit checks or restrictions on the number of mounts that may exist in a mount namespace. This makes it vulnerable to the denial of service (memory consumption and deadlock) attack described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement a mechanism to restrict the number of mounts that may exist in a mount namespace, such as a counter that increments each time a mount is performed and decrements when a mount is unmounted. This can be achieved by adding a check in the mount system call to ensure that the number of mounts does not exceed the maximum allowed value. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent exponential growth in the number of mounts. This can be done by monitoring the number of mounts and triggering a warning or error when the number of mounts approaches the maximum allowed value. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.14.12 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the net/sched/act_pedit.c file, where a pedit action is not properly initialized, leading to a use-after-free bug when the action is deleted.
