 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a symlink attack due to the way it handles symlinks. The may_follow_link function checks for unsafe situations, but it does not prevent the creation of symlinks to sensitive files. This allows an attacker to create a symlink to a sensitive file and then access it, potentially leading to elevated privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Set sysctl_protected_symlinks to 1 to enable protection against symlink attacks.
- Implement additional checks in the may_follow_link function to prevent the creation of symlinks to sensitive files.
- Consider using a more secure method to handle symlinks, such as using a whitelist of allowed symlinks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2000-1134
CVE Description:
Multiple shell programs on various Unix systems, including (1) tcsh, (2) csh, (3) sh, and (4) bash, follow symlinks when processing << redirects (aka here-documents or in-here documents), which allows local users to overwrite files of other users via a symlink attack.
