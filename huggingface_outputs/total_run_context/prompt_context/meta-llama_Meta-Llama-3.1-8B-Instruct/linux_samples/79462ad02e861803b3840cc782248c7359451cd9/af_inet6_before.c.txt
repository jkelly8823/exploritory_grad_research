 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-8543 vulnerability because it does not validate the protocol identifiers for certain protocol families. The line "err = -ESOCKTNOSUPPORT;" sets the error code to -ESOCKTNOSUPPORT, which is a valid error code for the ESOCKTNOSUPPORT error. However, the code does not check if the protocol identifier is valid before setting the error code. This allows a local user to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the protocol identifiers for certain protocol families before setting the error code.
2. Use a secure method to handle the error code, such as using a try-except block to catch and handle the error.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the protocol identifiers, such as using a whitelist of allowed protocol identifiers.  ```python
