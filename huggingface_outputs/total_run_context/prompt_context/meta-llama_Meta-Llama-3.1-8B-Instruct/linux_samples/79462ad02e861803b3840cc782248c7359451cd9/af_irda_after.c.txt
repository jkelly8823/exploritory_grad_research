 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided checks for valid protocol and network identifiers before proceeding. It validates the protocol identifier against the SK_PROTOCOL_MAX limit and also checks if the network is the initial network. This prevents potential NULL function pointer dereferences and system crashes that could be caused by invalid protocol identifiers. However, it does not explicitly check for SOCK_RAW applications, which could potentially be used to execute a crafted application and gain privileges. Nevertheless, the code's current implementation does not directly address the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8543.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement additional checks to validate the protocol family for SOCK_RAW applications.
2.  Consider using a more robust validation mechanism to ensure that the protocol family is correctly validated.
3.  Review the code's error handling to ensure that it properly handles invalid protocol identifiers and network identifiers.  ```c

CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3, when CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR is enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack corruption and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging
