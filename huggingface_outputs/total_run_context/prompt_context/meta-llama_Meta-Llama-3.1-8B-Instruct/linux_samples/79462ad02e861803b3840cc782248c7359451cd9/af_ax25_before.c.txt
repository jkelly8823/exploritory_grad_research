 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-8543 vulnerability because it does not validate the protocol identifier for the SOCK_RAW socket type. This allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially gain privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the protocol identifier for the SOCK_RAW socket type before proceeding with the rest of the code.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle SOCK_RAW sockets, such as using a separate protocol family or implementing additional security checks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-8543
CVE Description:
The networking implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.3.3, as used in Android and other products, does not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
