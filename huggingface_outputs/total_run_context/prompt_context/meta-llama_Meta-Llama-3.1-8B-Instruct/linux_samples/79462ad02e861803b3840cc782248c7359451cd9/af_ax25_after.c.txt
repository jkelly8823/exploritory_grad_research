 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-8543 vulnerability because it does not validate the protocol identifier for the SOCK_RAW protocol family. The vulnerability allows a local user to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the protocol identifier for the SOCK_RAW protocol family by checking if it is within the valid range for SOCK_RAW.
2. Implement additional validation for the SOCK_RAW protocol family to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed protocols, to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-8543
CVE Description:
The networking implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.3.3, as used in Android and other products, does not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL function pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges by leveraging CLONE_NEWUSER support to execute a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
