 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1000204 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the DMA-mapping subsystem without properly checking for the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities. The DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED and DMA_ATTR_OVERWRITE flags are used to hint the DMA-mapping subsystem, but they do not provide any security checks. An attacker with the required capabilities can exploit this vulnerability to copy kernel heap pages to userspace.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities before using the DMA-mapping subsystem.
2. Use the DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED and DMA_ATTR_OVERWRITE flags only when necessary and with proper security checks.
3. Consider using a more secure DMA-mapping subsystem implementation that provides better security guarantees. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000204
CVE Description:
Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to
