 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code does not involve an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. The code is related to DMA operations and does not seem to be related to the Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested before deployment. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential security issues related to DMA operations.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000204
CVE Description:
Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/t
