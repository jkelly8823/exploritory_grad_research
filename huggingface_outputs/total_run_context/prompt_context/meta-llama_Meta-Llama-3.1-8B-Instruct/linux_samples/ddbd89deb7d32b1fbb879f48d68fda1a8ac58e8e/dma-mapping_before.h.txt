 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1000204 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED attribute, which is a privileged operation. An attacker with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities can exploit this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED attribute from the code.
2. Ensure that the code is running with the least privilege necessary to perform its tasks.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the DMA device. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000204
CVE Description:
Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824 already.
