 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data. The line `crng->init_time = jiffies - CRNG_RESEED_INTERVAL - 1;` is the source of the vulnerability. This line is allocating data for the seed before it is sufficiently generated, which can be exploited by programs early in the boot sequence.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the allocation of seed data to a later point in the boot sequence, after the seed has been sufficiently generated.
2. Use a more secure method for generating random seed data, such as using the `get_random_bytes()` function.
3. Ensure that the `CRNG_RESEED_INTERVAL` variable is set to a value that is sufficient to generate a strong random seed. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1108
CVE Description:
kernel drivers before version 4.17-rc1 are vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data. Programs, early in the boot sequence, could use the data allocated for the seed before it was sufficiently generated.  The vulnerability is due to the fact
