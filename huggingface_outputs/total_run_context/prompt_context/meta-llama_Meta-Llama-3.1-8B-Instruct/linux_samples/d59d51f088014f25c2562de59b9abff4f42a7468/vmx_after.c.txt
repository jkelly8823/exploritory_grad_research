 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-1000407 vulnerability. The code is setting the bits in the bitmaps to 0xff, which is equivalent to -1 in binary, indicating that all bits are set. This is not a flooding of the diagnostic port 0x80, which is the condition described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that it is correctly setting the bits in the bitmaps as intended. Additionally, it is recommended to consider using a more explicit and readable way to set the bits, such as using a loop or a bitwise OR operation.  The memset function is being used to set the bits in the bitmaps, which may not be the most efficient or readable way to do so.  Consider using a more explicit and readable way to set the bits, such as using a loop or a bitwise OR operation.  This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.  It is also recommended to consider using a more secure way to set the bits, such as using a secure memset function or
