 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-12817 vulnerability because it uses the mtspr and mfspr instructions to access the SPRN_SPRG_THREAD and SPRN_SRR1 registers. These instructions can be used to read/write to one another's virtual memory under certain conditions via an mmap above 512 TB. This is a bug in the Linux kernel before 5.1.15 for powerpc systems.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 5.1.15 or later.
2. Use the tlbie instruction to invalidate the TLB entries before accessing the SPRN_SPRG_THREAD and SPRN_SRR1 registers.
3. Use the mtspr and mfspr instructions with caution and ensure that the registers being accessed are not mapped to the same virtual memory space.
