 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The vulnerability is specific to the powerpc architecture and involves the use of mmap above 512 TB, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to this issue. However, if this code is intended to be used on a powerpc system, it is recommended to ensure that the system is properly configured and that the necessary patches are applied to prevent this vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-12817
CVE Description:
arch/powerpc/mm/mmu_context_book3s64.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.15 for powerpc has a bug where unrelated processes may be able to read/write to one another's virtual memory under certain conditions via an mmap above 512 TB. Only a subset of powerpc systems are affected.  Code Sample: 
int is_crashing_cpu(int cpu) {
	return crashing_cpu >= 0;
}
