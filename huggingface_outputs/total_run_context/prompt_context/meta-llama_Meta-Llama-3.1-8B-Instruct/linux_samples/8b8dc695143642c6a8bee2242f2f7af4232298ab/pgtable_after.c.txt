The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is checking for conditions that would indicate a hugepage collapse or split, and it is also checking for serialization of the huge page. However, the code is not accessing or modifying virtual memory in a way that would allow unrelated processes to read/write to each other's virtual memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the described CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is free from vulnerabilities.  The code may benefit from additional comments or documentation to explain the purpose and behavior of the functions and variables used.  Additionally, the code may benefit from additional error checking and handling to ensure that it can properly handle unexpected input or edge cases.  It is also a good practice to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and updates.  The code may also benefit from additional testing and validation to ensure it is working as expected in different scenarios.  It is also a good practice to follow the best practices for coding and security to ensure the code is secure and reliable
