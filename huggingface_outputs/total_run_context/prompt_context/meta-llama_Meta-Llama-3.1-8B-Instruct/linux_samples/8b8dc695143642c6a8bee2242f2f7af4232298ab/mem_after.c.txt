 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the mmap function or any related memory mapping operations. The code appears to be focused on calculating and setting up maximum zone PFNs (Physical Frame Numbers) for different zones in the system. The suspected vulnerability, CVE-2019-12817, is related to a bug in the Linux kernel's mmu_context_book3s64.c file, which is not present in this code sample. Therefore, the code is not vulnerable to this specific CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that would introduce the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12817. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it does not introduce any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested for any potential issues related to memory management and virtual memory access.  The code should be reviewed for any potential issues related to the use of the min and max functions, as well as the calculation of the max_zone_pfns values.  It is also recommended to ensure that the code is properly configured and compiled for the specific powerpc system it is intended
