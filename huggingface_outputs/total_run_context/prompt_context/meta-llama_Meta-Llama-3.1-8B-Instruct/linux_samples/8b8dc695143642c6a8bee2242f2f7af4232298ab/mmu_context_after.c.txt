 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free (UAF) bug. In the realloc_context_ids function, when an error occurs, the code frees the allocated ids but does not update the ctx->extended_id array. This can lead to accessing freed memory when the function returns.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the ctx->extended_id array when freeing the allocated ids in the error handling loop.
2. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as returning an error code and letting the caller handle it, instead of using a goto statement.
