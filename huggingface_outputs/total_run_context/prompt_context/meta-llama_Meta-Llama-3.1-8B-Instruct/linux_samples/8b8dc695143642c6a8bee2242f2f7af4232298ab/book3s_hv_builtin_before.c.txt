 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12817. The vulnerability is specific to the arch/powerpc/mm/mmu_context_book3s64.c file in the Linux kernel and involves an mmap above 512 TB, which is not present in the provided code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is related to the vulnerability, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is worth noting that the code sample appears to be a snippet from the Linux kernel, and it is possible that other parts of the kernel may be vulnerable to this issue. Further analysis would be required to determine the full extent of the vulnerability.  ```python
