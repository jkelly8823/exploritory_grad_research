 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-12817 vulnerability because it uses the SAVE_4GPRS and SAVE_2GPRS macros to save registers, which can lead to a bug where unrelated processes may be able to read/write to one another's virtual memory under certain conditions via an mmap above 512 TB. This is because the macros do not properly handle the saving of registers in the context of the powerpc architecture.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the SAVE_4GPRS and SAVE_2GPRS macros to properly handle the saving of registers in the context of the powerpc architecture.
2. Use a more secure method to save registers, such as using a secure register save instruction.
3. Consider using a different architecture or a different method to save registers if the current method is not secure. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling the saving of registers in all contexts. 
5. Consider using a code review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 
6. Update the code to use a secure method to save registers, such as using a secure register save instruction. 
7. Test
