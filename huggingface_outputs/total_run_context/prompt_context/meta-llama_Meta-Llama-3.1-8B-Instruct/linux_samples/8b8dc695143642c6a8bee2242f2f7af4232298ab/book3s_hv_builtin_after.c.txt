 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described issue. The code appears to be related to PowerPC architecture and is focused on handling TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) operations, which is not directly related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12817.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire kernel and ensure that it is not indirectly vulnerable due to interactions with other code. Additionally, it is recommended to keep up-to-date with the latest kernel patches and updates to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed.  ```python
