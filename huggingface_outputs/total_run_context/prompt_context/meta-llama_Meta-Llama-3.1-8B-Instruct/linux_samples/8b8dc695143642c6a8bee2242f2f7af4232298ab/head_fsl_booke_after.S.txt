 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The vulnerability is specific to the Linux kernel's powerpc architecture and involves the use of mmap above 512 TB, which is not present in this code sample. The code appears to be related to exception handling and system call interrupts, which is unrelated to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities specific to the powerpc architecture and the use of mmap. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested for any potential security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-12817
