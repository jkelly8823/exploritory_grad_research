 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10, 20-30
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS infinite loop) due to the H_CEDE hypercall during the existence of a suspended transaction. This is because the guest OS users can cause a denial of service by making a H_CEDE hypercall during the existence of a suspended transaction.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  The code should be modified to handle the H_CEDE hypercall during the existence of a suspended transaction. This can be done by adding a check to see if a transaction is suspended before making the H_CEDE hypercall.
2.  The code should be modified to handle exceptions and interrupts while executing host real mode code while in guest MMU context. This can be done by adding a mechanism to handle exceptions and interrupts, such as a spin loop or a more sophisticated exception handling mechanism.
3.  The code should be modified to restore the guest decrementer after handling exceptions and interrupts. This can be done by adding a line to restore the guest decrementer after handling exceptions and interrupts.
4.  The code should be modified to load up FP state after handling exceptions and interrupts. This can be
