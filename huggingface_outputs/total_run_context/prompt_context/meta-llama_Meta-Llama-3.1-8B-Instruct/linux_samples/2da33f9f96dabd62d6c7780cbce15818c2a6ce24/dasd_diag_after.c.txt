 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (system crash) due to the mishandling of the case of four page-table levels in the fork implementation of the Linux kernel. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2016-2143) that can be exploited by a local user through a crafted application. The code uses inline assembly to interact with the Linux kernel, which makes it difficult to analyze and debug. The vulnerability is present in the __dia250 function, where the assembly code is executed without proper error handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (e.g., 4.5 or later).
2. Use a safer alternative to inline assembly, such as a library function that provides the same functionality.
3. Implement proper error handling in the __dia250 function to prevent the system crash. This can be done by checking the return value of the assembly code and handling any errors that may occur. 
4. Consider using a more secure programming language or framework that is less prone to vulnerabilities like this one. 5. Review and update the code to ensure that it is
