 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (system crash) due to the mishandling of the case of four page-table levels in the fork implementation. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel before 4.5 on s390 platforms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.5 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2016-2143 to the kernel source code.
3. Consider using a more robust page-table management implementation to prevent similar issues in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-2143
CVE Description:
The fork implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.5 on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to arch/s390/include/asm/mmu_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h. 
Code Sample:
static inline int init_new_context(struct task_struct *tsk,
				   struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	cp
