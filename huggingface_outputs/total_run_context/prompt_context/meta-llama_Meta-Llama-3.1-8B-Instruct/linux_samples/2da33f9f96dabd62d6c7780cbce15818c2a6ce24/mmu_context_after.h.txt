 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to arch/s390/include/asm/mmu_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h. This is due to the mishandling of the case of four page-table levels in the fork implementation of the Linux kernel before 4.5 on s390 platforms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.5 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to handle the case of four page-table levels correctly.
3. Consider using a more robust page-table allocation mechanism to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 5. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited. 6. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard to ensure that the code is written securely. 8. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date. 9.
