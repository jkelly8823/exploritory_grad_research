 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to arch/s390/include/asm/mmu_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h. This is due to the mishandling of the case of four page-table levels in the fork implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.5 on s390 platforms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.5 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to handle the case of four page-table levels correctly.
3. Use a more robust memory management mechanism to prevent system crashes.  ```python
