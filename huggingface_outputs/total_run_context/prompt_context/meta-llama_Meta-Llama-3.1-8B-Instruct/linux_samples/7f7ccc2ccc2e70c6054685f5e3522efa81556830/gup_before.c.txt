 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1120 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly check for the VM_IO flag when the write flag is set. If the VM_IO flag is not set, but the write flag is set, the code will return -EFAULT, but this does not prevent an attacker from causing a denial of service by mmap()ing a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory containing command line arguments.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the VM_IO flag when the write flag is set, and return an error if it is not set.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle the write flag, such as using a separate flag or a more secure check. 
3. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles all possible scenarios and edge cases. 4. Consider using a more secure method to handle the FUSE-backed file, such as using a separate flag or a more secure check. 5. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles all possible scenarios and edge cases. 6. Consider using a more secure method to handle the /proc/<pid>/cmdline
