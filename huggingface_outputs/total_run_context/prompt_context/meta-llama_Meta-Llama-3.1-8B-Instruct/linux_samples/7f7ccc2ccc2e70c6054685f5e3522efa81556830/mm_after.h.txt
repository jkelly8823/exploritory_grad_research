EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to cause utilities to block indefinitely or for some controlled time. The code snippet appears to be a part of a function that handles vm_faults and does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to exploit the CVE-2018-1120 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to exploit the CVE-2018-1120 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities.
