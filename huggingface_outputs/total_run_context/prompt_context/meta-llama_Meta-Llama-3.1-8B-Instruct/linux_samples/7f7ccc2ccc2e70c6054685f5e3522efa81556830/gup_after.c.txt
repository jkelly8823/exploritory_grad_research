 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1120 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where a process is trying to write to a FUSE-backed file that is mapped into its memory. The code checks if the file is anonymous, but it does not check if the file is FUSE-backed. This allows an attacker to cause utilities to block indefinitely or for a controlled time.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to see if the file is FUSE-backed before allowing write access.
2. If the file is FUSE-backed, return an error instead of allowing the write operation to proceed.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle write operations to FUSE-backed files. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1120
CVE Description:
A flaw was found affecting the Linux kernel before version 4.17. By mmap()ing a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory containing command line arguments (or environment strings), an attacker can cause utilities from psutils or procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which makes a read()
