 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the input string 'chap_r'. The function 'chap_binaryhex_to_asciihex' does not check the length of the input string 'chap_r' before copying it to the destination string 'dst'. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string 'chap_r' is longer than the destination buffer 'dst'.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on the input string 'chap_r' to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use a safer function like'strncpy' to copy the input string 'chap_r' to the destination string 'dst'.
3. Consider using a more secure function like'snprintf' to format the destination string 'dst' and prevent buffer overflow. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-14633
CVE Description:
A security flaw was found in the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the ISCSI target code in the Linux kernel in a way an authentication request from an ISCSI initiator is processed. An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow and smash up to 17 bytes of
