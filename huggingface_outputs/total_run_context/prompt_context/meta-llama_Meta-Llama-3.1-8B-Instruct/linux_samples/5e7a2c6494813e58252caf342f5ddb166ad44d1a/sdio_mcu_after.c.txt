 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This vulnerability is related to the 802.11 standard and can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. The code does not properly validate the A-MSDU flag, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
2. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag to ensure that only authorized packets are processed.
3. Consider using a secure protocol to encrypt and authenticate network packets to prevent tampering and eavesdropping. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames
