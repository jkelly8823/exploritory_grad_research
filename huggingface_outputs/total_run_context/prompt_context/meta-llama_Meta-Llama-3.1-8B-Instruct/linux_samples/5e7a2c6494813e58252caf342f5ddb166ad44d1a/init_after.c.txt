VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3156
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the emulation of the FPU (Floating Point Unit) instructions. This occurred when the guest was using the FPU in a way that caused the host's FPU to be used, leading to a potential information leak. This flaw allowed a guest user to leak host memory contents to the guest.

Code Sample:
