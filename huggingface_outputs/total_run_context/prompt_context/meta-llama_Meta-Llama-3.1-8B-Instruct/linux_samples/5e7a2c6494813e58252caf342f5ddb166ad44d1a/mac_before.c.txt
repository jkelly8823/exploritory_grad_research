VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3156
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the emulation of the x86 "SGDT", "SLDT", "SGDT", and "STR" instructions. This occurred when a guest attempted to write to these registers while the host's CPU was in a specific mode. This flaw allowed a guest user to crash the host or, potentially,
