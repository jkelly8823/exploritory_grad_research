 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Use a secure method to parse the rate information, such as using a validated and sanitized input.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure function to handle the rate information. 
4. Review the code to ensure that all potential buffer overflow attacks are mitigated. 
5. Consider using a code review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU
