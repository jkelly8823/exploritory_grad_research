 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This vulnerability is related to the 802.11 standard and can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. The code does not properly validate the A-MSDU flag, which can lead to a buffer overflow when processing the QoS header field.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the A-MSDU flag in the QoS header field to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
2. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag to ensure that only authorized packets are processed.
3. Use a secure coding practice to prevent buffer overflow attacks, such as using a safe string copy function or checking the length of the input data before processing it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is
