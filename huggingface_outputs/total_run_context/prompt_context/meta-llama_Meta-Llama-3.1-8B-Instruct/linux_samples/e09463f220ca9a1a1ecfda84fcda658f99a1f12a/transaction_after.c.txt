 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-10883 because it contains a double check for the same condition. This can lead to a denial of service and a system crash. The condition being checked is jh->b_transaction == transaction && jh->b_jlist!= BJ_Metadata. This condition is checked twice in the same scope, which can cause an out-of-bounds write in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata().
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the double check should be removed. The condition should be checked only once. The corrected code should look like this:
```
if (jh->b_transaction == transaction &&
    jh->b_jlist!= BJ_Metadata) {
	jbd_lock_bh_state(bh);
	J_ASSERT_JH(jh, jh->b_transaction!= transaction ||
		    jh->b_jlist == BJ_Metadata);
	jbd_unlock_bh_state(bh);
}
``` 
```
