 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the ext4 filesystem code, specifically the ext4_update_inline_data() function. The code appears to be iterating over xattr entries and calculating their total size. This does not seem to be related to the CVE-2018-10880 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is properly handling xattr entries and their sizes to prevent potential issues.  ```c
