The provided code snippet does not appear to be related to the 802.11 standard or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). The code seems to be a part of a Linux driver for a specific hardware (IPQ8074), and it does not contain any code that could be exploited to inject arbitrary network packets. The function `ath11k_hw_ipq8074_mac_from_pdev_id` appears to be a simple mapping function between PCI device index and hardware MAC index.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE description. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, the code could benefit from comments and documentation to improve its maintainability and readability.  ```c
#include <linux/bitops.h>
#include <linux/bitfield.h>

#include "hw.h"
#include "core.h"
#include "ce.h"
#include "hif.h"

/* Map from pdev index to hw mac index */
