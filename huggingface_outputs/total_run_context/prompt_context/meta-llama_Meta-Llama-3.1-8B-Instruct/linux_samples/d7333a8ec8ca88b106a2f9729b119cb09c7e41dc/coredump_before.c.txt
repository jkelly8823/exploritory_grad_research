 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field, which can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is properly authenticated.
2. Implement a mechanism to validate the QoS header field before processing it.
3. Consider using a secure protocol to encrypt and authenticate network packets. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.  ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
