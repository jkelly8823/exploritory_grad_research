 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that the code properly checks for the presence of the A-MSDU flag before processing the QoS header field.
3. Consider using a secure protocol for authentication and encryption, such as WPA3. 
4. Regularly update the code to ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest security patches and best practices.  ```bash
