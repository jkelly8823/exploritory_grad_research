 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This vulnerability is related to the 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). The code does not properly validate the length of the input buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow when processing the A-MSDU flag.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2.  Validate the length of the input buffer to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
3.  Use secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support
