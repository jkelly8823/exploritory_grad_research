 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 11-15, 21-25, 31-35, 41-45
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential information disclosure attack. The code does not properly validate the integrity of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field, which can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. This vulnerability is related to the CVE-2020-24588.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the integrity of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field before processing the packet.
2. Implement proper authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the network.
3. Regularly update and patch the system to ensure that all known vulnerabilities are addressed.
