 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the use of kmalloc and dma_alloc_coherent without proper cleanup. In the case of the ATH10K_DEV_TYPE_HL device type, the beacon_buf is allocated using kmalloc, but there is no corresponding free call. In the case of other device types, the beacon_buf is allocated using dma_alloc_coherent, but the dma_free_coherent call is missing. This can lead to memory leaks if the beacon_buf is not properly cleaned up.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a free call for the kmalloc allocated beacon_buf in the ATH10K_DEV_TYPE_HL case.
2. Add a dma_free_coherent call for the dma_alloc_coherent allocated beacon_buf in the other device types.
