 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. The code uses the `wcn36xx_rate_table` array to determine the rate information, but it does not check if the A-MSDU flag is set before using it. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets by exploiting this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the A-MSDU flag is set before using the `wcn36xx_rate_table` array.
2. Use a secure method to authenticate the A-MSDU flag, such as using a digital signature or a secure hash function.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as WPA3, which includes additional security features to prevent this type of attack.
