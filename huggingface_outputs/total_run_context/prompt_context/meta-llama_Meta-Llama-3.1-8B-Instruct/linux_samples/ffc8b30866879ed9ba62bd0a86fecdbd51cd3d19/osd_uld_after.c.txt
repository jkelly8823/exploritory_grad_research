 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the format string vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2851. The dev_set_name function is being used to set the name of a device, and the format string is being used to insert the disk_name variable into the string. This is a safe use of format strings, as the format string is not being used to extract information from the disk_name variable, but rather to insert it into the string.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to validate user input and ensure that it is not being used in a way that could potentially lead to a vulnerability. In this case, the disk_name variable is being set by the system, so it is unlikely to be a concern. However, if this code were to be used in a different context where the disk_name variable was being set by user input, it would be a good idea to validate that input to ensure it is not being used in a way that could lead to a vulnerability.
