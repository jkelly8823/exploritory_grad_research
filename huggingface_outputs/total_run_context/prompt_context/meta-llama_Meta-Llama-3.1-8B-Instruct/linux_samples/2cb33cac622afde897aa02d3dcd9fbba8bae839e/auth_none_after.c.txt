 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly corresponds to the vulnerability description. The vulnerability is related to a specific kernel module (auth_none.c) and a specific function (build_request) that is not present in the provided code sample. The function handle_reply is present, but it does not match the function name mentioned in the vulnerability description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the kernel module and the build_request function to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the kernel up to date with the latest security patches.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
