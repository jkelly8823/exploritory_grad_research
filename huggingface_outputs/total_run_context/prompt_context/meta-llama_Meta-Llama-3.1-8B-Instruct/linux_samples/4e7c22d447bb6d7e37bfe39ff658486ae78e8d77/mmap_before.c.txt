 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-1593 because it uses incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations. The line `max = ((-1U) & STACK_RND_MASK) << PAGE_SHIFT;` performs a bitwise left-shift operation on the result of a bitwise AND operation, which can lead to incorrect results due to the incorrect data type used. This can make it easier for attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by predicting the address of the top of the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the data type of the `max` variable to a 64-bit integer to prevent overflow and ensure accurate results.
2. Use a more robust method to calculate the maximum stack size, such as using a library function that handles the calculation correctly.
3. Consider using a different method to randomize the stack, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.
