 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-1593 because it uses incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations. The variable random_variable is shifted left by PAGE_SHIFT, which is a 12-bit value, but it is not guaranteed to be a 12-bit value. This can cause the high bits of the result to be lost, making it easier for attackers to predict the address of the top of the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a 64-bit left shift operation to ensure that the high bits of the result are not lost.
2. Use a more robust method to generate the random variable, such as using the get_random_long function instead of get_random_int.
3. Consider using a more secure method to randomize the stack, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-1593
CVE Description:
The stack randomization feature in the Linux kernel before 3.19.1 on 64-bit platforms uses incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass
