 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS) due to the use of the mwait instruction. This instruction can be used to leak information from the store buffer, which is a side-channel attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the microcode to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability.
2. Use a different instruction that does not rely on speculative execution, such as the wbinvd instruction.
3. Disable the mwait instruction by setting the MWAIT_SUBSTATE_MASK and MWAIT_CSTATE_MASK to 0. This will prevent the instruction from being executed.
