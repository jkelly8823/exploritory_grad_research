 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS) and Microarchitectural Fill Buffer Data Sampling (MFBDS) due to the lack of proper mitigation for speculative execution. The `cpu_set_bug_bits` function does not properly handle the `ARCH_CAP_SSB_NO` and `ARCH_CAP_MFBDS_NO` flags, which are used to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This allows an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the `cpu_set_bug_bits` function to properly handle the `ARCH_CAP_SSB_NO` and `ARCH_CAP_MFBDS_NO` flags.
2. Add proper mitigation for speculative execution, such as using the `IBRS` instruction.
3. Ensure that the `cpu_no_spec_store_bypass` and `cpu_no_meltdown` lists are up-to-date and accurate.
