 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) attacks, specifically MDSUM. This is because the code uses the `cpuid` instruction to retrieve information about the CPU, which can be used to leak sensitive information through side-channel attacks. The `cpuid` instruction is known to be vulnerable to MDS attacks, and the code does not take any measures to mitigate this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to retrieve CPU information, such as using the `cpuid_count` instruction with the `cpuid_count` function.
2. Apply the latest microcode updates to the CPU, as recommended by Intel.
3. Consider using a secure CPU feature detection mechanism, such as the `cpuid_count` instruction with the `cpuid_count` function, to avoid using the vulnerable `cpuid` instruction. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-12126
CVE Description:
Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS): Store buffers on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access
