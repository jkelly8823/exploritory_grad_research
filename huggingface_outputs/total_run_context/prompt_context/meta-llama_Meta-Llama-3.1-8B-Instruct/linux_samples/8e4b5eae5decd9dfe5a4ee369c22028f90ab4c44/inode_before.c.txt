VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1092 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle the case of a root directory with a zero i_links_count. The vulnerability is present in the line where the code checks if the inode size is greater than the good old inode size. If the inode size is greater than the good old inode size, the code sets the i_extra_isize field of the ei structure. However, if the i_links_count is zero, the code does not properly handle this case, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference and OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for i_links_count being zero before setting the i_extra_isize field.
2. Properly handle the case of a root directory with a zero i_links_count by setting the i_extra_isize field to a valid value. 
3. Consider adding additional error checking to ensure that the inode size is valid before setting the i_extra_isize field. 4. Consider adding a check to ensure that the i_extra_isize field is not set to a value that is greater than the maximum allowed value. 5. Consider adding
