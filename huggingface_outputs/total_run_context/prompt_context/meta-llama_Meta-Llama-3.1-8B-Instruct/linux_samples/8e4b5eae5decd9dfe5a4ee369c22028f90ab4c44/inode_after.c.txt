 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1092 vulnerability. This is because the code checks if the root directory has a zero i_links_count, but it does not properly handle the case where the root directory has a zero i_links_count and the inode is not allocated. This can cause a denial of service (ext4_process_freed_data NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted ext4 image.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the inode is allocated before checking the i_links_count.
2. Use a more robust method to handle the case where the root directory has a zero i_links_count, such as by checking the inode's allocation status before attempting to access it.
3. Consider adding additional error handling to prevent the NULL pointer dereference and OOPS. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1092
CVE Description:
The ext4_iget function in fs/ext4/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 mishandles the case of a root directory with a zero i_links_count, which allows attackers to cause a
