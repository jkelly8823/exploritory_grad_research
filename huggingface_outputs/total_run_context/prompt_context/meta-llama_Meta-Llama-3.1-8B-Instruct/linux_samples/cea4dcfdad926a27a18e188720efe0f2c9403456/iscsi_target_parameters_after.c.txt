 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the iscsi_add_notunderstood_response function. This is due to the strlcpy function being used to copy the key and value into the extra_response structure. The strlcpy function does not perform bounds checking, and if the key or value is longer than the allocated space in the extra_response structure, it will overflow the buffer and potentially lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strscpy to copy the key and value into the extra_response structure. strscpy will prevent buffer overflows by checking the length of the source string and truncating it if necessary.
2. Increase the size of the key and value fields in the extra_response structure to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Use a memory-safe function like memcpy to copy the key and value into the extra_response structure, and manually check the length of the source string to prevent buffer overflows. 
4. Validate the length of the key and value before copying them into the extra_response structure to prevent buffer overflows.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
