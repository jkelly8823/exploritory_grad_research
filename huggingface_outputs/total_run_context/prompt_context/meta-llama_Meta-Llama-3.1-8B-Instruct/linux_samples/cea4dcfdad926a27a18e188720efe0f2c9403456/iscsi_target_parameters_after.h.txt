 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of proper bounds checking on the key field in the iscsi_extra_response struct. The key field is declared as a character array of size KEY_MAXLEN, but there is no check to ensure that the key does not exceed this length. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the key field to ensure that it does not exceed KEY_MAXLEN.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated string, to store the key field.
3. Ensure that the value field is also properly sanitized to prevent any potential buffer overflows. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2850
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the iscsi_add_notunderstood_response function in drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target_parameters.c in the iSCSI target subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and OOPS) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long key that is not
