 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the iscsi_add_notunderstood_response function. This is due to the use of strncpy with a size that is not sufficient to prevent buffer overflow. The strncpy function does not null-terminate the destination string if the source string is longer than the destination buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the strlcpy function instead of strncpy to prevent buffer overflow. strlcpy will null-terminate the destination string even if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.
2. Increase the size of the extra_response->key and extra_response->value buffers to prevent buffer overflow.
3. Use a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflow. 
4. Validate the input key and NOTUNDERSTOOD strings to prevent buffer overflow.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2850
CVE Description:
Heap-based buffer overflow in the iscsi_add_notunderstood_response function in drivers/target/iscsi/iscsi_target_parameters.c in the iSCSI target subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4
