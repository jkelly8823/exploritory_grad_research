 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3646 because it does not have an exit handler for the INVVPID instruction. This allows a guest OS user to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add an exit handler for the INVVPID instruction in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file.
2. Ensure that all exit handlers are properly implemented and tested to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```
