 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3646 because it does not have an exit handler for the INVVPID instruction. The handle_invvpid function is present but it does not properly handle the exit, it simply queues an exception and returns 1. This can cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) for a crafted application.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a proper exit handler for the INVVPID instruction. This should involve properly handling the exit and returning 1 if the exit was handled fully and guest execution may resume.
2. Review the existing exit handlers to ensure they are properly handling their respective exits. This will help prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 
3. Consider adding additional checks to ensure that the INVVPID instruction is properly handled before it is executed. This can help prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. 4. Update the kvm_vmx_max_exit_handlers constant to reflect the correct number of exit handlers. 5. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling the INVVPID instruction in all cases. 6. Consider adding additional logging or debugging statements to help diagnose any issues related to the INV
