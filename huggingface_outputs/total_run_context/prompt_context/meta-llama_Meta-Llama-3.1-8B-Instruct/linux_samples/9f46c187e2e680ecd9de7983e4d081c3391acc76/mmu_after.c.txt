 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference when INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0. This is because the invlpg callback is not set in this case, and the result is a NULL pointer dereference when calling kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the invlpg callback is set before calling it.
2. Set the invlpg callback when INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0.
3. Use a safe pointer check before calling kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva to prevent NULL pointer dereference. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-1789
CVE Description:
