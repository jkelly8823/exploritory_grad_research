 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-4461 because it checks if the guest CPU has XSAVE support and if the OSXSAVE bit is set in the guest cr4 register. However, it does not check if the host CPU has XSAVE support. If the host CPU does not have XSAVE support, the code will still set the IDT and GDT using the kvm_x86_ops->set_idt function, which can cause a kernel OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the host CPU has XSAVE support before setting the IDT and GDT.
2. Use a more robust method to handle the XSAVE feature, such as using the kvm_x86_ops->get_xsave_support function to check if the host CPU has XSAVE support. 
3. Consider using a fallback mechanism to handle the case where the host CPU does not have XSAVE support. 
4. Review the kvm_x86_ops->set_idt function to ensure it is properly handling the XSAVE feature.  ```c
int pending_vec, max_bits, idx;
struct desc_ptr dt;
