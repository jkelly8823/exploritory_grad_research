 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write due to the use of kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL. This can be exploited by a physically proximate attacker to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a safer memory allocation function such as kmalloc_node or kcalloc to prevent heap-based out-of-bounds writes. Additionally, consider using a more secure memory allocation function such as slab_alloc to prevent kernel memory corruption. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2891
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-steelseries.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_STEELSERIES is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based out-of-bounds write) via a crafted device. 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2890
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-sony.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_SONY is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers
