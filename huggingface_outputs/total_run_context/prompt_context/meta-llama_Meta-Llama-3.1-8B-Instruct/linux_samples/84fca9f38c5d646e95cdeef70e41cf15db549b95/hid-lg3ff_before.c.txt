 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write due to the use of memset with a potentially large maxusage value. This can lead to a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that maxusage is always set to 63 to prevent potential issues.
2. Consider using a safer function like memset_s or __builtin_memset to prevent potential buffer overflows.
3. Validate the maxusage value before using it to prevent potential out-of-bounds writes. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2895 vulnerability, as it does not involve a NULL pointer dereference or OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-2897 vulnerability, as it does not involve a heap memory corruption or NULL pointer dereference and OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
