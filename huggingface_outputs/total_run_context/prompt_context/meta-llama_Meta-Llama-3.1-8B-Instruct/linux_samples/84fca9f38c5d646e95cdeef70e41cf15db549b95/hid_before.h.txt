 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to multiple array index errors due to the lack of bounds checking in the hid_parse_report function. This function does not check if the size of the report is within the valid range, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption, or NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted device.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add bounds checking to the hid_parse_report function to ensure that the size of the report is within the valid range.
- Use a secure allocation function to allocate memory for the report, such as kmalloc or kzalloc.
- Consider using a safer data structure, such as a linked list, to store reports instead of a fixed-size array. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2897
CVE Description:
Multiple array index errors in drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_MULTITOUCH is enabled, allow physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption, or NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted
