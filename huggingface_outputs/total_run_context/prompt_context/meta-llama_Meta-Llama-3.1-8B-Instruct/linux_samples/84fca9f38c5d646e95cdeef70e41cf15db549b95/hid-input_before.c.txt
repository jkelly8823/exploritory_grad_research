 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write due to the lack of bounds checking in the list_for_each_entry and for loops. This can be exploited by a physically proximate attacker to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the list_for_each_entry and for loops to prevent out-of-bounds access.
2. Use a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the report fields and usages.
3. Validate the input data to prevent unexpected behavior.
