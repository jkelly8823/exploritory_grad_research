 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the possibility of left_info and right_info being the same. This is because the code does not check if the left_info and right_info are the same before using them. If the left_info and right_info are the same, it will lead to a use-after-free bug when the code tries to access the left_info and right_info after they have been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that left_info and right_info are not the same before using them.
2. Consider using a different data structure that does not have this issue. 
3. Use a lock to protect the access to left_info and right_info to prevent concurrent access and use-after-free bug.
