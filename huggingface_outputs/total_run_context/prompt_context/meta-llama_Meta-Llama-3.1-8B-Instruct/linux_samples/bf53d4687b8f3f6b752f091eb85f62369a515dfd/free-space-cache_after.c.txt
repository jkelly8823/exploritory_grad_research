VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free error due to the possibility of left_info being set to the same pointer as right_info. This occurs when right_info is not NULL and rb_prev(&right_info->offset_index) returns a valid entry. In this case, left_info is set to the same pointer as right_info, and later, when the code tries to access left_info, it may have already been freed, leading to a use-after-free error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if left_info is NULL before accessing it to prevent the use-after-free error.
2. Use a different approach to find the left_info, such as using a separate data structure or function to avoid the possibility of left_info being set to the same pointer as right_info. 
3. Consider using a lock to protect the access to left_info to prevent concurrent modifications. 
4. Review the code to ensure that left_info is not accessed after it has been freed.  ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *p = 10;
    free
