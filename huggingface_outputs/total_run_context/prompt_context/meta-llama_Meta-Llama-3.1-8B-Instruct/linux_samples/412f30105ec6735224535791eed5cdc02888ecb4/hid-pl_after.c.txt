 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code does not contain any heap-based out-of-bounds write operations. The code is checking for specific conditions and assigning values to variables based on those conditions. The conditions do not involve any operations that could lead to a heap-based out-of-bounds write.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and to follow secure coding practices.  The code could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of each section and by following a consistent naming convention.  Additionally, the code could be improved by adding error checking to handle any potential errors that may occur.  However, these are not related to the specific CVE being checked for.
