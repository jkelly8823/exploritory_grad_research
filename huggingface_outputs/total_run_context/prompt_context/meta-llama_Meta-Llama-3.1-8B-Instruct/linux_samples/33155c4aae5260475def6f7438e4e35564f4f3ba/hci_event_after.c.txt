 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for a NULL link key against CVE-2020-26555 by comparing it to a predefined ZERO_KEY. If a match is found, it ignores the link key and disconnects the connection. This is a valid mitigation against the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code already implements a valid fix for the vulnerability. However, it would be beneficial to consider using a more secure pairing method, such as Secure Connections (SC) or LE Secure Connections (LE SC), to further mitigate the risk.  The code could also be improved by adding more logging or error handling to provide better visibility into the connection process.  Additionally, the use of a constant like ZERO_KEY could be avoided by using a more secure method to check for a NULL link key.  The code could also be improved by adding more logging or error handling to provide better visibility into the connection process.
