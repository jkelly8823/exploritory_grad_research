 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-3344 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the shutdown of a cooperative nested guest (L2). The svm_vcpu_free_msrpm function is called before freeing the vmcb02 page, which can lead to a page fault and kernel panic in the host (L0) if the L1 guest fails to intercept the shutdown.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call svm_vcpu_free_msrpm after freeing the vmcb02 page to ensure proper shutdown of the nested guest.
2. Add a check to ensure that the L1 guest has intercepted the shutdown before freeing the vmcb02 page. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3156
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization) feature was implemented. This flaw allowed an attacker to bypass KASLR by manipulating the crash kernel image location.

Code Sample:
	#define CRASH_KERNEL_IMAGE_BASE 0x10000000
	#define CRASH_KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE 0x1000000

	void crash_kernel_init(void)
