 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Netlink spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2012-3520) because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The vulnerability is present in the scm_send function, specifically in the line where unix_get_peersec_dgram is called. This function is used to get the peer's security credentials, but it does not check if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This allows an attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message without SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data before calling unix_get_peersec_dgram.
2. Consider using a more secure method to get the peer's security credentials, such as using a secure protocol or verifying the credentials before using them. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a
