 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read due to the use of the variable if_num as an index for the array config_data. The variable if_num is a u8 and can potentially be larger than the size of the array, leading to an OOB read. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the type of if_num to match the size of the array config_data. This will prevent the possibility of an OOB read.
2. Add a bounds check to ensure that if_num is within the valid range of the array config_data before using it as an index.
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a struct or a vector, to store the data in config_data. This will make it more difficult for an attacker to manipulate the data and cause an OOB read.
