 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read due to the use of the variable if_num as an index for the array config_data. The variable if_num is read from the USB device as a u8, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer, and is used to index an array of size 256. This can result in an OOB read if the value of if_num is greater than or equal to 256.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the type of if_num to a 32-bit integer to prevent the OOB read.
2. Add bounds checking to ensure that if_num is within the valid range of the array config_data.
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced binary search tree, to store the data in the config_data array. This would eliminate the need for indexing and prevent the OOB read.
