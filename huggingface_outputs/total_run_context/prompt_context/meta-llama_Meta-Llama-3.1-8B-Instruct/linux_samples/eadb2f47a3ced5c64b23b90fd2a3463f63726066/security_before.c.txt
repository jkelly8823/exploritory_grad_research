 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a list of lockdown modes, which are used to restrict access to certain kernel features. However, the lockdown modes themselves do not contain any code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. The vulnerability described in the CVE is related to the KGDB and KDB debuggers, which are not present in this code sample. Therefore, the code sample is not vulnerable to the described CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to ensure that the lockdown modes are properly configured and enforced to prevent potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the system. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-21499
CVE Description:
KGDB and KDB allow read and write access to kernel memory, and thus should be restricted during lockdown. An attacker with access to a serial port could trigger the debugger so it is important that the debugger respect the lockdown mode when/if it is triggered.
