 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-21499 because it allows read and write access to kernel memory when the debugger is triggered, even if lockdown is applied. This is due to the fact that the debugger does not respect the lockdown mode when triggered, allowing an attacker with access to a serial port to potentially exploit this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Restrict access to kernel memory when the debugger is triggered, even if lockdown is applied.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, such as validating user input and ensuring that the debugger only has access to authorized memory regions.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to kgdb, such as a debugger that respects lockdown mode and does not allow read and write access to kernel memory. 
4. Update the code to handle the case where lockdown is applied before the debug core gets started, to prevent potential issues with kgdb being used to poke at kernel memory. 
5. Print a lockdown message on the console to inform developers of the potential risks associated with using kgdb in lockdown mode.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
