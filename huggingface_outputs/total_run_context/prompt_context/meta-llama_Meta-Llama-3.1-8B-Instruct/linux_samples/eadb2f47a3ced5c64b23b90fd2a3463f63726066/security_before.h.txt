 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a list of lockdown flags, which are used to restrict access to certain kernel features. However, the lockdown flags themselves do not contain any vulnerabilities. The vulnerability described in CVE-2022-21499 is related to the KGDB and KDB debuggers not respecting the lockdown mode, which is not directly related to the lockdown flags. Therefore, the code sample provided does not contain the vulnerability described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided is not vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to ensure that the KGDB and KDB debuggers are properly configured to respect the lockdown mode to prevent potential security issues.
