 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code allocates memory using GFP_NOIO | __GFP_ZERO and GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO, which should zero out the memory before allocating it. Additionally, the code does not share memory regions without zeroing them, which is a requirement to prevent data leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the described CVEs. However, it's always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it meets the security requirements of the project. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-26365
CVE Description:
Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K
