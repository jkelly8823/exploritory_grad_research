 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-26365 vulnerability. The code allocates memory for the granted_page and indirect_pages without properly clearing it. This can lead to data leaks when the memory is shared with the backend. The BUG_ON statement is not relevant to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use kzalloc instead of alloc_page to clear the memory before allocation.
2. Use kfree_page instead of kfree to free the page. 
3. Consider using a more granular grant table to avoid sharing unrelated data. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-33740
CVE Description:
Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend.

Code Sample:
			goto out_of_memory;

		if (info->feature_persistent) {
			granted_page = alloc_page(GFP_NOIO);
			if (!granted_page) {
				kfree(gnt_list_entry);
				goto out_of_memory;
			}

		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&rinfo->indirect_pages));
		for (i = 0; i <
