 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a function definition for the standard library function memcpy(). The function is implemented with a conditional compilation directive that checks for the presence of the CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW configuration option. If the option is present, the function calls __memcpy3d(), otherwise it calls __memcpy(). The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2016-3858) as it does not involve a buffer overflow in the Qualcomm subsystem driver. The vulnerability is specific to the Qualcomm subsystem driver and is not related to the standard library function memcpy().
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the conditional compilation directive is correctly implemented. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the __memcpy3d() and __memcpy() functions are correctly implemented and do not contain any vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-3858
CVE Description:
Buffer overflow in drivers/soc/qcom/subsystem_restart.c in the Qualcomm subsystem driver in Android before 2016
