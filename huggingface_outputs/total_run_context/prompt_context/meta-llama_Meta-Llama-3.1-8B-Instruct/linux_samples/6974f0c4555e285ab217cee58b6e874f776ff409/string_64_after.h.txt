 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function is used to copy data from one location to another, but it does not check if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the __memcpy function with bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use the memcpy_mcsafe_unrolled function which is designed to be safe for multi-threaded environments.
3. Implement bounds checking for the memcpy function to prevent buffer overflow. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-3858
CVE Description:
Buffer overflow in drivers/soc/qcom/subsystem_restart.c in the Qualcomm subsystem driver in Android before 2016-09-05 on Nexus 5X and 6P devices allows attackers to gain privileges via a crafted application that provides a long string, aka Android internal bug 28675151 and Qualcomm internal bug CR1022641.  This vulnerability is related to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking
