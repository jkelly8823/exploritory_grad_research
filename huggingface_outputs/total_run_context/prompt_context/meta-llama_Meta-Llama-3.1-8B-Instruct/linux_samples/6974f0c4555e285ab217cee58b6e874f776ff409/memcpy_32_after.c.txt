 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a custom implementation of the memcpy function. However, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE-2016-3858. The code checks for the presence of CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, and if they are not present, it calls the standard __memcpy function. This suggests that the code is designed to use the standard memcpy function when the custom __memcpy3d function is not available. The custom function is not present in the provided code sample, so it is not possible to determine if it is vulnerable to the described CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure. However, it is recommended to review the custom __memcpy3d function if it is present in the codebase to ensure that it is not vulnerable to the described CVE. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW and CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE configuration options are properly set to prevent the use of the custom __memcpy3d function when it is not available.
