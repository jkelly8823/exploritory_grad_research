 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the buffer overflow vulnerability described in CVE-2016-3858. The vulnerability is specific to the Qualcomm subsystem driver in Android, and the code sample appears to be a generic implementation of various memory functions. The code does not contain any references to the Qualcomm subsystem driver or any code that would be susceptible to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure and free of vulnerabilities. Additionally, the code sample could benefit from more descriptive variable names and comments to improve readability and maintainability.  The use of __builtin_memset and __builtin_memcmp functions may also be a concern if the compiler being used does not support these functions or if the code is being compiled with a different compiler.  It may be beneficial to use standard library functions instead.  The code also uses a macro to define the memset function, which may lead to issues if the macro is not properly defined or if the code is being compiled with a different set of compiler
