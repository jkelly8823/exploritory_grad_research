 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a header file that defines constants for VirtIO device IDs. It does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a double-free memory corruption vulnerability like the one described in CVE-2021-3564. The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem, which is not present in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to follow secure coding practices.
