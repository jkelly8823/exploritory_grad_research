VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2021-3564 double-free memory corruption flaw. The code snippet appears to be a part of a Bluetooth HCI device initialization subsystem and is focused on cleanup and flushing of work queues and skb queues in case of initialization failure. There is no indication of any double-free operations being performed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not require any modifications to address the CVE-2021-3564 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security.
