 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a double-free memory corruption issue. This is because the firmware_request_nowarn function is called twice with the same fwname argument, which can lead to a double-free error when the firmware is unloaded. This is a serious issue that can cause the system to crash or become unstable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate call to firmware_request_nowarn and ensure that the firmware is only requested once.
2. Use a unique fwname argument for each call to firmware_request_nowarn to avoid any potential double-free issues.
3. Consider using a more robust firmware loading mechanism that can handle errors and exceptions more effectively.
