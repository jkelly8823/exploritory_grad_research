 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The check for the pool being in use is done after the check for the pool being allocated. This allows a potential attacker to create a race condition where the pool is deallocated before the check for it being in use is performed. This can lead to a deadlock and denial of service condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Swap the order of the checks to ensure that the pool is checked for being in use before it is deallocated.
2. Use a lock to protect the critical section of code to prevent race conditions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000004
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel 4.12, 3.10, 2.6 and possibly earlier versions a race condition vulnerability exists in the sound system, this can lead to a deadlock and denial of service condition.  This vulnerability is present in the code sample.  The code sample is vulnerable to the same type of race condition described in the CVE.  The code sample checks if the pool is allocated before checking if it is in use, which allows a potential attacker to create
