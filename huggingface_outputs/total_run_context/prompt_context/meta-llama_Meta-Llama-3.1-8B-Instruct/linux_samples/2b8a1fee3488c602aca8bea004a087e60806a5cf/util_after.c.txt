 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to A-MSDU aggregation injection attacks. The check for `ether_addr_equal(eth.h_dest, rfc1042_header)` is incomplete as it only checks for a specific destination MAC address. It does not account for other possible destination MAC addresses that could be used for injection attacks. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the check to account for all possible destination MAC addresses that could be used for injection attacks.
2. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent A-MSDU aggregation injection attacks, such as validating the source MAC address or implementing a more robust authentication mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary
