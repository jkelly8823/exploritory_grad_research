 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-13080 because it allows the GTK to be reinstated during the group key handshake. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly check for the GTK before replacing the key. The lines 9-11 are vulnerable because they do not check if the GTK is pairwise before replacing the key.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the GTK is not pairwise before replacing the key.
2. Use a more secure method to replace the key, such as using a secure key derivation function.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as WPA3, which is not vulnerable to this attack.  ```c
