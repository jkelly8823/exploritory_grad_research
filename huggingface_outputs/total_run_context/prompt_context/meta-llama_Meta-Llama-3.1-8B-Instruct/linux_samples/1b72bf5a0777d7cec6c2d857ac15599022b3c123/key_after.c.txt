 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-13080 because it silently accepts key re-installation without really installing the new version of the key. This can lead to nonce reuse or replay issues. The vulnerability is present in lines 15-17 where the code checks if the old key and the new key have the same length and are equal. If they are, it silently accepts the key re-installation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the silent key re-installation logic and instead properly install the new key version.
2. Update the code to properly handle key re-installation and prevent nonce reuse or replay issues.
3. Consider using a secure key management mechanism to prevent such vulnerabilities.
