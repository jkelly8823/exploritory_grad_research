 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 11, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5123 due to insufficient data validation in the waitid function. The function does not properly validate the input data, allowing an attacker to potentially escape sandboxes on Linux. The lines 7, 11, and 15 are vulnerable because they use the unsafe_put_user function to write user data to the kernel without proper validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input data before writing it to the kernel.
2. Use the put_user function instead of unsafe_put_user to ensure proper validation.
3. Remove the redundant checks for!infop. 
4. Consider using a safer function to write user data to the kernel, such as copy_from_user. 5. Review the code to ensure that all user data is properly validated before writing it to the kernel. 6. Consider using a kernel module to handle the waitid function and validate the input data. 7. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that all kernel functions are properly validated. 8. Review the code to ensure that it follows the secure coding guidelines. 9. Consider using a code review tool
