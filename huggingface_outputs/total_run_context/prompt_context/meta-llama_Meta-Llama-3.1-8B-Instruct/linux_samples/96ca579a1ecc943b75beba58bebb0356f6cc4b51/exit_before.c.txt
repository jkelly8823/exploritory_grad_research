 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5123 vulnerability. The issue lies in the fact that the code does not properly validate the input data before passing it to the unsafe_put_user function. This allows an attacker to potentially escape sandboxes on Linux.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input data before passing it to the unsafe_put_user function.
2. Use the safe_put_user function instead of unsafe_put_user to ensure proper validation.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to the unsafe_put_user function, such as the memcpy function. 
4. Ensure that the user_access_begin and user_access_end functions are properly used to prevent data corruption. 
5. Consider using a code review tool to catch similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```bash
