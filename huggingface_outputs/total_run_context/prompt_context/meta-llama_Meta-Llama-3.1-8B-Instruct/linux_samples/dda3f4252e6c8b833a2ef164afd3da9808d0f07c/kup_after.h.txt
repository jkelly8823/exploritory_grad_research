 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. The code is related to the PowerPC architecture and deals with cache management and user access control. The specified CVEs (CVE-2020-4788) are related to the IBM Power9 processor's L1 cache, which is not directly related to the code provided. The code seems to be implementing a cache management system for the PowerPC architecture, but it does not contain any code that would allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the L1 cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that it is properly implementing the cache management and user access control mechanisms for the PowerPC architecture. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates for the PowerPC architecture.  The code may be vulnerable to other types of vulnerabilities, and a thorough review of the code is recommended.  It is also recommended to use a static analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  The code may also benefit from additional testing and
