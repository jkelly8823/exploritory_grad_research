 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 951/None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability. This is because the code includes a section of code that is not properly aligned, which could potentially allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. The specific line of code that is vulnerable is line 951, where the.pushsection directive is used to define a new section of code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly align the section of code that is being defined. This can be done by adding the.align directive before the.pushsection directive, like so:.align 2;.pushsection __rfi_flush_fixup,"a";. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all sections of code are properly aligned and that there are no other potential vulnerabilities present.
