 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 959-960, 957-958, 951
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability due to the use of the.pushsection and.popsection directives. These directives are used to create and destroy sections in the code, which can potentially allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the.pushsection and.popsection directives in sensitive code sections.
2. Use alternative methods to create and destroy sections, such as using the __attribute__((section("section_name"))) directive.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a compiler flag to disable the use of the L1 cache.
