 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a cache side-channel attack due to the use of the `load` function, which loads data from a specific memory address without any synchronization or cache coherence mechanisms. This allows an attacker to potentially leak sensitive information from the L1 cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a cache-friendly function to load data, such as `memcpy` or `loadu` with proper synchronization and cache coherence mechanisms.
2. Implement cache-side-channel mitigation techniques, such as cache partitioning or cache randomization.
3. Consider using a secure programming model, such as Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) or ARM's TrustZone, to protect sensitive data from cache-based attacks.
