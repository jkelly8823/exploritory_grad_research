 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability because it allows a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. This is due to the fact that the RFI flush is not properly disabled when the "no_rfi_flush" option is set.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly disable the RFI flush when the "no_rfi_flush" option is set by adding a check for the "no_rfi_flush" option in the init_fallback_flush function.
2. Remove the hijacking of the "nopti" option to disable the RFI flush, as this is not a reliable or secure way to disable the RFI flush.
3. Consider using a more secure method to disable the RFI flush, such as using a separate option or configuration file.
