 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the IBM Power9 processor or any related functions that could potentially lead to the L1 cache data exposure vulnerability. The includes are general Linux kernel headers and do not indicate any specific vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be a generic Linux kernel header file and does not contain any code that could be exploited by the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability. However, it is essential to note that this code sample is a header file and does not contain any executable code. Therefore, it is not possible to exploit this vulnerability through this code alone. Further analysis of the code that includes this header file is required to determine if the vulnerability is present.  ```bash
