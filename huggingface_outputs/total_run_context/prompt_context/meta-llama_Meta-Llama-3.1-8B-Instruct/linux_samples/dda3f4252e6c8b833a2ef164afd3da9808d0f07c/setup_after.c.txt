 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability because it uses the `security_ftr_enabled` function to check if certain security features are enabled, but it does not properly handle the case where these features are not enabled. This can lead to sensitive information being leaked from the L1 cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the `security_ftr_enabled` function returns an error code before using its result.
2. Use a default value or a fallback mechanism to handle the case where the security features are not enabled.
3. Consider using a more robust way to handle the security features, such as using a separate configuration file or a more secure way to store the feature settings.
