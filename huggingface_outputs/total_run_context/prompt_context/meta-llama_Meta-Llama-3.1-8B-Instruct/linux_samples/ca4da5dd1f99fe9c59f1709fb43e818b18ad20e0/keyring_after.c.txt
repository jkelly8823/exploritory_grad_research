 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the memory leak in the __key_link_end function in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.4. The vulnerability is present in the line where the up_write function is called without a corresponding down_write function. This can cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via many add_key system calls that refer to existing keys.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the down_write function is called before the up_write function to prevent the memory leak.
2. Consider using a lock to prevent concurrent access to the keyring_serialise_link_sem and keyring->sem.
