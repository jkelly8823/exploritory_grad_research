 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. The variable ima_rules_tmp is assigned the value of rcu_dereference(ima_rules) without checking if ima_rules is null. If ima_rules is null, then rcu_dereference(ima_rules) will return null, and assigning this value to ima_rules_tmp will result in a null pointer dereference when trying to access ima_rules_tmp.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if ima_rules is null before assigning the value of rcu_dereference(ima_rules) to ima_rules_tmp.
2. Use a null check to ensure that ima_rules is not null before trying to access it.
