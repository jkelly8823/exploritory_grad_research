 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow. The variable 'id' is compared against 'READING_MAX_ID' without any checks for its data type. If 'id' is a large integer, it may cause an integer overflow when compared against 'READING_MAX_ID', leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safe comparison method, such as using a library function that checks for integer overflow, or by using a type-safe comparison method.
2. Ensure that 'id' and 'READING_MAX_ID' are of the same data type to prevent potential type mismatches.
3. Consider using a more robust data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to prevent integer overflow issues.
