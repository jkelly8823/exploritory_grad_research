 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588 because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. The vulnerability is present in lines 14-15 where the code sets the CSR_GP_CNTRL_REG_FLAG_BUS_MASTER_DISABLE_REQ and CSR_GP_CNTRL_REG_FLAG_BUS_MASTER_DISABLE_STATUS flags without proper authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Use a secure method to disable the bus master, such as using a secure firmware update.
3. Implement a secure handshake mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the device. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (
