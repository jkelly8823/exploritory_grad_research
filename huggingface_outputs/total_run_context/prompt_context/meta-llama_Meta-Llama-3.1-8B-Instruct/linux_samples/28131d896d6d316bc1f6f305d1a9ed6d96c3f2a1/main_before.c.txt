 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. The code uses the GENMASK macro to set the legacy and ht_mcs fields of the bitrate_mask.control structure, but it does not check if the A-MSDU flag is set before doing so. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets by exploiting this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the A-MSDU flag is not set before setting the legacy and ht_mcs fields.
2. Use a secure method to authenticate the A-MSDU flag, such as using a cryptographic hash function.
3. Consider using a more secure method to set the bitrate_mask.control structure, such as using a secure API or a secure data structure.
