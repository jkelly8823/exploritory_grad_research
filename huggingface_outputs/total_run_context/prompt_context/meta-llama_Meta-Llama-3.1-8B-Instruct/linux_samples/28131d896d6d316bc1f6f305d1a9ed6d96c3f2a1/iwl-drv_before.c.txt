 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588 because it does not authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. The vulnerability is present in the iwl_parse_tlv_firmware function, specifically in the switch statement where the code does not check the authenticity of the A-MSDU flag.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the A-MSDU flag is authenticated before processing the TLV.
2. Update the code to use a secure method for authenticating the A-MSDU flag, such as using a digital signature or a secure hash function.
3. Consider using a secure protocol for transmitting firmware updates, such as HTTPS or SFTP, to prevent tampering with the firmware.
