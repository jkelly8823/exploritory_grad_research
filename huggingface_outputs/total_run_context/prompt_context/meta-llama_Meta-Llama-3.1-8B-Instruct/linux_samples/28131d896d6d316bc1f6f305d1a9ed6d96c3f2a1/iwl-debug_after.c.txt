 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the va_copy function without checking the size of the buffer. The va_copy function is used to create a copy of the va_list, but it does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the copy. If the buffer is not large enough, it can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the va_start and va_end functions to initialize and clean up the va_list, respectively.
2. Use the vsnprintf function to safely print the formatted string.
3. Check the size of the buffer before copying the va_list to it.
