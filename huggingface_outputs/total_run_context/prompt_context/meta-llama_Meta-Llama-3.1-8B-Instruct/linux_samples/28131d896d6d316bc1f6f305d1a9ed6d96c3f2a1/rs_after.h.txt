 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the A-MSDU flag is properly authenticated in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Implement a mechanism to validate the integrity of the QoS header field.
3. Consider using a secure protocol to encrypt the QoS header field. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it complies with the latest security standards. 
5. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory
