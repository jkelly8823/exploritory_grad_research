 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the A-MSDU flag is properly authenticated before processing the QoS header field.
2. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent arbitrary network packet injection.
3. Review the code to ensure that it complies with the 802.11 standard and does not introduce any other vulnerabilities.  ```python
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.

Code Sample:
