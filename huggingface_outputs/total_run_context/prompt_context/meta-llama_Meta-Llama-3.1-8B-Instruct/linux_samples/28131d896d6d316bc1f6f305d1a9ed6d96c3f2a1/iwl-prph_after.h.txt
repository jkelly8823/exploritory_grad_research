 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that all devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames are properly configured to prevent this vulnerability.
3. Regularly update and patch the 802.11 standard to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.
