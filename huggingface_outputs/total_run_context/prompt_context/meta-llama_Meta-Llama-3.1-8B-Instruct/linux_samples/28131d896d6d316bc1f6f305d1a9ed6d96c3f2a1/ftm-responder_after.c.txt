 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `fallthrough` statement in the switch-case block. The `fallthrough` statement allows the code to continue executing the next case statement without properly checking the conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `fallthrough` statement and ensure that each case statement has a proper return or break statement.
2. Add a check to ensure that the `cmd_ver` variable is within the expected range before calling the `iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2` function.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a switch-case statement with a default case to handle unexpected values.
