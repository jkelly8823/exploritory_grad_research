 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code related to Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) or Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). It appears to be a header file that includes code from other projects, but it does not implement any functionality that would be vulnerable to the described CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is recommended to review the included code from other projects to ensure that it is up-to-date and secure. Additionally, consider using a secure coding practice to ensure that any new code added to this project is secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this
