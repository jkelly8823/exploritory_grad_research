 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588 because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that all devices supporting 802.11n receive non-SSP A-MSDU frames are properly configured to handle this scenario.
3. Regularly update and patch the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocols to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.  ```bash
