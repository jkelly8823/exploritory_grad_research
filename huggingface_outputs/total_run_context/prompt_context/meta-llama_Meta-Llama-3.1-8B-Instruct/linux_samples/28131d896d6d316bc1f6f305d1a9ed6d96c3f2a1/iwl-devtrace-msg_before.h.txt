 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not check for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field, which is required to prevent an adversary from injecting arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field to ensure that only authenticated frames are processed.
2. Implement a mechanism to authenticate the A-MSDU flag, such as using a digital signature or a hash function.
3. Update the code to comply with the 802.11 standard, which requires authentication of the A-MSDU flag. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802
