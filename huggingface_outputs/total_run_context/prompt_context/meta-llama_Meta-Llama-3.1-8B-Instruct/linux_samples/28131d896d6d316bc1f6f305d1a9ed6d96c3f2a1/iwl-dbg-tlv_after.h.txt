VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3156
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the emulation of the x86 "sgdt" and "sidt" instructions. This occurred when a guest attempted to read or write to a GDTR or IDTR that was not properly aligned. This flaw allowed a guest to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges.

Code Sample:
