 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the 802.11 standard or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). The code includes headers from the Linux kernel related to Ethernet and MAC80211, but it does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and audit code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with sensitive or critical systems. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network
