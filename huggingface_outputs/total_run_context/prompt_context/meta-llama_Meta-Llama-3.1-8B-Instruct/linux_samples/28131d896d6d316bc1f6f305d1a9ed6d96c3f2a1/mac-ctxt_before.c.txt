 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 15, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588 due to the lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that the station is authorized before allowing multicast data frames.
3. Validate the rate and flags before setting them in the tx command. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.  ```python
