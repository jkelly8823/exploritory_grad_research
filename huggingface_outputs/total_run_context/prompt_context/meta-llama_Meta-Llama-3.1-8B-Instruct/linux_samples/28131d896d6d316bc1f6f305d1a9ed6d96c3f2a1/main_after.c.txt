 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588. The vulnerability is present in the mt7915_set_bitrate_mask function. The function does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  The mt7915_set_bitrate_mask function should be modified to properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2.  The function should be updated to check for the presence of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field and reject any packets that do not meet the authentication requirements.
3.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that all functions that handle network packets are properly authenticated to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
