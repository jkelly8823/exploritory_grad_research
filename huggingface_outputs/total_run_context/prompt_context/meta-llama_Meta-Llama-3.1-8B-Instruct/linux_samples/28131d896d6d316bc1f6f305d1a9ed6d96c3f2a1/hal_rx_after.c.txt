 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is checking the type of the release descriptor and the return buffer manager, which are not related to the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. The vulnerability is related to the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi Protected Access, which is not relevant to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
