 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. The specific lines of code that are vulnerable are 14-16, where the `cpu_to_le16` function is used to set the IEEE80211_VHT_EXT_NSS_BW_CAPABLE flag without proper authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field by using a secure authentication mechanism.
2. Update the code to use a secure method to set the IEEE80211_VHT_EXT_NSS_BW_CAPABLE flag, such as using a secure function like `iwl_crypto_authenticate`.
3. Consider using a secure protocol, such as WPA3, which includes authentication mechanisms for the A-MSDU flag.
