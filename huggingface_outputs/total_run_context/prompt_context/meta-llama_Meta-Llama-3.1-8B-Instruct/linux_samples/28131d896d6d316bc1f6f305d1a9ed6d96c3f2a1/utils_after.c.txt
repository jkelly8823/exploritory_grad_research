 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588 because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that the code properly checks for the presence of the A-MSDU flag before processing the QoS header field.
3. Consider using a secure protocol for transmitting QoS information to prevent tampering. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure against known vulnerabilities. 
5. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames
