 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This vulnerability is related to the 802.11 standard and can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Use a secure method to handle the `buf` parameter in the `wcn36xx_smd_switch_channel_rsp` function to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
3. Validate the length of the `buf` parameter to ensure it does not exceed the expected length.
4. Consider using a secure coding practice such as bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP
