 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that the TX chain is clean before entering the BMPS state.
3. Consider using a secure method to handle the bmps_fail_ct counter to prevent potential attacks. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it complies with the 802.11 standard and does not introduce any other vulnerabilities.  ```
