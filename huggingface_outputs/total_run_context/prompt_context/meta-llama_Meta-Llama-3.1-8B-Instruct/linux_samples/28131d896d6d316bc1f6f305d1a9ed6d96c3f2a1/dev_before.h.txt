 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field, which is a requirement for secure Wi-Fi communication. The code is missing the necessary authentication mechanism to prevent an adversary from injecting arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that the code is updated to support SSP (Secure Simple Pairing) for A-MSDU frames.
3. Review the code to ensure that it complies with the 802.11 standard and the requirements for secure Wi-Fi communication. 
4. Consider using a secure coding framework or library to ensure that the code is secure and compliant with industry standards.  */VULNERABILITY LIST:
