 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that could be used to inject arbitrary network packets. The code is related to wireless network management and does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.

Code Sample:
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		if (i == 5) {
			// code that could potentially be vulnerable
			char buffer[10];
			strcpy(buffer, "Hello, World!");
		}
	}
}
