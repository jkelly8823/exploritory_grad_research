VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking in the mt7915_mcu_add_tlv function. The function does not check if the length of the tlv is within the bounds of the skb, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the length is larger than the available space in the skb.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should be modified to include bounds checking in the mt7915_mcu_add_tlv function to prevent buffer overflows. This can be done by checking if the length of the tlv is less than or equal to the available space in the skb before adding it to the skb. If the length is larger than the available space, an error should be returned to prevent the buffer overflow.
