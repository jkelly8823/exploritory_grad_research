 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the 802.11 standard which does not require authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a more secure version of the 802.11 standard that requires authentication of the A-MSDU flag.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent arbitrary network packet injection.
3. Consider using a secure protocol such as WPA3 to encrypt network traffic. 
4. Regularly update the code to ensure it is using the latest security patches and features. 
5. Consider using a secure coding practice such as secure coding guidelines to ensure the code is secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS
