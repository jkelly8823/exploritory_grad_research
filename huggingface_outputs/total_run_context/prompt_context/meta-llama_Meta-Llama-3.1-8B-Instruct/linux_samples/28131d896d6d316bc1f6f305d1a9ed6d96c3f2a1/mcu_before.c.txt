 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the mt76_tx_queue_skb_raw function is called without authentication of the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field before calling mt76_tx_queue_skb_raw.
2.  Implement a mechanism to prevent non-SSP A-MSDU frames from being received by devices that do not support them.
3.  Update the code to comply with the 802.11 standard that requires authentication of the A-MSDU flag. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part
