 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588 because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Ensure that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is properly authenticated.
2.  Implement a mechanism to verify the authenticity of the QoS header field.
3.  Update the code to comply with the 802.11 standard, which requires authentication of the A-MSDU flag. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.
