 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. Specifically, lines 14-15 of the code do not check if the A-MSDU flag is authenticated before processing the frame. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the A-MSDU flag is authenticated before processing the frame. For example, the code could be modified to check if the A-MSDU flag is set in the QoS header field and if it is authenticated before proceeding. This would prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary network packets.
