 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-24588. This vulnerability is related to the 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). The code does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field, which can be exploited by an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  The code should be modified to properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2.  The code should be updated to use the latest version of the 802.11 standard that includes the necessary authentication mechanisms.
3.  The code should be reviewed and tested to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other similar attacks.
