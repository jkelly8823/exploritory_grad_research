 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field, allowing an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets. The vulnerability is present in the function mt76_set_irq_mask, which is called in the provided code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent arbitrary network packet injection.
3. Review and update the code to ensure it complies with the 802.11 standard. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-24588
CVE Description:
The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can
