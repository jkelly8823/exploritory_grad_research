 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The line `bt_cb(skb)->pkt_type = *((unsigned char *) skb->data);` is accessing the data of the skb without checking its length, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than expected. Additionally, the line `skb_pull(skb, 1);` is removing the first byte of the skb, but it does not check if the skb has at least one byte before doing so, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the skb has at least one byte before accessing its data.
2. Use `skb_header_pointer` to safely access the data of the skb.
3. Consider using a safer way to remove the first byte of the skb, such as using `skb_pull` with a length of 0.
