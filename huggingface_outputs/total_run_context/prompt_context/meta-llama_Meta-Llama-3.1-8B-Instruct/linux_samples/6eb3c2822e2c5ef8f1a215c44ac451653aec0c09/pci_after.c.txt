VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000112
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by reading the contents of /proc/kallsyms.

Code Sample:
	/* check if the file is a regular file */
	if (!S_ISREG(m->m_inode->i_mode))
		return -EACCES;

	/* check if the file is a directory */
	if (S_ISDIR(m->m_inode->i_mode))
		return -EACCES;
