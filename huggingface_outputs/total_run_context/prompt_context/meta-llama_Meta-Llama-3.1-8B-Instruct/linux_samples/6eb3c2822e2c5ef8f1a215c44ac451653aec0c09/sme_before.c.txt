 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a MAC spoofing attack. The ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask function is not properly validating the MAC addresses, allowing an attacker to discover the original MAC address after spoofing by sending a series of packets to MAC addresses with certain bit manipulations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper MAC address validation to prevent spoofing attacks.
2. Use a secure method to determine the set of MAC addresses on which the device is listening.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a secure MAC address validation library. 4. Regularly update the Linux kernel to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 5. Implement a secure MAC address validation mechanism in the ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask function. 6. Use a secure method to determine the set of MAC addresses on which the device is listening. 7. Regularly update the Linux kernel to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched. 8. Implement a secure MAC address validation mechanism in the ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask function. 9. Use a secure method to determine the set of MAC addresses on which
