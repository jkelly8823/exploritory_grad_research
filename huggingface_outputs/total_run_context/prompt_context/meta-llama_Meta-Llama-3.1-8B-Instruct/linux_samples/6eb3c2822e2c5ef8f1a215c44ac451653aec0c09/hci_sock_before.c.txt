 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-4579 vulnerability. The code checks the HCI_CHANNEL_RAW and HCI_CHANNEL_USER channels separately and does not use the BSSID masking approach to determine the set of MAC addresses on which a Wi-Fi device is listening.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it is secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-2108
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.7.1 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information or potentially read kernel memory by accessing the /proc/kallsyms file.

Code Sample:
	struct seq_file *file = NULL;
	struct seq_operations *ops = NULL;
	struct proc_dir_entry *pde = NULL;
	struct proc_dir_entry *pde_root = NULL;
	struct proc_dir_entry *pde_parent = NULL;
	struct proc_dir_entry *pde_child = NULL;
	struct proc_dir_entry *pde_siblings = NULL;
	struct proc
