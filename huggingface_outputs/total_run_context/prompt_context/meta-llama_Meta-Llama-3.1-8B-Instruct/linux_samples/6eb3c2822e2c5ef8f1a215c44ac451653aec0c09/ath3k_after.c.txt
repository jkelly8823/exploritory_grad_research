VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4579
CVE Description:
The ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask function in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_drv_main.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 uses a BSSID masking approach to determine the set of MAC addresses on which a Wi-Fi device is listening, which allows remote attackers to discover the original MAC address after spoofing by sending a series of packets to MAC addresses with certain bit manipulations. 

Code Sample:
	usb_dev = usb_find_device(usb_bus, usb_dev);
	if (usb_dev) {
		usb_dev->driver_info = BTUSB_ATH3012
