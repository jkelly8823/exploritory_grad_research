 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to memory corruption due to the potential for integer overflow when calculating the `macoff` variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially gain root privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to calculate `macoff`, such as using a larger data type or checking for potential overflows.
2. Consider using a bounds checking mechanism to ensure that `macoff` does not exceed the maximum allowed value.
3. Review the code to ensure that all potential integer overflows are handled properly.
