 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that handles Netlink messages or SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The memset function call is used to clear memory, and the xfrm_policy_put_afinfo function is used to release a reference to an afinfo structure. There is no indication that the code is vulnerable to the Netlink implementation issue described in CVE-2012-3520.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issue. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and to ensure that memory is properly cleared and released. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5195

		struct dentry *dentry;
		struct inode *inode;
		struct file_operations *fops;
