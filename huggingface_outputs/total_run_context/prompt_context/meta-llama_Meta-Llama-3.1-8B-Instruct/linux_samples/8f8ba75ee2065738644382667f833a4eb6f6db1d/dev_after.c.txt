 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The vulnerability is due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message. This allows a local attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The vulnerability is present in the function `deliver_skb` where it calls `skb_loop_sk` without checking if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the Netlink message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data before calling `skb_loop_sk`.
2. Implement a mechanism to verify the authenticity of Netlink messages, such as using a digital signature or a message authentication code (MAC).
3. Update the code to handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data properly, such as by dropping the message or returning an error. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as
