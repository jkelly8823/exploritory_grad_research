 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. This is because the code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the code checks for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message. The code does not check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing the message, which allows an attacker to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message before processing it.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the Netlink message.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent Netlink spoofing attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  VULNERABLE
