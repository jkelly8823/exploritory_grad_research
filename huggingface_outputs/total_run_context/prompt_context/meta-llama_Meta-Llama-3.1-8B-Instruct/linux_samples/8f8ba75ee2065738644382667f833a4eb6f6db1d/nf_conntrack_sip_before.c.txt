 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `digits_len` is called with user-controlled input `dptr` and `limit` as arguments. The function does not perform any bounds checking on these arguments, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is crafted to exceed the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the `digits_len` function to ensure that the input does not exceed the buffer size.
2. Use a safer function to calculate the length of the digits, such as `strlen` or `strnlen`.
3. Consider using a more secure function to handle user-controlled input, such as `snprintf` or `strncpy`. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.
