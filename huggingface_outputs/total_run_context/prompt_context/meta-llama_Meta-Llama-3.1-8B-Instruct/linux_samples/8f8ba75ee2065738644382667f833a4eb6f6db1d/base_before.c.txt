 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3520 because it exports the of_get_next_child function without proper validation of the SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This allows a local attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Validate the SCM_CREDENTIALS data before exporting the of_get_next_child function.
2.  Use the correct Netlink message handling to prevent spoofing attacks.
3.  Update the Linux kernel to version 3.2.30 or later to fix the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager. 

Note: The code sample is incomplete and does not contain the necessary information to accurately assess the vulnerability. However, based on the provided information, the code is still vulnerable to CVE-
