VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  The vulnerability is related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel, which is not present in the provided code sample. The code sample appears to be a configuration file for a network device, and
