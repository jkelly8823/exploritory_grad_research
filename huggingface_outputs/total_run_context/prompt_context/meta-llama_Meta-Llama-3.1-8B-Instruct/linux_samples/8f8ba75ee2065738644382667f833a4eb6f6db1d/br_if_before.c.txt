 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3520 vulnerability because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The code checks for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the line "if (!p || p->br!= br)", but this check is not sufficient to prevent spoofing of Netlink communication. The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user sending a crafted message to the Netlink socket.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing the message. This can be done by calling the `skc_cred()` function to retrieve the SCM_CREDENTIALS data from the socket.
2. Verify that the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is valid and matches the expected values before processing the message.
3. Consider using a more secure method to authenticate and authorize Netlink messages, such as using a digital signature or a secure authentication protocol.
