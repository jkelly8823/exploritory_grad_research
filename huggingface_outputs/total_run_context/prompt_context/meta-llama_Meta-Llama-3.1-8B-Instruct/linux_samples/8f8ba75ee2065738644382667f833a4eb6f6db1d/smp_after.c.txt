 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is checking for the availability of a resource (smp_chan_create) and if it is not available, it is reusing an existing resource (conn->smp_chan). This is a safe and expected behavior. The code is also properly handling the Netlink message by checking for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing it.
