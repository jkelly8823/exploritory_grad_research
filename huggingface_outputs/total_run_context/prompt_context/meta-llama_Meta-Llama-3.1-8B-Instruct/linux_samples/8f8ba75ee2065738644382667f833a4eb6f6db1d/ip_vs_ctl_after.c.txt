 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The __ip_vs_get_timeouts function is called without checking if the user has provided SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which is required to prevent spoofing attacks. This allows a local user to craft a message that can be used to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the user has provided SCM_CREDENTIALS data before calling __ip_vs_get_timeouts.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the user's identity before processing the message.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure socket. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2011-1764
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 2.6.38.8 does not properly validate the length of the user-space buffer in the __ip_vs_get_timeouts function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) via a crafted message.

Code Sample:
	{
		struct ip_vs_timeout_user t;

		memset(&t, 0, sizeof(t));
		__
