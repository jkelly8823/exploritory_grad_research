 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper handling of messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This allows a local user to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message. The specific lines that are vulnerable are 14 and 20, where the code checks for the presence of the "maddr=" and "received=" parameters in the message, respectively. However, it does not properly validate the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data, making it possible for an attacker to spoof the message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present in the message before processing it.
2. Validate the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data for all Netlink messages, not just those with the "maddr=" and "received=" parameters.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure socket or a message authentication code (MAC).
