 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The getsockopt function is called without checking if the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present in the message. This allows a local user to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message without SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present in the message before calling getsockopt.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the message.
3. Implement a mechanism to handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, such as returning an error or discarding the message. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
