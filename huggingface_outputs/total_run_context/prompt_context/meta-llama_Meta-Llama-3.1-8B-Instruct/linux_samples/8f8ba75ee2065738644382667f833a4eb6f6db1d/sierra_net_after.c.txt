 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function sierra_net_get_fw_attr() does not properly validate the length of the attrdata pointer before using it to access memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of attrdata is larger than the allocated buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the length of attrdata is within the allocated buffer size before using it to access memory.
2. Consider using a safer function to copy data from attrdata to the allocated buffer, such as memcpy() with a bounds check.
3. Consider using a memory-safe data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the data instead of a fixed-size buffer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.
