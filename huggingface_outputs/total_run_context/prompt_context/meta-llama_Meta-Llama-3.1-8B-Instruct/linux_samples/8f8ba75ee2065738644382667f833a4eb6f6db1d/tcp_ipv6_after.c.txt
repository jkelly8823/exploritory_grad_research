 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The vulnerability is due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message. This allows an attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks the necessary data. The vulnerability is present in the inet6_sk_rx_dst_set function, specifically in the lines where the dst and rt variables are assigned. These lines do not check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data, making it possible for an attacker to spoof the message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the inet6_sk_rx_dst_set function before assigning the dst and rt variables.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the Netlink message.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure protocol or encrypting the messages. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow
