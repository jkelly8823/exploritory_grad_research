 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Netlink spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2012-3520) because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This is evident in the function at76_dfu_get_state, where the return value of usb_control_msg is not checked for SCM_CREDENTIALS data before being returned.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of usb_control_msg for SCM_CREDENTIALS data before returning it.
2. Implement proper error handling for the usb_control_msg function to prevent potential Netlink spoofing attacks.
