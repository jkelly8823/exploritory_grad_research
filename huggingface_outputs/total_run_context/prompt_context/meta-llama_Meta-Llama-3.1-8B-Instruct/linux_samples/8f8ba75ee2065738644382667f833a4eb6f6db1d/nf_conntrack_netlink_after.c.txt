 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. In this code, the ctnetlink_nfqueue_parse function does not check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before parsing the Netlink message. This allows a local attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message without SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before parsing the Netlink message.
2. Use the nlattr_parse_nested function with the correct policy to ensure that the message is properly parsed.
3. Use the spin_lock_bh function to protect the critical section of code that accesses the nf_conntrack_lock. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (
