 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2012-3520) that allows local users to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling to the Netlink implementation.
2. Update the kernel to version 3.2.30 or later to fix the vulnerability.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent Netlink spoofing attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.
