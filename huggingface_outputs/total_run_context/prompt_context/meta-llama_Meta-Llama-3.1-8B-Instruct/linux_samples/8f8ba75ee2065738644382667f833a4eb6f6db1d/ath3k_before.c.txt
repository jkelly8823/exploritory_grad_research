 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. The code is a list of USB device IDs and their corresponding driver information. It does not involve any Netlink communication or message handling, which makes it unlikely to be vulnerable to CVE-2012-3520.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it is secure and functioning as expected. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
