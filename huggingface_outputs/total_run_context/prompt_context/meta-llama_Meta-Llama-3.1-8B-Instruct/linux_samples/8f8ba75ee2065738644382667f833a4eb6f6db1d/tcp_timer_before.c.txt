 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3520 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The code increments the statistics counter without checking if the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present, which could allow a local user to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present before incrementing the statistics counter.
2. Use the NET_INC_STATS_BH function with caution and ensure that it is used correctly to avoid similar vulnerabilities in the future. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using the NETLINK_CB macro to verify the source of the message. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling all possible scenarios and edge cases.  ```
