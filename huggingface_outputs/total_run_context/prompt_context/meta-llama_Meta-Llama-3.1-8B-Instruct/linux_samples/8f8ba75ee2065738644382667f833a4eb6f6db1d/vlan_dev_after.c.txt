 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. This is because the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. In the provided code, the function vlan_netpoll_send_skb() is called when netpoll is enabled. This function sends a Netlink message to the netpoll handler without checking if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This allows a local attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data before sending it to the netpoll handler.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the message.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure socket. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated
