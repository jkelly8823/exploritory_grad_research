 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. The code snippet is checking the length of a variable 'len' against the size of a structure 'tfrc' and then copying values from a structure 'hc' to the 'tfrc' structure. This does not seem to be related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3520.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that the length checks are correct and the data being copied is valid.  The code could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the variables being used. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) Network
