 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. This is because the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. In this code, the xfrm6_init_dst function is called without checking if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This allows a local user to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data before calling xfrm6_init_dst.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the message.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent Netlink spoofing attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  VULNERABLE: YES
