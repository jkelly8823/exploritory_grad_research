 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the Netlink implementation vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3520. The code appears to be a list of USB device IDs and their corresponding driver information, which does not involve Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the Netlink implementation vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and to regularly review the code for potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  Code Sample: 
	{ USB_DEVICE(0x0a5c, 0x21e6) },
	{ USB_DEVICE(0x0a5c, 0x21e
