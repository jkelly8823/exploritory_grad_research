 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The vulnerability is due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message. This allows an attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks the necessary data. The vulnerability is present in the line where the code checks for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This can be done by adding a check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink message and handling it accordingly. Additionally, the code should be modified to properly validate the Netlink message to prevent spoofing attacks. This can be done by verifying the source and destination addresses of the Netlink message. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a
