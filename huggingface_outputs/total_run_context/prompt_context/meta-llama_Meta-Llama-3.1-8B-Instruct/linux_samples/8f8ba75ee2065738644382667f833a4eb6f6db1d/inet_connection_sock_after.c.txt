 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The vulnerability is due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the message. This allows a local user to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message. The vulnerable lines are 9-11, where the message is processed without checking for SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the message before processing it.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the message.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent Netlink spoofing attacks.
