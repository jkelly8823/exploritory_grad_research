 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Netlink spoofing vulnerability (CVE-2012-3520) because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The vulnerability is present in the line where the ip_select_ident function is called, as it does not verify the authenticity of the message before processing it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to verify the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before calling ip_select_ident.
2. Implement a mechanism to authenticate the message before processing it.
3. Consider using a secure communication channel, such as IPsec, to prevent spoofing attacks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  Code Sample: 
	iph->ihl = 5;
	iph->tos = inet->tos;
	iph->frag_off
