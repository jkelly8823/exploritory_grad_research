 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3520 because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The vulnerability is present in the tcp_v6_hash function where it checks if the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present before processing the message. However, this check is not sufficient as it only checks if the data is present, but does not verify its integrity. This allows an attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message that lacks SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to verify the integrity of the SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing the message.
2. Use a secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure protocol or encrypting the messages.
3. Update the code to properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, such as by ignoring them or returning an error. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof
