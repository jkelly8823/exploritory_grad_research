 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability CVE-2012-3520. The vulnerability is related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel and involves spoofing Netlink communication. The code sample appears to be related to TCP/IP stack and does not involve Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3520. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and follow secure coding practices. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000001
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's TCP stack allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DOS) by sending a specially crafted packet that triggers a TCP retransmit timeout.

Code Sample:

		if (tcp->mss_clamp!= 0) {
			tcp->mss = min(tcp->mss, tcp->mss_clamp);
		}

		if (tcp->mss > 0) {
			tcp->mss = min(tcp->mss
