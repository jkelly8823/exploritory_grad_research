 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel, which is not present in the code sample. The code sample appears to be a documentation snippet describing how to receive kernel messages, and does not contain any code that could be exploited to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that any code that interacts with the Linux kernel is properly secured and follows best practices for secure coding. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the Linux kernel up to date with the latest security patches.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  Code Sample: 
```python
import socket

def receive_kernel_messages
