 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3520 because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The ath9k_hw_intrpend function is called without checking if the message contains SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the message contains SCM_CREDENTIALS data before calling ath9k_hw_intrpend.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using the nlmsg_parse function to parse the message and extract the SCM_CREDENTIALS data. 
3. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.2.30 or later to fix the vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  The vulnerability is due
