 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. The code snippet seems to be part of a routing table management function, and it does not involve any Netlink communication. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3520.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security risks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000367
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.11.3 does not properly validate the length of the user-controlled data in the `struct mmsghdr` structure, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted `recvmmsg` system call.

Code Sample:
		struct mmsghdr *mmsg;
		struct msghdr msg;
		struct iovec iov;
		int ret;
		int i;
		int len
