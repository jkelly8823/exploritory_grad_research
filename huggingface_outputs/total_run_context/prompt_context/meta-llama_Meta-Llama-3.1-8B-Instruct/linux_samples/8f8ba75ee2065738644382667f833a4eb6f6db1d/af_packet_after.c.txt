 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. This is because the code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The match_fanout_group function checks if the packet type's af_packet_priv matches the fanout group's fanout, but it does not check if the packet type's af_packet_priv is NULL. This allows an attacker to spoof a packet type by setting its af_packet_priv to NULL, which would then be matched by the match_fanout_group function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the packet type's af_packet_priv is NULL before comparing it to the fanout group's fanout.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the packet type's af_packet_priv.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent Netlink spoofing attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated
