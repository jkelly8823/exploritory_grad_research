 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. The code snippet seems to be handling network polling and device management, which does not match the description of the vulnerability (CVE-2012-3520). The code does not contain any obvious references to SCM_CREDENTIALS data or Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential issues. Consider adding additional checks and error handling to ensure the code is robust and secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  Code Sample: 
int foo(int x) { 
    int y = x; 
    return y;
