EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability CVE-2012-3520. The vulnerability is related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel and involves spoofing Netlink communication. The code sample appears to be related to Ethernet settings and does not involve Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure and free of vulnerabilities.  The code sample appears to be a part of a larger system and should be reviewed in the context of the entire system to ensure it is secure.  Additionally, the code sample uses a switch statement to handle different Ethernet speeds, which is a good practice.  However, it would be beneficial to add error checking to handle unexpected values for the speed variable.  This would help prevent potential issues if the speed variable is not set correctly.  It would also be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of the code and the variables used.  This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.  Finally, it would be beneficial
