 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack. The issue arises from the fact that the code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This allows a local attacker to spoof Netlink communication by crafting a message. The specific line of code that introduces this vulnerability is the one that checks if the packet length is greater than the MTU and then frees the skb if it is. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent spoofing attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present in the message before processing it.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent spoofing attacks, such as verifying the source of the message and checking for any anomalies in the message content.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol for Netlink communication, such as using encryption or digital signatures to authenticate the messages.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof
