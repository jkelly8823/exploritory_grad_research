 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. The code snippet seems to be part of a routing table management function, and it does not involve any Netlink communication. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the described CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly audited and tested to prevent any potential security risks.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  Code Sample:
		if (net->loopback_dev == NULL) {
		err = -ENODEV;
		goto out;
		}
		if (net->loopback_dev->ifindex == 0)
