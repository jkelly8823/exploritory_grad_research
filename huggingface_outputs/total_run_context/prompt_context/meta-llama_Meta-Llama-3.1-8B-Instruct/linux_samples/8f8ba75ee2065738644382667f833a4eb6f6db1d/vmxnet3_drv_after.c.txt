VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager. 

Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	if (x > 10) {
		printf("x is greater than 10\n");
	} else {
		printf("x is less than or equal to 10\n");
	}
