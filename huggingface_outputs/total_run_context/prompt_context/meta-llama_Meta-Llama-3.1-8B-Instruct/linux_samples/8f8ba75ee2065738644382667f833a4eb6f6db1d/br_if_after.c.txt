 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3520 vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. In this code, the err variable is checked, but it does not check if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This can be exploited by a local user to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the message has SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing it.
2. Use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the message.
3. Implement proper error handling to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.
