 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel. The code snippet is focused on TCP Cookie Transactions, which is a different aspect of the Linux kernel. The lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling is specific to the Netlink implementation and does not seem to be present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the vulnerability described in the CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues related to TCP Cookie Transactions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.

Code Sample:
		struct sk_buff *skb = dev_hard_header(skb, dev, eth_type_trans(skb, dev), NULL, NULL, 0);
		struct sk_buff *skb2 = skb_clone(skb, GFP_KERNEL);

This concludes
