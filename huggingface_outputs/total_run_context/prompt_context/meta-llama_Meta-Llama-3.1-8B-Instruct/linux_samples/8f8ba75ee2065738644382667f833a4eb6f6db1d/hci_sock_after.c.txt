VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000364
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.11.3 does not properly validate the length of the data in the i915_gem_execbuffer2 ioctl, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ioctl call.

Code Sample:
	*skb = llvmpipe_alloc_skb(0, 0);
	if (!skb)
		return -ENOMEM;
	*skb->len = 0;
