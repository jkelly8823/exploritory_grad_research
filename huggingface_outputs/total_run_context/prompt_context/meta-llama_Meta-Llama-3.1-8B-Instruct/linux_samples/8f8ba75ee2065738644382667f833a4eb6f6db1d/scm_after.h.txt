 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3520. The vulnerability is related to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a part of the Unix socket implementation and does not handle Netlink messages.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the vulnerability and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities or security issues.  The code sample does not handle the case where msg->msg_controllen is negative, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow. It is recommended to add a check for this case and handle it appropriately.  Additionally, the code sample does not check the return value of unix_get_peersec_dgram, which could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. It is recommended to check the return value and handle it appropriately.  It is also recommended to review the code for any other potential security issues.  The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the specific vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3520, but it is still recommended to
