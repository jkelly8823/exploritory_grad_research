 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition. The function hci_resolve_next_name(hdev) is called before checking if the connection is already in the BT_CONFIG state. This could potentially lead to a situation where the connection is already in the BT_CONFIG state, but the function hci_resolve_next_name(hdev) is still called, resulting in unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the call to hci_resolve_next_name(hdev) after checking if the connection is already in the BT_CONFIG state.
2. Consider adding a lock to prevent concurrent access to the connection state. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
