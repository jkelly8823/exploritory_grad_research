 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3520 vulnerability because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This is evident in the function calls to llc_sap_handler and llc_conn_handler, which do not check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the skb structure. This allows a local user to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the skb structure before calling llc_sap_handler and llc_conn_handler.
2. Implement proper error handling to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure socket. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  VUL
