 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-3520 vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. In the given code, the line "if (NULL == siocb->scm)" is vulnerable because it does not check if the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present before proceeding. This allows a local user to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message. The same vulnerability is present in the second occurrence of the same line.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is present before proceeding. This can be done by adding a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS in the if condition.
2. Initialize the scm structure before using it. This can be done by adding a line to initialize the scm structure before the if condition. 
3. Remove the duplicate code. The second occurrence of the code is unnecessary and can be removed.
