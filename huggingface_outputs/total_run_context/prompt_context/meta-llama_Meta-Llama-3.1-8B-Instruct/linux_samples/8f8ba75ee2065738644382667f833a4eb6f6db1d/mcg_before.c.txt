VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  The code sample provided does not contain any code that handles Netlink messages or SCM_CREDENTIALS data, so it is not vulnerable to this issue.  However, it is worth noting that the code does use kmalloc to allocate memory, which could
