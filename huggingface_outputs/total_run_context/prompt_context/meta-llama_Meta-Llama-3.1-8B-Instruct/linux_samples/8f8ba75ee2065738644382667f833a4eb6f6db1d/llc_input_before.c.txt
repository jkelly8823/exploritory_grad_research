 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. In the function llc_add_pack, the line "llc_type_handlers[type - 1] = handler;" assigns a new handler to the llc_type_handlers array. However, in the function llc_remove_pack, the line "llc_type_handlers[type - 1] = NULL;" sets the corresponding handler to NULL. This can cause a null pointer dereference when the llc_pdu_type function tries to access the handler at the index "dest - 1" in the llc_type_handlers array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the handler is NULL before accessing it.
2. Use a more robust data structure, such as a hash table, to store the handlers.
3. Add a check to ensure that the type is valid before accessing the handler.
