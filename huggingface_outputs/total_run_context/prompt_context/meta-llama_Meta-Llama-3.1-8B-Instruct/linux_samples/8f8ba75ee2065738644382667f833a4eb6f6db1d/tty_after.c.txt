 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code is allocating memory for a struct using kzalloc and then checking if the allocation was successful. This is a proper way to handle memory allocation in the Linux kernel. The code does not seem to be handling Netlink messages or any other type of message that could be spoofed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is properly handling memory allocation and does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is always a good practice to check for memory allocation failures and handle them properly. In this case, the code is already doing that. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.

Code Sample:

	struct netlink_skb_parms *parms = &skb->cb[NETLINK_CB(skb).portid];
	if (
