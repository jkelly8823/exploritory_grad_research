 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is allocating memory for a struct and then checking if the allocation was successful. The Netlink implementation vulnerability is related to the handling of messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to check for memory allocation failures and handle them properly. In this case, the code is returning -ENOMEM if the allocation fails, which is a good practice. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-5195
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.8 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from other users by reading the /proc/<pid>/maps file.

Code Sample:

	struct file *file;
	struct path *path;
	struct dentry *dentry;

	file = filp_open("/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY, 0);
	if (IS_ERR(file))
		return -ENOMEM;

	path = get_file_path(file);
	if (IS_ERR(path))
