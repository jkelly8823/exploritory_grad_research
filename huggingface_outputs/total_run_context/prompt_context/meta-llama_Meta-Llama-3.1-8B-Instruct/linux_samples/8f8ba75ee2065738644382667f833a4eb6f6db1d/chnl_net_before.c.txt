 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code is checking the version of IP and handling it accordingly, but it does not involve Netlink communication or the handling of SCM_CREDENTIALS data. The vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3520 is specific to the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel and does not seem to be relevant to this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address this vulnerability.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000367
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.13.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the netfilter subsystem, where a netfilter hook is freed while still being used by the nf_hook_slow function.

Code Sample:

	/* check the version of IP */
	ip_version = skb_header_pointer(skb, 0, 1, &buf);

	switch (*ip_version >> 4) {
	case 4:
		skb->protocol = htons(ETH_P_IP);

		/* check if the packet is a fragment */
		if (
