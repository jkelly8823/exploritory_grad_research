 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 14-16, 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel (CVE-2012-3520). The code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which allows local users to spoof Netlink communication. The vulnerability is present in the team_port_enable_netpoll function, which is called in the team_netpoll_setup function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling to the team_port_enable_netpoll function to prevent Netlink spoofing attacks.
2. Update the team_netpoll_setup function to properly handle errors and cleanup resources in case of an error.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle Netlink messages, such as using a secure Netlink socket. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink
