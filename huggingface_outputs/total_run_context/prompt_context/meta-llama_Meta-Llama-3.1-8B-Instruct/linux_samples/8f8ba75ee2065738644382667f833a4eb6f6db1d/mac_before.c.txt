 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling. This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability. The code does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink messages.
2. Implement proper handling for messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data.
3. Update the code to use the SCM_CREDENTIALS data to verify the authenticity of the Netlink messages. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  This vulnerability is a local privilege escalation vulnerability.  The vulnerability is due to the lack of SCM_CREDENTIALS data handling in the Netlink implementation.  The Netlink
