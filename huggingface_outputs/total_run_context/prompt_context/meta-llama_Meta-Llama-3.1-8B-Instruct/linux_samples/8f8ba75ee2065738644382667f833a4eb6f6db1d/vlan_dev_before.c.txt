 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3520 because it does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This is evident in the vlan_dev_hard_start_xmit function where it does not check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing the message.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing the message in the vlan_dev_hard_start_xmit function.
2. Ensure that the SCM_CREDENTIALS data is properly handled and validated to prevent spoofing of Netlink communication. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.  The vulnerability is due to the lack of a check for SCM_CREDENTIALS data in the Netlink implementation.  This allows an attacker to send a crafted message that lacks SCM_CREDENTIALS data,
