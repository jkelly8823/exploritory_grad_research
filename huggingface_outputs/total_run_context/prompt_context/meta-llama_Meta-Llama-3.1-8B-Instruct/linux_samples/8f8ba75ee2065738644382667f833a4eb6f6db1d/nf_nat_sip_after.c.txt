 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Netlink spoofing attack due to the lack of proper handling of messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30, as described in CVE-2012-3520. The code does not check for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing Netlink messages, which allows an attacker to spoof Netlink communication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 3.2.30 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper handling of messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, such as checking for the presence of SCM_CREDENTIALS data before processing Netlink messages.
3. Use a secure method to verify the authenticity of Netlink messages, such as using a digital signature or a secure hash. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3520
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a
