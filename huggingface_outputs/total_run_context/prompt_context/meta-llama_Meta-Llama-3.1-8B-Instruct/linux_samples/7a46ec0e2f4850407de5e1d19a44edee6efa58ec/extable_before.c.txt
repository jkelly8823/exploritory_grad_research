 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly relates to the join_session_keyring function or the keyctl commands mentioned in the CVE description. The code appears to be related to exception handling in the Linux kernel, which is a different component. Therefore, it is unlikely that this code is vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to follow secure coding practices.
