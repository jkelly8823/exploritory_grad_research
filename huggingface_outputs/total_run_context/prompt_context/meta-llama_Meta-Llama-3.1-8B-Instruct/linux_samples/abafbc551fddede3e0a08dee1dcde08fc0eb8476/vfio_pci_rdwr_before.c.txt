 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel through 5.6.13 mishandling attempts to access disabled memory space. This is because the code does not properly check if the memory space is disabled before accessing it. The lines 14-15 are where the code accesses the memory space without checking if it is disabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the memory space is enabled before accessing it. This can be done by calling the `vfio_pci_is_enabled()` function to check if the memory space is enabled.
2. If the memory space is not enabled, return an error code to indicate that the operation cannot be performed.
```rust
if (bar == PCI_ROM_RESOURCE) {
	/*
	 * The ROM can fill less space than the BAR, so we start the
	 * excluded range at the end of the actual ROM.  This makes
	 * filling large ROM BARs much faster.
	 */
	io = pci_map_rom(pdev, &x_start);
	if (!io)
		return -ENOMEM;
	x_end = end;
} else {
	int ret = vfio_pci
