EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak. The free(sys) call is made after the for loop, but it is also made inside the if statement. This means that if the if statement is true, the free(sys) call will be made before the for loop is completed, resulting in a resource leak. The free(sys) call should be moved outside the if statement to ensure that it is only called once.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Move the free(sys) call outside the if statement, like so:
		for (x=0; x < count; x++) {
			size = read8(pevent);
			ret = read_event_file(pevent, sys, size);
			if (ret) {
				return ret;
			}
		}
		free(sys);
	}
	return 0; 
This will ensure that the resource is only freed once, after the for loop has completed.  This will prevent a resource leak.  Additionally, it would be a good idea to check the return value of free(sys) to ensure that it was successful.  This can be done by checking if free(sys) returns NULL.  If it does return NULL
