 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) due to the incorrect buffer size used in the crypto_rng_reset function. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2016-7042) that can be exploited by reading the /proc/keys file when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the crypto_rng_reset function to use the correct buffer size.
2. Use a secure method to seed the RNG, such as using a trusted random number generator.
3. Consider enabling the stack protector for the crypto_rng_reset function to prevent stack-based buffer overflow attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-7042
CVE Description:
The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file.
