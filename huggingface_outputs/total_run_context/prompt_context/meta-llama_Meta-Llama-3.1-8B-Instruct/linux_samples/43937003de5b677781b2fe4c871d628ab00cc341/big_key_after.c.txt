 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) due to the incorrect buffer size used in the proc_keys_show function. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2. The proc_keys_show function is not present in the provided code, but the vulnerability is related to the use of the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector. The code uses the crypto_alloc_rng and crypto_alloc_skcipher functions, which can lead to a stack overflow if the buffer size is not correctly set.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability (e.g., 4.8.3 or later).
2. Disable the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector if it is not necessary.
3. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that buffer sizes are correctly set and checked. 
4. Consider using a memory-safe programming language or a framework that provides memory safety guarantees. 
5. Review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and ensure that all buffer sizes are correctly set and checked. 
6. Consider using a static analysis
