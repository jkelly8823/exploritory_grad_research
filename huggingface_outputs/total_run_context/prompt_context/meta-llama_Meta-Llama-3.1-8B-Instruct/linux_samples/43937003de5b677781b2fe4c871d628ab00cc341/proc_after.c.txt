 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) due to the incorrect buffer size used for certain timeout data. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel (CVE-2016-7042) that can be exploited by reading the /proc/keys file when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the buffer size used for timeout data is correct.
2. Disable the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector or apply the necessary patches to fix the vulnerability.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the /proc/keys file.  ```bash
