 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack due to the improper copying of data in the evm_verify_hmac function. This allows local users to forge MAC values by exploiting the timing difference in the execution of the memcmp function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a constant-time comparison function, such as memcmp_const_time, to prevent timing attacks.
2. Consider using a secure hash function, such as SHA-256, to improve the security of the HMAC calculation.
3. Review and update the evm_verify_hmac function to ensure that it properly copies data and prevents timing attacks.
