 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack due to the improper copying of data in the evm_verify_hmac function. This allows a local user to forge MAC values by exploiting the timing difference in the verification process.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a constant-time comparison function to prevent timing attacks.
2. Ensure that the data is properly copied before verification to prevent any potential side-channel attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-2085
CVE Description:
The evm_verify_hmac function in security/integrity/evm/evm_main.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5 does not properly copy data, which makes it easier for local users to forge MAC values via a timing side-channel attack.  VULNERABLE: YES
