 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-8134 because it sets pv_info.paravirt_enabled to 1 without checking if the current kernel is a KVM guest kernel. This allows a guest OS user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the current kernel is a KVM guest kernel before setting pv_info.paravirt_enabled to 1.
2. Use a secure method to determine the paravirt_enabled setting, such as using the KVM_FEATURE_CLOCKSOURCE_STABLE_BIT feature. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to set the paravirt_enabled setting, such as using a kernel module parameter.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-10033
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.8.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from the /proc/[pid]/maps file.

Code Sample:
struct file *file;
struct path path;
struct vm_area_struct *vma;
struct mm_struct
