 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a MAC spoofing attack. The ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask function uses a BSSID masking approach to determine the set of MAC addresses on which a Wi-Fi device is listening. However, the function does not properly validate the MAC addresses, allowing an attacker to discover the original MAC address after spoofing by sending a series of packets to MAC addresses with certain bit manipulations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the MAC addresses before using them in the BSSID masking approach.
2. Use a secure method to determine the set of MAC addresses on which the device is listening.
3. Consider using a more secure MAC address validation method, such as using a hash function to verify the MAC address. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4579
CVE Description:
The ath9k_htc_set_bssid_mask function in drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_drv_main.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 uses a BSSID masking approach to determine the set of MAC addresses on which a Wi-Fi device is
