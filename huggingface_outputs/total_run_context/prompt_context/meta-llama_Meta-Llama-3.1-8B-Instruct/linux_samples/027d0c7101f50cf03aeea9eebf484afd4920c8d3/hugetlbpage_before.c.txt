 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code does not check for an error after calling pmd_alloc() function which can return NULL if the function fails. This can lead to a resultant NULL pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of pmd_alloc() function and handle the error accordingly.
2. Use a pointer to check for NULL before dereferencing it. For example, if (pmdp!= NULL) {... } 
3. Consider using a safer function that does not return NULL in case of failure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CWE_ID: 476
CWE Description:
The program does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference.

Code Sample:
		if (pmdp!= NULL) {
			pmdp = pmd_alloc(mm, pudp, addr);
			if (pmdp!= NULL) {
				WARN_ON(addr & (sz - 1));
				/*... */
			}
		}
