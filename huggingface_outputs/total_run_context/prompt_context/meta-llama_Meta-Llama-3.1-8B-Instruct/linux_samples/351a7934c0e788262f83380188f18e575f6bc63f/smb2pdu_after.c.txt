 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the given CVE description. The code appears to be handling SMB2 protocol negotiation and setting various server parameters based on the response from the server. There is no indication of uncached write operations or handling of crafted pointers, which are the primary concerns of the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the given vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to validate the SecurityMode as mentioned in the code comment to ensure it is within expected values. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.

Code Sample:

	int writev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov,
