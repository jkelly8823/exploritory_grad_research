 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0069 vulnerability. This is because the function pointer get_acl is not properly checked for NULL before being dereferenced. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the get_acl function pointer for NULL before dereferencing it.
2. Use a secure coding practice to ensure that function pointers are properly checked for NULL before use.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to function pointers, such as a callback function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted
