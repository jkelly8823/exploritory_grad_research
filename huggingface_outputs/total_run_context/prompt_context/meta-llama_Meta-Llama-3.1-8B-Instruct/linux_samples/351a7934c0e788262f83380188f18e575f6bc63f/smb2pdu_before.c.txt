 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that directly corresponds to the vulnerability description. The vulnerability is related to the handling of uncached write operations in the cifs_iovec_write function, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be related to SMB2 protocol negotiation and does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE description. However, it is recommended to validate the SecurityMode as mentioned in the code comment to ensure proper security settings. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.

Code Sample:

	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 10
