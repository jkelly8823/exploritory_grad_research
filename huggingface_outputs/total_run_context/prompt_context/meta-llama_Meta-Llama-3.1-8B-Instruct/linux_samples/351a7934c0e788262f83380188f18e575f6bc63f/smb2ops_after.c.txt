VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7, 12-13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the use of min_t function which can lead to integer underflow. The min_t function is used to ensure that the wsize and rsize variables do not exceed the maximum buffer size value that can be sent with 1 credit. However, if the server->max_write or server->max_read is set to a value less than SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, it can lead to an integer underflow when the min_t function is called. This can cause the wsize or rsize variable to be set to a value less than the intended value, potentially leading to information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the server->max_write and server->max_read values to ensure they are not less than SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE before passing them to the min_t function.
2. Consider using a safer function, such as clamp_t, to ensure that the wsize and rsize variables are not set to values less than the intended value. 
3. Add error handling to handle the case where the server->max_write or server->max_read is set to a value less than
