VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1002101
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) by reading or writing to a /proc filesystem entry.

Code Sample:

struct proc_dir_entry *proc_mkdir(const char *name, struct proc_dir_entry *parent,
				  mode_t mode, const struct proc_ops *proc_ops,
				  void *data);
struct proc_dir_entry *proc_mkdir_data(const char *name,
