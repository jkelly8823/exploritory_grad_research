 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any direct implementation of the cifs_iovec_write function or its related functionality. The code appears to be a header file containing macro definitions for SMB2 and SMB3 protocol sizes. The vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0069 is specific to the Linux kernel's cifs file system implementation, which is not present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any vulnerable code and does not require any fixes. However, it is essential to ensure that any code implementing the cifs_iovec_write function or related functionality adheres to secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.
