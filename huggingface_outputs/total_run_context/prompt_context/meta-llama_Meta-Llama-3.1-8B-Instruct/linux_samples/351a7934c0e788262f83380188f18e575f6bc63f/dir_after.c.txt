 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) due to the improper handling of uncached write operations. The cifs_iovec_write function does not properly handle write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which can lead to sensitive information being leaked from kernel memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the cifs_iovec_write function to properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes.
2. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent such write operations.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling write operations, such as using a secure buffer. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.  The code sample provided does
