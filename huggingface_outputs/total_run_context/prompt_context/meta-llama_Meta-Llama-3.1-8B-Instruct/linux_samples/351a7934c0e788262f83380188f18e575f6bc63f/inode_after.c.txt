 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly relates to the cifs_iovec_write function or the uncached write operations that are vulnerable to the described issue. The function cifs_get_inode_info appears to be a part of the CIFS protocol implementation and does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described issue. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested and validated. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and updates.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer
