 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the uncached write operations. The cifs_iovec_write function does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Use a secure method to handle uncached write operations, such as using a secure buffer to store the data being written.
2.  Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the copying of fewer than the requested number of bytes.
3.  Use a secure method to handle the writev system call, such as validating the pointer before copying data.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause
