 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any code that directly handles uncached write operations. The cifs_iovec_write function is not present in this code snippet. The code snippet appears to be handling read and write size limits for a CIFS volume, but it does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0069.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues related to the handling of write and read operations, as well as the use of the min_t function to limit the size of these operations. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service
