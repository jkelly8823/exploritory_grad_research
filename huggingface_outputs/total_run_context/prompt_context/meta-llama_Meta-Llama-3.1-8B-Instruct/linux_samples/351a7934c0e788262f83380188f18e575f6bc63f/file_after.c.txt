 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer. This is due to the fact that the cifs_iovec_write function does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes. This can lead to sensitive information being obtained from kernel memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper error handling for uncached write operations.
2. Validate the iovec pointer to prevent crafted pointer attacks.
3. Use a secure method to handle kernel memory access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0069
CVE Description:
The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.
