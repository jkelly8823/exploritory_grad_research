RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that it is up-to-date and follows best practices for secure coding. Additionally, it is recommended to review the surrounding code and ensure that it does not indirectly introduce the vulnerability.  Further analysis of the surrounding code and the kernel version being used is required to confirm the absence of this vulnerability.  It is also recommended to apply the patch for CVE-2014-0069 if the kernel version is affected.  The patch can be found in the Linux kernel source code repository.  It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice and follow the secure coding guidelines to prevent such vulnerabilities in the future.
