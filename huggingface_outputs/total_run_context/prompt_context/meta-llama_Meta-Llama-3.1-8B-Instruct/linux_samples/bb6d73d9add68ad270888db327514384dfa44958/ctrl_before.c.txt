 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8, 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2023-25775 due to improper access control. The issue arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate the `info->page_size` value, allowing an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via network access. The repeated checks for `info->page_size` values are unnecessary and can be simplified.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Simplify the code by removing the repeated checks and directly assigning the `page_size` value based on the `info->page_size` value.
2. Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
3. Update the code to use a more secure method for validating user input, such as using a whitelist of allowed values.
