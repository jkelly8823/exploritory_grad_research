 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the line cfg->scan_request = NULL; which sets the scan_request pointer to NULL before it is used in the subsequent lines. This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior when the code tries to access the scan_request pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the line cfg->scan_request = NULL; to after the scan_request is no longer needed, or
2. Use a temporary variable to store the value of cfg->scan_request before setting it to NULL, and then use the temporary variable instead of cfg->scan_request in the subsequent lines. 
3. Consider using a more robust way to handle the scan_request pointer, such as using a smart pointer or a reference counting mechanism.

CVE Description:
The brcm80211 component in the Linux kernel through 6.5.10 has a brcmf_cfg80211_detach use-after-free in the device unplugging (disconnect the USB by hotplug) code. For physically proximate attackers with local access, this "could be exploited in
