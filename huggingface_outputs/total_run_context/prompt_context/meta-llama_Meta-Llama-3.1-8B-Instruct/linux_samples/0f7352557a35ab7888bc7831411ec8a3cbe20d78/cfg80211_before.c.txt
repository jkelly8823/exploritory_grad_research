 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the line cfg->scan_request = NULL;. This line sets the scan_request pointer to NULL before it is used in the subsequent lines. This can lead to a use-after-free bug when the code tries to access the scan_request pointer after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the line cfg->scan_request = NULL; to after the kfree(cfg); line to ensure that the scan_request pointer is not accessed after the cfg structure has been freed.
2. Consider using a more robust way to handle the scan_request pointer, such as using a smart pointer or a reference counting mechanism, to prevent use-after-free bugs. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all pointers are properly handled and freed to prevent similar use-after-free bugs.  ```
