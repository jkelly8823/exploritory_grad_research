 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-2732. This vulnerability is a result of a flaw in the way the KVM hypervisor handles instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualization is enabled. The code does not properly handle the case where an L2 guest tricks the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle the case where an L2 guest tricks the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent the L2 guest from accessing sensitive L1 resources.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling instruction emulation, such as using a separate VMCS for the L2 guest.
