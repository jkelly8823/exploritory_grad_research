 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described CVE. The code appears to be related to configuration settings for a virtualization environment, but it does not include any code that would be susceptible to the L2 guest tricking the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire system to ensure that there are no other vulnerabilities present. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the configuration settings are properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.  Code Sample:
```c
int kvm_vcpu_ioctl_get_supported_cpuid_leafs(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
