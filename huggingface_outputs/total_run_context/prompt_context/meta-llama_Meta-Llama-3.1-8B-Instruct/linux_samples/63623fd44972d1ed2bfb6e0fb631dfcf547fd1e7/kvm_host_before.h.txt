VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-2732 vulnerability. This is because the code is using the vzalloc function which is not properly checked for null pointer dereferences. The vzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the KVM hypervisor, but it is not properly checked for null pointer dereferences, which can lead to a null pointer dereference when the function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of the vzalloc function to ensure that it is not null before using it.
2. Use a safer alternative to vzalloc, such as kmalloc or kzalloc, which are designed to handle null pointer dereferences.
3. Add a null pointer check before calling the vzalloc function to prevent null pointer dereferences. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest
