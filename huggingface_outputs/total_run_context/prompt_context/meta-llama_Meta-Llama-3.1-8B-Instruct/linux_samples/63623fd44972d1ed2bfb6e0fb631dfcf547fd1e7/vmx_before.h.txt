 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-2732 vulnerability. This is because the code is handling instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled, which is a key component of the vulnerability. The code is also accessing sensitive L1 resources, which is another key component of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle the instruction emulation for the L2 guest and prevent it from accessing sensitive L1 resources. This can be achieved by implementing additional checks and validation to ensure that the L2 guest does not attempt to access L1 resources. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly handling the nested virtualisation scenario. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.  VULNERABLE: YES
