 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-2732 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. The function `get_vmcs12` is missing a check for the `PIN_BASED_VIRTUAL_NMIS` flag, which is a sensitive L1 resource that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the `PIN_BASED_VIRTUAL_NMIS` flag in the `get_vmcs12` function to ensure that it is not accessed by the L2 guest.
2. Update the `nested_cpu_has_ept` function to properly check for the `SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_EPT` flag in the `vmcs12` structure.
3. Review the code to ensure that all sensitive L1 resources are properly protected from access by the L2 guest.
