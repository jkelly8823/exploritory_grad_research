 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential information leak due to the way it handles instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. The code does not properly check for sensitive L1 resources being accessed by the L2 guest, which could lead to a flaw in the way the KVM hypervisor handles instruction emulation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement additional checks to ensure that sensitive L1 resources are not accessed by the L2 guest.
2. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles instruction emulation for nested virtualisation.
3. Consider using a more secure calling convention for the fastop functions to prevent potential information leaks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.  This vulnerability is related to the code provided.  The code does not properly check for sensitive L1 resources being accessed by the
