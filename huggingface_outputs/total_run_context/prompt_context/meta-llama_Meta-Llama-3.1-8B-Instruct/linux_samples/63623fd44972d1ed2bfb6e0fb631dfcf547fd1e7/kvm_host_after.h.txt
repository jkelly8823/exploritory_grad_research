 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-2732 vulnerability because it is missing the necessary architecture-specific code for vzalloc. The __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_VM_ALLOC macro is not defined, which means that the code is not properly allocating memory for the VM. This can lead to a vulnerability where an L2 guest can trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Define the __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_VM_ALLOC macro for the architecture being used.
2. Implement the necessary architecture-specific code for vzalloc.
3. Review the code to ensure that it is properly allocating memory for the VM. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.  ``` Shelley
