 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the given CVE description. The code appears to be handling EOI (End of Interrupt) MSR values and setting pending interrupts, but it does not involve nested virtualization or L1/L2 guest resource access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure and functioning as intended. Consider using static analysis tools and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.  Code Sample:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int arr[10];
    int *ptr = arr;
    for (int i = 0; i <
