 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-2732 because it does not properly handle the instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. The kvm_rip_write function is called without proper validation, which can lead to sensitive L1 resources being accessed by the L2 guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper validation to the kvm_rip_write function to ensure that it only writes to valid L1 resources.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent the L2 guest from tricking the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling instruction emulation, such as using a separate emulation engine for the L2 guest. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest.
