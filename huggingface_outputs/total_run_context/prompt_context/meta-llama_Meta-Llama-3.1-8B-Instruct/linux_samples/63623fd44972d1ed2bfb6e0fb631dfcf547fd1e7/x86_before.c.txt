 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-2732 because it allows an L2 guest to trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement additional checks to ensure that the L2 guest does not access sensitive L1 resources.
2. Update the code to properly handle instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling instruction emulation, such as using a separate emulation engine for L2 guests.
