VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest. 

Code Sample:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    gets(buffer);
    return 0;
}
```
