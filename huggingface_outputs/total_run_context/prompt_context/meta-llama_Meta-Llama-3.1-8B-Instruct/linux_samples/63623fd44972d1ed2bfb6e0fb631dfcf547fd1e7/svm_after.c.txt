VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a flaw in the way that the KVM hypervisor handles instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. This is due to the lack of proper validation of the L2 guest's access to sensitive L1 resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation of the L2 guest's access to sensitive L1 resources.
2. Use a secure method to handle instruction emulation for L2 guests when nested virtualisation is enabled.
3. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date. VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-2732
CVE Description:
A flaw was discovered in the way that the KVM hypervisor handled instruction emulation for an L2 guest when nested virtualisation is enabled. Under some circumstances, an L2 guest may trick the L0 guest into accessing sensitive L1 resources that should be inaccessible to the L2 guest. VULNERABLE: YES
