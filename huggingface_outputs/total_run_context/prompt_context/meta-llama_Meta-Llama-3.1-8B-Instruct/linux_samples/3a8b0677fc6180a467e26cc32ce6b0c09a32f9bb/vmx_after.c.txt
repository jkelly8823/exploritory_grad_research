 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-1000252. The vulnerability is related to an out-of-bounds guest_irq value, but the code checks if the guest_irq is within the valid range before proceeding. Additionally, the code checks if the irq_rt->nr_rt_entries is valid before accessing it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure against this vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the checks for valid guest_irq and irq_rt->nr_rt_entries are properly implemented and maintained.  ```bash

CVE Description:
The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.13.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (assertion failure, and hypervisor hang or crash) via an out-of bounds guest_irq value, related to arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c and virt/kvm/eventfd.c.

Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	int y = 0;
	if (x > 10) {
