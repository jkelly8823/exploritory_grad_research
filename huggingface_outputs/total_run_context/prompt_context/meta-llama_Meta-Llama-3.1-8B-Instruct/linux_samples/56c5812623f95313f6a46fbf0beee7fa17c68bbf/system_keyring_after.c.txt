 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx) protection mechanism. The code checks if the PKCS#7 platform key is on the revocation list and if it is not available, it prints a message and jumps to the error label. This is a normal behavior and does not indicate any vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx) protection mechanism.  The code is following the proper checks and handling the cases as expected.  The code is secure and does not need any changes.
