 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This is evident in the uefi_blacklist_hash function where it calls uefi_blacklist_hash with a hardcoded string "bin:" without any validation or checks. This allows an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot protection mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input string "bin:" to ensure it is a valid and expected input.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure the Secure Boot protection mechanism is enforced correctly.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism.
