 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx) protection mechanism. The code checks if the PKCS#7 platform keyring is not available, but it does not check if the signature is in the dbx. This allows an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot protection mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the signature is in the dbx before validating the trust.
2. Use the `is_blacklisted` function to check if the signature is in the dbx.
3. Update the code to properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx) protection mechanism.
