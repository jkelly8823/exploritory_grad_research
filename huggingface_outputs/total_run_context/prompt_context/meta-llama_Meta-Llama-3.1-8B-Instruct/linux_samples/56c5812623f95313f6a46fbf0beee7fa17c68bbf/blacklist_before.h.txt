 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly implements the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx) protection mechanism. It only includes a declaration for the blacklist_hashes array, which is an external variable. The actual implementation of the dbx protection mechanism is located in certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c, which are not provided in the given code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet itself does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the dbx protection mechanism in certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c to ensure that it is correctly enforcing the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database protection mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-26542
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 5.8.13 does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This affects certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c.

Code Sample:
#include <linux/kernel.h>

const char *blacklist_hashes[] = {"hash1", "hash2", "hash3"};
