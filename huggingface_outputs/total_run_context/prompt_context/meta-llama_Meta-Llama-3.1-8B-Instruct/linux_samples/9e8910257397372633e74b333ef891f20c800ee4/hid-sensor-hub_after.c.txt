 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted device. The mutex lock and the hid_hw_request function do not appear to be related to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the code is properly tested and validated. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2898
CVE Description:
drivers/hid/hid-sensor-hub.c in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.11, when CONFIG_HID_SENSOR_HUB is enabled, allows physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted device.  The vulnerability is due to the hid_sensor_hub_report function not properly validating the report_id parameter, which can lead to a buffer overflow when the report_id is larger than the allocated buffer size. 
Code Sample:

	int hid_sensor_hub_report(struct hid_device *hdev, u16 report
