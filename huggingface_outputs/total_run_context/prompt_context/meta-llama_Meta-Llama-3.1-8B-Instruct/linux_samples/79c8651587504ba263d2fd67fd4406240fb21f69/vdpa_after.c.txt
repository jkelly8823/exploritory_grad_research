 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly interacts with the XFRM subsystem or parses netlink attributes. The vulnerability described in CVE-2023-3773 is related to the Linux kernel's XFRM subsystem, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-3773. However, it is always a good practice to follow secure coding guidelines and best practices to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-3773
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to cause a 4 byte out-of-bounds read of XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH when parsing netlink attributes, leading to potential leakage of sensitive heap data to userspace.  Code Sample: 
static int __init vdpa_init(void)
{
	struct vdpa_device *vdpa_dev;
	struct vdpa_net_device *vdpa_net_dev;
