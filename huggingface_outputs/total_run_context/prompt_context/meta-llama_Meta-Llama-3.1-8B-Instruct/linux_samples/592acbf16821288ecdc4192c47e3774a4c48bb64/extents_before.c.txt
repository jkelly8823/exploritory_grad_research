 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the fact that it does not zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block. This allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block before returning it to the user.
2. Use a secure memory allocation function to ensure that the memory is properly initialized.
3. Consider using a memory sanitizer to detect any potential memory leaks or uninitialized data.  ```bash
