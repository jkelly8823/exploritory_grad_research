 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 28, 42
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the fact that it does not properly zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block. This allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the unused memory region in the extent tree block is properly zeroed out before writing it to disk. This can be achieved by modifying the memset function calls to zero out the entire block, rather than just the unused area.
2. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure memset function or a secure memory allocation function, to ensure that sensitive data is properly cleared from memory. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all sensitive data is properly cleared from memory before it is written to disk. This includes not only the extent tree block, but also any other data structures that may contain sensitive information.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
