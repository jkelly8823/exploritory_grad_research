 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The variable 'fe_tuner_ops' is not checked for null before calling its methods. If 'fe_tuner_ops' is null, the program will crash when trying to access its methods.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check 'fe_tuner_ops' for null before calling its methods.
2. Initialize 'fe_tuner_ops' before using it. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

		return;
	if (fe_tuner_ops->get_status) {
		u32 tuner_status;

		fe_tuner_ops->get_status(&t->fe, &tuner_status);
		if (tuner_status & TUNER_STATUS_LOCKED)
			pr_info("Tuner is locked.\n");
	if (vt->type == t->mode) {
		vt->rxsubchans = V4L2_TUNER_SUB_MONO | V
