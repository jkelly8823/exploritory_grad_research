 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-6368. This vulnerability allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash) via a VAPIC synchronization operation involving a page-end address. The vulnerability is present in the kvm_lapic_set_vapic_addr function where it does not check if the vapic_addr is a page-end address before setting it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the vapic_addr is not a page-end address before setting it in the kvm_lapic_set_vapic_addr function.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle page-end addresses, such as using a separate data structure to track page-end addresses and checking against this data structure before setting the vapic_addr.
