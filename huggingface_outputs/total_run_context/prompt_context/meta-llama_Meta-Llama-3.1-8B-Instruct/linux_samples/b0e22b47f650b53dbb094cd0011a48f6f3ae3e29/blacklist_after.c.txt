 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-26541 because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This is evident in the `add_key_to_revocation_list` function where a key is created or updated with the `KEY_ALLOC_NOT_IN_QUOTA | KEY_ALLOC_BUILT_IN` flags, which allows the key to be created without proper validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `KEY_ALLOC_NOT_IN_QUOTA | KEY_ALLOC_BUILT_IN` flags from the `add_key_to_revocation_list` function to ensure proper validation of the key.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the key is properly validated before adding it to the blacklist keyring. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and manage the revocation certificates, such as using a secure storage mechanism like a Hardware Security Module (HSM).  VULNERABILITY LIST:
