 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This is evident from the line where the restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted macro is defined, which is a potential entry point for an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism is properly enforced by verifying the integrity of the kernel's signature.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the kernel's signature database.
3. Regularly update and patch the kernel to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed.
