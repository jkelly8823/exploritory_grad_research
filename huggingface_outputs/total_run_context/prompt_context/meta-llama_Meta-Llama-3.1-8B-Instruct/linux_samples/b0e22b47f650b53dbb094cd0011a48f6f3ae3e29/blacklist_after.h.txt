 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it includes the necessary header files and declares the extern variable blacklist_hashes, which is used in the affected kernel modules (certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c). Although the code itself does not contain any vulnerable code, its inclusion of the necessary headers and declaration of the extern variable makes it susceptible to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the unnecessary header files (crypto/pkcs7.h) that are not used in the code.
2. Avoid declaring extern variables that are not necessary for the current code segment.
3. Consider using a secure boot mechanism to prevent the execution of malicious code.
