 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. The lines 14-15 are vulnerable because they do not check if the PKCS#7 platform key is on the revocation list before validating its trust.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the PKCS#7 platform key is not on the revocation list before validating its trust. This can be done by calling the `is_key_on_revocation_list` function before calling `pkcs7_validate_trust`.
2. Update the code to properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the PKCS#7 platform key is not on the dbx list before validating its trust. This can be done by calling the `is_key_on_dbx_list` function before calling `pkcs7_validate_trust`.
