 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. This is evident in the uefi_blacklist_hash function where it does not check if the signature is in the dbx before allowing it to be added to the blacklist.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the signature is not in the dbx before adding it to the blacklist.
2. Implement the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism to prevent unauthorized signatures from being added to the blacklist. 
3. Review and update the code to ensure that it complies with the latest security guidelines and best practices.  ```
