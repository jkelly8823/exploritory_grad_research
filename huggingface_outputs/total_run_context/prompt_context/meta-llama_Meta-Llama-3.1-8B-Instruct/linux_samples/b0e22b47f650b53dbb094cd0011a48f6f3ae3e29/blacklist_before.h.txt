 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it includes the linux/kernel.h header file which is affected by the vulnerability. The extern const char __initconst *const blacklist_hashes[] declaration is also affected as it is used in the certs/blacklist.c file which is also affected by the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the inclusion of the linux/kernel.h header file.
2. Replace the extern const char __initconst *const blacklist_hashes[] declaration with a secure alternative. 
3. Review and update the certs/blacklist.c and certs/system_keyring.c files to properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database protection mechanism. 4. Update the kernel version to 5.8.14 or later to ensure the vulnerability is patched. 5. Rebuild and retest the kernel to ensure the vulnerability is fully addressed. 6. Consider using a secure boot mechanism such as UEFI Secure Boot to further mitigate the vulnerability. 7. Regularly review and update the kernel to ensure it remains secure. 8. Consider using a kernel hardening tool to further secure the kernel. 9. Consider using a secure
