 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. The code checks for the presence of a valid ASN.1 SEQUENCE tag (0x30, 0x82) but does not verify if the certificate is present in the dbx. This allows an attacker to load a malicious certificate into the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to verify if the certificate is present in the dbx before loading it into the system.
2. Use a secure method to load the certificates, such as using a trusted keyring.
3. Consider using a more secure certificate format, such as a TPM-based certificate.
