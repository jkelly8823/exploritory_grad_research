 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability. This is because the uefi_blacklist_hash function is called without proper validation of the source and data parameters, which can lead to a potential buffer overflow attack. The function is also called with a hardcoded string "bin:", which may not be properly sanitized, potentially leading to a format string vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the source and data parameters of the uefi_blacklist_hash function to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
2. Sanitize the hardcoded string "bin:" to prevent format string vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve the forbidden signature database, such as using a secure hash function and storing the hash in a secure location.
