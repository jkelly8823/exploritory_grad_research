 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26541 vulnerability because it does not properly enforce the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism. The description of the hash is kept in the description, which is a type prefix, a colon and then an even number of hex digits. This is a characteristic of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the description of the hash is not kept in the description.
2. Implement proper enforcement of the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (aka dbx) protection mechanism.
3. Review and update the code to ensure it complies with the latest security standards.  ```bash
