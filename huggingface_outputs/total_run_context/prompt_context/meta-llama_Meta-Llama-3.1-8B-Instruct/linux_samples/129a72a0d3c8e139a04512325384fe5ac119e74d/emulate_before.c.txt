 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the lack of proper synchronization between the fx_state and fxregs_state structures. The fx_state structure is being accessed and modified in multiple threads without proper locking, which can lead to a use-after-free bug when the fx_state structure is freed before it is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper synchronization between the fx_state and fxregs_state structures using locks or other synchronization primitives.
2.  Ensure that the fx_state structure is not freed until all threads have finished accessing it.
3.  Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a shared memory region, to store the fx_state structure and avoid the use-after-free bug.

CVE_ID:CVE-2017-2584
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted application that leverages instruction emulation for fxrstor, fxsave, sgdt, and sidt.
