 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free error due to the key_put(keyring) call before the goto error2 label. This is because the keyring pointer is still being used after it has been freed. The integer overflow vulnerability is not present in this code snippet, but the use-after-free vulnerability is.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the key_put(keyring) call after the goto error2 label to prevent the use-after-free error.
2. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism to prevent similar issues in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-0728
CVE Description:
The join_session_keyring function in security/keys/process_keys.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.1 mishandles object references in a certain error case, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (integer overflow and use-after-free) via crafted keyctl commands.  The integer overflow vulnerability is not present in this code snippet, but the use-after-free vulnerability is.  The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free error due to the key_put(keyring) call before
