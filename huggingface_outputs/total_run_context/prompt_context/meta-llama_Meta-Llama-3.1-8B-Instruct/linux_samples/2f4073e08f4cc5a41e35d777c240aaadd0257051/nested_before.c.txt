 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-5307 because it does not properly handle the #AC (Alignment Check) exceptions. The svm.c and vmx.c files in the Linux kernel and Xen 4.3.x through 4.6.x are affected by this vulnerability. The code does not check for the #AC exceptions and allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) by triggering many #AC exceptions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for the #AC exceptions and handle them properly.
2. Update the svm.c and vmx.c files to fix the vulnerability.
3. Implement a mechanism to prevent guest OS users from triggering many #AC exceptions.
