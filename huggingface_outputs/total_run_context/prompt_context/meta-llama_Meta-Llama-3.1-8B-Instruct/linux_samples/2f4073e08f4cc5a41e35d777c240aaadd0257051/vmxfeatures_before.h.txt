 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2015-5307. This vulnerability is related to the svm.c and vmx.c files in the Linux kernel, which allow guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) by triggering many #AC (aka Alignment Check) exceptions. The code sample defines several VMX features, including TPAUSE, UMONITOR, UMWAIT, and VM-Exit on ENCLV, which can be used to trigger the vulnerability. The specific lines of code that are vulnerable are lines 3-5, which define the VMX_FEATURE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE, VMX_FEATURE_ENCLV_EXITING, and VMX_FEATURE_BUS_LOCK_DETECTION features.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to remove or disable the VMX features that are related to the vulnerability. This can be done by commenting out or removing the lines of code that define these features. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities related to the svm.c and vmx.c files. It is also recommended to apply the latest security
