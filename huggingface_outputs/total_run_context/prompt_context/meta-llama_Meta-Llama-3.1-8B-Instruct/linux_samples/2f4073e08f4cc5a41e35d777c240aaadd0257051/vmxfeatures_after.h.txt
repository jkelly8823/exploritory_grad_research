 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2015-5307 due to the lack of proper handling of #AC (Alignment Check) exceptions. The code defines various VMX features, but it does not include any checks or mitigations for #AC exceptions, which can be triggered by guest OS users to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add checks for #AC exceptions in the svm.c and vmx.c files to prevent guest OS users from triggering multiple exceptions.
2. Implement proper handling for #AC exceptions, such as logging or terminating the guest OS, to prevent denial of service attacks.
3. Review and update the code to ensure that it complies with the latest security guidelines and best practices for handling #AC exceptions.  ```bash
