 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) due to the lack of proper handling of #AC (Alignment Check) exceptions. The code does not properly check for alignment issues, which can lead to a crash or hang of the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper alignment checking for the svm.c and vmx.c modules.
2. Add error handling for #AC exceptions to prevent crashes or hangs.
3. Consider using a more robust exception handling mechanism to prevent similar issues in the future.
