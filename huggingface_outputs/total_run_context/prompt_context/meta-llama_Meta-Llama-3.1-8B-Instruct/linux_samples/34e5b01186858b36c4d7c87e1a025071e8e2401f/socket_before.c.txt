 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition in the Linux kernel SCTP sockets. The vulnerability is present in the sctp_do_bind function where the addr_wq_lock is not held when calling sctp_destroy_sock. This can be exploited by an attacker with network service privileges to escalate to root or from the context of an unprivileged user directly if a BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is attached which denies creation of some SCTP socket.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Hold the addr_wq_lock when calling sctp_destroy_sock to prevent the race condition.
2. Use a lock to protect the auto_asconf_splist list to prevent concurrent modifications.
3. Consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex, to protect the sctp_do_bind function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-23133
CVE Description:
A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before 5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service or an unprivileged process. If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->
