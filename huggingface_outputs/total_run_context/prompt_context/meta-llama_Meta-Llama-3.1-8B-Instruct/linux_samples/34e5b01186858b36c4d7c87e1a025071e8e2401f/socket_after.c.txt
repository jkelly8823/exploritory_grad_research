 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets. The sctp_destroy_sock function is called without proper locking, which can lead to an element being removed from the auto_asconf_splist list without any proper locking. This can be exploited by an attacker with network service privileges to escalate to root or from the context of an unprivileged user directly if a BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is attached which denies creation of some SCTP socket.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly lock the auto_asconf_splist list before removing an element from it.
2. Use a lock-free data structure to avoid the need for locking.
3. Implement a mechanism to prevent the sctp_destroy_sock function from being called without proper locking.

CVE_ID:CVE-2021-23133
CVE Description:
A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c) before 5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the context of a network service or an unprivileged process. If sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr
