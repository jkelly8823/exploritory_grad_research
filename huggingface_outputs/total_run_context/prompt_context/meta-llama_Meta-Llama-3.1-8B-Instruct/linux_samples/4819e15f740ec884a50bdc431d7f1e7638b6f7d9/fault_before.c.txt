 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain the init_new_context function, which is the function that is vulnerable to the use-after-free bug. The code snippet appears to be related to handling hardware faults and TLB invalidations, and does not seem to be related to the init_new_context function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain the vulnerable function, so no fixes are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the code that calls the init_new_context function to ensure that it is handling errors correctly. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-17053
CVE Description:
The init_new_context function in arch/x86/include/asm/mmu_context.h in the Linux kernel before 4.12.10 does not correctly handle errors from LDT table allocation when forking a new process, allowing a local attacker to achieve a use-after-free or possibly have unspecified other impact by running a specially crafted program. This vulnerability only affected kernels built with CONFIG_MODIFY_LDT_SYSCALL=y.  Code Sample: 
void init_new_context(struct
