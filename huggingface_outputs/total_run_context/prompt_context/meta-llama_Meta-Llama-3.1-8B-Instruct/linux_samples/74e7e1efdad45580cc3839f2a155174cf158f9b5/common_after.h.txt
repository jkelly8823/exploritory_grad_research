 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any explicit code that directly relates to the CVEs provided. However, the functions and data structures used in the code suggest that it is part of a network driver, which is the context in which the CVEs are applicable. The lack of explicit code related to the CVEs does not necessarily mean that the code is not vulnerable, as the vulnerability could be introduced through external dependencies or interactions with other components. Therefore, it is recommended to review the code's dependencies and interactions with other components to ensure that it does not inadvertently introduce the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code's dependencies and interactions with other components to ensure that they do not introduce the vulnerability.
2. Consider adding checks and mitigations to prevent the deadlock scenario described in the CVEs.
3. Ensure that the code is properly tested to ensure that it does not introduce the vulnerability.
