 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to deadlock in the Linux netback driver. This is due to the fact that the SKB of a packet is being freed while the netpoll is active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to. This is a known issue and has been reported as CVE-2022-42329.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if netpoll is active for the interface before freeing the SKB of a packet.
2. Use a lock to protect the SKB from being freed while netpoll is active.
3. Consider using a different approach to handle packet drops that does not involve freeing the SKB while netpoll is active.
