 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-24588 vulnerability because it does not properly authenticate the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field.
2. Ensure that the code properly handles non-SSP A-MSDU frames.
3. Update the code to use SSP A-MSDUs instead of non-SSP A-MSDUs. 
4. Implement proper authentication for the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field. 
5. Review the code to ensure that it is compliant with the 802.11 standard. 
6. Consider using a more secure encryption method, such as WPA3. 
7. Update the code to properly handle A-MSDU frames on pre-HT connections. 
8. Ensure that the code properly handles A-MSDU frames on HT connections. 
9. Review the code to ensure that it is free from any other vulnerabilities. 
10. Consider using a code review tool to
