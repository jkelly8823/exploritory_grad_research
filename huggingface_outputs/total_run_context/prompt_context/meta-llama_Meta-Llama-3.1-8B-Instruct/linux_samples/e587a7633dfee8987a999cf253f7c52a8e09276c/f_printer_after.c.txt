 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 11-15, 21-25, 31-35, 41-45, 51-55, 61-65, 71-75, 81-85, 91-95
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the improper handling of the usb_ep_queue function call. The function is not properly called, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service or have unspecified other impact. This vulnerability is present in multiple lines of code where the function call is not properly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly call the usb_ep_queue function to prevent denial of service attacks.
2. Review the code to ensure that all function calls are properly handled to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handling function calls, such as using a try-catch block to catch and handle any errors that may occur.
