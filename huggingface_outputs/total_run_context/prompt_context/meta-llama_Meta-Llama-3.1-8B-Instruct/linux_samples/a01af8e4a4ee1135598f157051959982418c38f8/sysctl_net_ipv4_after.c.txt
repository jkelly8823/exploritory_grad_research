 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the range array. This is similar to the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-3848. The range array is not checked for its size before being used, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the range array is larger than expected.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add bounds checking on the range array to prevent buffer overflows.
- Use a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the range values.
- Consider using a more secure way to store and retrieve the range values, such as using a separate data structure or a secure storage mechanism.
