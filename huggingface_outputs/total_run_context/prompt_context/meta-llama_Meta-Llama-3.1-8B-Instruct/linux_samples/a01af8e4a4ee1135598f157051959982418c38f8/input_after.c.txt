VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2010-3848
CVE Description:
Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet_sendmsg function in net/econet/af_econet.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2, when an econet address is configured, allows local users to gain privileges by providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE_ID:CVE-2010-3850
CVE Description:
The ec_dev_ioctl function in net/econet/af_econet.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE_ID:CVE-2010-3849
CVE Description:
The econet_sendmsg
