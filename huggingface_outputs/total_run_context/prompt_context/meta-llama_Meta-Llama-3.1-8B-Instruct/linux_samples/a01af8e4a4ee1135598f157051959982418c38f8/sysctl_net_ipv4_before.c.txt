 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the range array. This is similar to the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-3848.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add bounds checking to the range array to prevent buffer overflow.
- Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the port range values.
- Ensure that the sysctl_tcp_adv_win_scale and sysctl_tcp_tw_reuse variables are properly initialized before accessing them. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- None

VULNERABLE: YES
