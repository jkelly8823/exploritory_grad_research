 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2022-23040. The xenbus driver does not check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. This allows the backend to keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the grant reference is successfully removed before freeing the related data page.
2. Synchronize the freeing of the related data page with dropping the granted access.

CVE Description:
Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant
