 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5736 because it does not properly handle file-descriptor mishandling related to /proc/self/exe. The code allows an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within a container. This occurs because the code does not ensure that the old executable file is properly denied write access before allowing the new executable file to be set.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the old executable file is properly denied write access before allowing the new executable file to be set.
2. Use a more secure method to handle file-descriptor mishandling related to /proc/self/exe.
3. Consider using a different approach to manage executable files in containers.
