 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5736 because it does not properly handle file descriptors when executing a command as root within a container. The `allow_write_access` function is called before the `fput` function, which can lead to a file descriptor leak. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary and obtain host root access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call `fput` before `allow_write_access` to ensure that the file descriptor is properly closed.
2. Use `fput` with the `interpreter` pointer to ensure that the file descriptor is properly closed, even if an error occurs.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle file descriptors, such as using a `fdopen` function to create a file descriptor from a file pointer.
