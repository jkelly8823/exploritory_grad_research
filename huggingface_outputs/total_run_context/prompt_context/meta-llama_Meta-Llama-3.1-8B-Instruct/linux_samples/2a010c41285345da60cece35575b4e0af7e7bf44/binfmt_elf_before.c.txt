VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability. This is because the code is not properly handling file descriptors, specifically in the lines where it is freeing the interpreter and ELF data structures. The code is freeing the `interp_elf_ex` and `interp_elf_phdata` structures twice, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary and obtain host root access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate frees of `interp_elf_ex` and `interp_elf_phdata`.
2. Ensure that the `allow_write_access` function is called before freeing the interpreter and ELF data structures.
3. Consider using a more robust memory management approach to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```c
