 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability. The code does not involve the use of the runc binary or any similar functionality that would allow an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary. The code is focused on opening and cloning files for interpretation, which does not seem to be related to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure its security and functionality. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5736
CVE Description:
runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access,
