 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability. The code does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary. The code does handle file descriptors properly and does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to execute a command as root within a container.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it is secure. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5736
CVE Description:
runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with
