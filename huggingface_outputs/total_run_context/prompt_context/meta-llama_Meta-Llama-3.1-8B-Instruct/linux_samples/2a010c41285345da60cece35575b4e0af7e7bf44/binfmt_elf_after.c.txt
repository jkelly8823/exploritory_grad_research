 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability. This is because the code is not properly handling the file descriptors, specifically the /proc/self/exe file descriptor, which can be used to overwrite the host runc binary. The code is freeing the interpreter file descriptor twice, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate kfree(interp_elf_ex) call on line 7.
2. Ensure that the file descriptors are properly handled and closed before freeing the interpreter and elf_phdata. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the interpreter and elf_phdata, such as using a secure memory allocator.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5736
CVE Description:
runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image,
