 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5736 because it does not properly handle file descriptors when opening an executable file. In the `open_exec` function, the `deny_write_access` function is called, but the `allow_write_access` function is not called in the `do_close_execat` function. This allows an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within a container.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call `allow_write_access` in the `do_close_execat` function to ensure that the file descriptor is properly closed.
2. Review the code to ensure that all file descriptors are properly handled and closed to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

CVE Description:
runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with
