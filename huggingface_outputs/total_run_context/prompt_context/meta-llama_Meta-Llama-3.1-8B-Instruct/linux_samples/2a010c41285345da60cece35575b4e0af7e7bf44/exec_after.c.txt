 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5736 because it does not properly handle the file descriptor of the executable file. In the do_close_execat function, the file descriptor of the executable file is not properly closed, which can lead to a file descriptor leak. This can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite the host runc binary and obtain host root access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly close the file descriptor of the executable file in the do_close_execat function.
2. Use the fput function to close the file descriptor of the executable file.
3. Check the return value of the fput function to ensure that the file descriptor is properly closed. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to CVE-2019-5736 because it does not contain any code that can be exploited to overwrite the host runc binary. The code only contains functions for opening and closing executable files, and does not contain any code that can be used to execute a command as root within a container.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
