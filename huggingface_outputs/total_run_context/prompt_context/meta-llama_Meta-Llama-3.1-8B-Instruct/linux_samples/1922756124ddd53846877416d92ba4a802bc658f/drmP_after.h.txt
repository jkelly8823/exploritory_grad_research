 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any direct references to the drm_modeset_ctl function or any similar function that could potentially be vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1013. However, the presence of the num_crtcs variable suggests that the code may be related to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem, which is mentioned in the CVE description. Further analysis would be required to determine if the code is actually vulnerable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code to ensure that it is not using any vulnerable functions or structures.
- Consider using a static code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- If the code is indeed related to the DRM subsystem, consider applying the relevant patches to fix any potential vulnerabilities.  ```bash
