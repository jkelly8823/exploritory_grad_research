 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1013 vulnerability because it does not properly validate the num_crtcs structure member in the ioctl argument. This allows an attacker to trigger out-of-bounds write operations, leading to a denial of service or other unspecified impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the num_crtcs structure member in the ioctl argument to ensure it is within the valid range.
2. Use a safer data type, such as unsigned int, to store the num_crtcs value to prevent signedness errors.
3. Consider using a bounds checking mechanism to prevent out-of-bounds write operations. 
4. Update the kernel to version 2.6.38 or later to fix the vulnerability. 
5. In OpenBSD, update the kernel to version 4.9 or later to fix the vulnerability.  ```bash
