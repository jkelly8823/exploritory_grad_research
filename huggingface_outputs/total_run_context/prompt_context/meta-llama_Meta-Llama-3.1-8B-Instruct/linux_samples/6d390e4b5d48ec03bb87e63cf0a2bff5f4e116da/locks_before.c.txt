 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-19769. The vulnerability is related to a use-after-free (read) in the perf_trace_lock_acquire function, which is not present in the given code sample. The code sample uses a spin lock to protect access to the blocked_lock_lock and fl_blocked_requests, which prevents the use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is secure and does not contain the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the spin lock is properly released in all cases.
