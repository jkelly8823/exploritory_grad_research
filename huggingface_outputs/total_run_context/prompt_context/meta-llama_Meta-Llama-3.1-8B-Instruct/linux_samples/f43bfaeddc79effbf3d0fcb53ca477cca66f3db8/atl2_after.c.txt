 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that matches the description of the vulnerability. The atl2_probe function is not present in this code snippet, and the code does not enable scatter/gather I/O. The atl2_phy_init function is called, but it is not related to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that the atl2_phy_init function is called correctly to avoid any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-2117
CVE Description:
The atl2_probe function in drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/atlx/atl2.c in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by reading packet data.  Code Sample: 
err = -EIO;

netdev->hw_features = NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_RX;
netdev->features |= (NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_TX | NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_C
