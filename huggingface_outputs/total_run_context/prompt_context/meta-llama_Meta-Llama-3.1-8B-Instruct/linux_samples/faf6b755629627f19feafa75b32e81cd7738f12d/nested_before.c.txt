 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3653 and CVE-2021-3656 due to improper validation of the "int_ctl" and "virt_ext" fields. The code does not properly check the "int_ctl" field for the "int_ctl_vmcb12_bits" and "int_ctl_vmcb01_bits" flags, which could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support or disable VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS for the L2 guest. This could result in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper validation for the "int_ctl" field to ensure that the "int_ctl_vmcb12_bits" and "int_ctl_vmcb01_bits" flags are not set.
2. Add proper validation for the "virt_ext" field to ensure that it is not set to disable VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS.
3. Use a secure method to copy the "nested.ctl" fields to the "vmcb" structure, such as using a secure copy function or by initializing the "vmcb"
