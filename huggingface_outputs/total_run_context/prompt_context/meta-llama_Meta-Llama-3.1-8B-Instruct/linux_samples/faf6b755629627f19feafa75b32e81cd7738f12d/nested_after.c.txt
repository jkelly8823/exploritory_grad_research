 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3653 and CVE-2021-3656 due to the improper validation of the "int_ctl" field. The code is using a bitwise OR operation to combine the values of svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl and svm->vmcb01.ptr->control.int_ctl, which can lead to a malicious L1 guest to enable AVIC support or disable VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS for the L2 guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "int_ctl" field properly before using it.
2. Use a secure method to combine the values of svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl and svm->vmcb01.ptr->control.int_ctl.
3. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the values that can be set for the "int_ctl" field. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3653
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a
