 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5753 due to the use of speculative execution and branch prediction. The function kvm_arch_vm_ioctl() contains a switch statement that can be vulnerable to branch prediction attacks. The switch statement can be used to predict the branch and execute the code before the actual branch is taken, potentially leaking sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a compiler that supports Spectre mitigation, such as GCC 8.1 or later.
2. Use the __spectre_writable() function to check if the memory is writable before executing the code.
3. Use the __spectre_load() function to load the data from memory in a way that prevents speculative execution.
4. Consider using a different data structure, such as a jump table, to reduce the predictability of the branch. 
5. Use a compiler flag, such as -mindirect-branch, to prevent indirect branches. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5754 because it does not contain any indirect
