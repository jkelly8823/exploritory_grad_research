 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753) due to the use of indirect branch prediction in the ioctl function calls. The code uses a macro to define the ioctl function calls, which can lead to indirect branch prediction. This can allow an attacker with local user access to disclose information via a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a compiler that supports Spectre mitigation, such as GCC 8.1 or later.
2. Use the `__spectre_v1__` attribute to mark the functions that are vulnerable to Spectre variant 1.
3. Use a static analysis tool to identify and fix indirect branch predictions in the code.
4. Consider using a different approach to define the ioctl function calls, such as using a switch statement or a lookup table.
