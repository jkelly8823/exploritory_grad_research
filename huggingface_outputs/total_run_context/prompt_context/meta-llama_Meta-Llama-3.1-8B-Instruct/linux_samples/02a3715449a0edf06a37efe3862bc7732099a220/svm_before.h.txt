 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly relates to the CVEs provided. The code appears to be related to defining constants for virtualization settings, but it does not include any code that would allow a malicious L1 guest to disable VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts, VLS, or enable AVIC support for a nested guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire system to ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the code up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.  ```python
```python
def analyze_code(code):
    # Define the constants for virtualization settings
    V_IGN_TPR_SHIFT = 20
    V_IGN_TPR_MASK = (1 << V_IGN_TPR_SHIFT)

    V_INTR_MASKING_SHIFT = 24
    V_INTR_MASKING_MASK = (1 << V_INTR_MASKING_SHIFT)

    V_GIF_ENABLE_SHIFT = 25
