 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3656. The issue is due to improper validation of the "virt_ext" field in the svm->vmcb->control structure. This allows a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "virt_ext" field properly before assigning it to svm->vmcb->control.virt_ext.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed values for "virt_ext".
3. Implement additional checks to ensure that the L2 guest does not have access to physical pages of the host. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-3653. The issue described in this CVE is related to improper validation of the "int_ctl" field, which is not present in this code snippet.
