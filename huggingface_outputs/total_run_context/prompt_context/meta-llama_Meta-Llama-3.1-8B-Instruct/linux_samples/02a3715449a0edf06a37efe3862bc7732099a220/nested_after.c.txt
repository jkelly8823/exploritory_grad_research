 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3656. The issue arises from the improper validation of the "virt_ext" field in the svm->vmcb->control structure. This allows a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "virt_ext" field properly before setting it in the svm->vmcb->control structure.
2. Consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed values for the "virt_ext" field.
3. Ensure that the "virt_ext" field is properly sanitized before being used in the svm->vmcb->control structure.
