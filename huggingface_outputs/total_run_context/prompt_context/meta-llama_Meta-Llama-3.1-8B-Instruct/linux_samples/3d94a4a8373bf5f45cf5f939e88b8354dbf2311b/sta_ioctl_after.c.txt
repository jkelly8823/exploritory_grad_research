 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking in the memcpy function. The country_ie_len variable is not checked to ensure it does not exceed the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the memcpy function to ensure that the country_ie_len variable does not exceed the size of the destination buffer.
2. Use the strlcpy function instead of memcpy to copy the country information, as it provides bounds checking.
3. Consider using a safer function like strscpy to copy the country information, as it provides additional safety features. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-14895
CVE Description:
A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux kernel, all versions 3.x.x and 4.x.x before 4.18.0, in Marvell WiFi chip driver. The flaw could occur when the station attempts a connection negotiation during the handling of the remote devices country settings. This could allow the remote device to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  CVE_ID
