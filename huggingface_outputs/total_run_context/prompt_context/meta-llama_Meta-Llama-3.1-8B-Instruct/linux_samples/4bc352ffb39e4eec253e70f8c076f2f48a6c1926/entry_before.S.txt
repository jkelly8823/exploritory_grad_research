 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5715 vulnerability due to the presence of a speculative execution vulnerability in the SMC64 instruction. The SMC64 instruction is used to call the Silicon provider service, which may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the SMC64 instruction with a non-speculative execution instruction, such as a branch instruction.
2. Implement a Spectre mitigation technique, such as reordering the instructions or using a branch predictor bypass.
3. Use a secure SMC64 instruction, such as the one provided by the ARMv8.2 architecture. 
4. Disable speculative execution in the system or use a secure mode of operation. 
5. Use a secure compiler flag to prevent the generation of speculative code. 
6. Implement a memory protection mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. 
7. Regularly update the system and its components to ensure that the latest security patches are applied. 
8. Use a secure programming practice, such as using a secure coding standard and code review. 
9. Implement a secure boot
