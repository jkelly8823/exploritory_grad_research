 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-5715 due to the presence of speculative execution and indirect branch prediction. The vulnerability is related to the use of the `arm_smccc_1_1_hvc` function, which is a known vulnerable function. The code also uses the `asm volatile` directive, which can lead to speculative execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `arm_smccc_1_1_hvc` function with a secure alternative.
2. Remove the `asm volatile` directive and use a safer alternative.
3. Implement a Spectre mitigation technique, such as retpoline or IBRS, to prevent speculative execution.
