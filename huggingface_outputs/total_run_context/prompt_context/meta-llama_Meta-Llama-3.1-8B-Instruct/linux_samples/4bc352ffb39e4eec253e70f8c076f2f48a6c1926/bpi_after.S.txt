VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5715 vulnerability, which is a Spectre variant 1 vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the CPU uses speculative execution to predict the branch of an indirect branch instruction. In this code sample, the `smccc_workaround_1` macro uses indirect branch prediction by storing the return address on the stack and then jumping to it. This allows an attacker to potentially predict the branch and access sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a different method for indirect branch prediction, such as using a direct branch instruction or a branch target predictor. Additionally, the code should be compiled with the `-mindirect-branch=thunk` flag to prevent indirect branch prediction. The modified code should look like this:
```assembly
.macro smccc_workaround_1 inst
	sub	sp, sp, #(8 * 4)
	stp	x2, x3, [sp, #(8 * 0)]
	stp	x0, x1, [sp, #(8 * 2)]

	// Add the following lines to prevent indirect branch prediction
