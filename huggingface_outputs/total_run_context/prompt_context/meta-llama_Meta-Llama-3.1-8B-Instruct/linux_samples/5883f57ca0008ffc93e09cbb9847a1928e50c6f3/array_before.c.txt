 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5,6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-0726 vulnerability because it does not perform an expected uid check. The lines 5 and 6 are vulnerable because they directly access the mm->start_code and mm->end_code fields without checking the uid of the process. This allows a local user to read the start_code and end_code fields in the /proc/#####/stat file for a process executing a PIE binary, which can be used to defeat the ASLR protection mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a uid check before accessing the mm->start_code and mm->end_code fields.
2. Use the get_task_stat function instead of directly accessing the mm->start_code and mm->end_code fields.
3. Consider using a more secure way to retrieve the start_code and end_code fields, such as using the /proc/self/maps file.  ```bash
