 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-0726 vulnerability because it does not perform an expected uid check. This allows local users to read the start_code and end_code fields in the /proc/#####/stat file for a process executing a PIE binary, which can be used to defeat the ASLR protection mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add a uid check to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the start_code and end_code fields.
- Consider using a more secure method to retrieve the memory information, such as using the /proc/self/maps file instead of the /proc/#####/stat file. 
- Update the code to use the latest version of the Linux kernel, which includes the fix for this vulnerability.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1002101
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.13.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the net/sched tree data structure, where a freed tree node is still referenced by the root node, leading to a use-after-free error when the root node is accessed.

Code Sample:
