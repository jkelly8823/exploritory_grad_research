 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2018-3615) due to the use of speculative execution in the cpu_show_spec_store_bypass function. This function is not properly mitigated against speculative execution attacks, allowing an attacker with local user access to potentially disclose information residing in the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Apply the Spectre variant 1 mitigation patches to the cpu_show_spec_store_bypass function.
2. Use a compiler that supports the -mindirect-branch=thunk function to mitigate speculative execution attacks.
3. Consider using a hardware-based mitigation such as Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to protect against speculative execution attacks. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to the L1TF (CVE-2018-3620) or L1D (CVE-2018-3646) vulnerabilities. The cpu_show_l1tf function is not vulnerable to these attacks as it does not use speculative execution or address translations in a way that would allow an attacker to disclose information residing in the L
