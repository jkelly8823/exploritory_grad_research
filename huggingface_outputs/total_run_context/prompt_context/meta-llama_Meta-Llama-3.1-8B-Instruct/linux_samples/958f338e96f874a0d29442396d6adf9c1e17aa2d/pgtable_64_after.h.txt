 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a side-channel analysis attack due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. The vulnerability is related to the way the offset is inverted by a binary not operation to make the high physical bits set. This can allow an attacker with local user access to disclose information residing in the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using speculative execution and address translations.
2. Use a different method to invert the offset, such as using a bitwise NOT operator.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a secure memory allocation function.
4. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities related to side-channel analysis attacks.
