 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620. The vulnerability is due to the use of speculative execution and address translations, which may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache to an attacker with local user access via a terminal page fault and a side-channel analysis. The code uses the `__swp_entry` macro to create a `swp_entry_t` structure, which may be vulnerable to this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to create the `swp_entry_t` structure, such as using a secure function or a secure macro.
2. Avoid using speculative execution and address translations in sensitive code paths.
3. Consider using a secure page table implementation that is resistant to side-channel attacks.
