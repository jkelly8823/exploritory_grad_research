 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample includes the necessary header files for page table isolation, which may be vulnerable to the speculative execution attacks described in CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, and CVE-2018-3646. The inclusion of these header files may indicate that the code is using speculative execution and address translations, which could potentially allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code for any potential uses of speculative execution and address translations.
2. Consider using software-based page table isolation to mitigate the vulnerability.
3. Apply the necessary patches to fix the vulnerability.
