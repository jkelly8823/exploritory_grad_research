 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially be vulnerable to the described vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a set of inline functions and macros related to memory management and remapping, but it does not utilize speculative execution or address translations in a way that could lead to unauthorized disclosure of information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up-to-date and follow best practices for secure coding.
