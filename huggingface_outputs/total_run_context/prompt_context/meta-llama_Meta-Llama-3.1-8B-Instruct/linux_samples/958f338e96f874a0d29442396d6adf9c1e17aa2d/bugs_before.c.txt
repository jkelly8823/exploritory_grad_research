 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre v2 vulnerability due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. The code is using the `ssb_select_mitigation` function, which is a mitigation for the Spectre v2 vulnerability. However, the code is not properly checking for the presence of the vulnerability before enabling the mitigation. This allows an attacker with local user access to potentially exploit the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the CPU has the Spectre v2 vulnerability before enabling the mitigation.
2. Use a more robust mitigation strategy, such as disabling speculative execution or using a hardware-based mitigation.
3. Consider using a different CPU architecture that is not vulnerable to Spectre v2. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2018-3615 vulnerability, as it does not use Intel software guard extensions (Intel SGX) and is not a microprocessor utilizing speculative execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

VULNERABLE: NO
