 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an operating system's architecture, specifically dealing with interrupt descriptor table (IDT) setup. It includes various header files for low-level system programming and defines a structure for IDT entries. However, there is no indication of speculative execution or cache-related vulnerabilities such as those described in the provided CVEs. The code seems to be focused on setting up and managing the IDT, which does not directly relate to the vulnerabilities mentioned.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. However, it is essential to note that the code's security is dependent on the overall system architecture and implementation, which may introduce other vulnerabilities. A thorough review of the entire system is recommended to ensure its security.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-3615
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and Intel software guard extensions (Intel SGX) may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from an enclave to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
