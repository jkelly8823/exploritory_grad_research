 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620. This is because the code uses a switch statement to handle different page fault reasons, but it does not properly handle the case where the page fault reason is not one of the expected values. This can lead to a terminal page fault, which can be used by an attacker to disclose information residing in the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the page fault reason is one of the expected values before handling it.
2. Use a more secure method to handle the page fault reason, such as using a lookup table or a more robust switch statement.
3. Consider using a secure page fault handler that is designed to prevent side-channel attacks.
