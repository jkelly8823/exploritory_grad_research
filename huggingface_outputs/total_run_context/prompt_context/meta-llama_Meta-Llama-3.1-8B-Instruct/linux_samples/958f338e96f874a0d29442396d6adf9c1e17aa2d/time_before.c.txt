 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that utilizes speculative execution or address translations, which are the primary concerns for the listed vulnerabilities. The code includes various Linux kernel headers, but they do not appear to be related to the vulnerabilities in question.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the listed CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to keep up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates for the Linux kernel.  The code may still be vulnerable to other types of vulnerabilities not listed here.  It is recommended to perform a thorough security audit to ensure the code is secure.  Additionally, consider using a secure coding practice such as code reviews and static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
