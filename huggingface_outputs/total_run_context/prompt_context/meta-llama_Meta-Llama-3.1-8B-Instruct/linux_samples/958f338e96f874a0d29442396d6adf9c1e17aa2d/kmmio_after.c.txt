 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620. The function clear_pte_presence() uses speculative execution to access the pte_clear() function, which may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache to an attacker with local user access via a terminal page fault and a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a non-speculative execution approach to access the pte_clear() function.
2. Consider using a lock to prevent concurrent access to the pte_clear() function.
3. Use a cache-friendly data structure to reduce the impact of the side-channel analysis.
