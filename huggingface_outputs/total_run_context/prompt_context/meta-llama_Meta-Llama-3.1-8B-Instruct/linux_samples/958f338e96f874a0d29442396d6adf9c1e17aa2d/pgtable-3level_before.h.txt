 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability (CVE-2018-3615). This is because the code uses speculative execution and does not properly mitigate the vulnerability. The use of the BUILD_BUG_ON macro in the MAX_SWAPFILES_CHECK function does not prevent the vulnerability, as it only checks if the MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT value is greater than 5, but does not prevent the speculative execution of the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a non-speculative execution path, such as using a branch predictor or a cache bypass. Additionally, the code should be modified to properly mitigate the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability, such as by using a Spectre mitigation technique such as retpoline or IBRS. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is not vulnerable to the Spectre variant 2 vulnerability (CVE-2018-3620). This is because the code does not use address translations that are vulnerable to the Spectre variant 2 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
