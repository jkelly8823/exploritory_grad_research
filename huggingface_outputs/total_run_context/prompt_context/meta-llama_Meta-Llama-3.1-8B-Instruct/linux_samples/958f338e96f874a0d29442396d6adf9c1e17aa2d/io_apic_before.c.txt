 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the vulnerabilities listed. The code includes various kernel headers but does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to speculative execution attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications to prevent the listed vulnerabilities.  The code is simply a collection of kernel header inclusions.  It does not contain any executable code that could be vulnerable to the listed CVEs.  The code is likely a header file or a placeholder for future code.
