 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code includes the linux/hyperv.h header file which may be vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646 due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. However, the actual vulnerability is not present in this code snippet as it is just an include statement. The actual vulnerability would be present in the code that uses the functions or variables declared in this header file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code that uses the functions or variables declared in the linux/hyperv.h header file to ensure that it does not contain any vulnerable code.
- Consider using a secure alternative to the functions or variables declared in the linux/hyperv.h header file if possible.
- Ensure that the code is properly audited and tested to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  ```bash
