 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a header file for x86 architecture, specifically dealing with page table management. It defines two macros, __pte_to_swp_entry and __swp_entry_to_pte, which seem to be related to converting between page table entries (pte) and swap entries (swp_entry). The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to speculative execution or cache side-channel attacks, which are the focus of the provided CVEs. The code is likely a low-level, architecture-specific implementation and does not appear to be vulnerable to the described issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be a standard implementation of page table management for x86 architecture and does not require any specific fixes. However, it is essential to note that this code is highly architecture-specific and may not be applicable or relevant to other platforms. As such, it is crucial to ensure that any modifications or updates to this code are carefully reviewed and tested to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-3615
