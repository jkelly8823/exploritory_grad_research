 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the vulnerabilities listed. The code includes various kernel headers but does not contain any code that would utilize speculative execution or address translations in a way that would be vulnerable to the described attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.  The code is simply a collection of kernel header inclusions.  Further analysis would be required to determine if the code that uses these headers contains any vulnerabilities.  However, based on the provided code sample, there are no vulnerabilities present.  Further analysis of the code that uses these headers would be required to determine if any vulnerabilities are present.
