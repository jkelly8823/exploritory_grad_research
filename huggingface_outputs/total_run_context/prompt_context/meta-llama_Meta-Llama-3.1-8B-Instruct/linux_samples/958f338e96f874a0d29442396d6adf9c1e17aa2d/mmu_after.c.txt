 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620. The line `trace_kvm_page_fault(fault_address, error_code);` is executed when the default case is encountered. This can potentially lead to a terminal page fault, which can be used by an attacker with local user access to disclose information residing in the L1 data cache via a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to handle page faults, such as using a secure page fault handler.
2. Disable speculative execution if possible.
3. Use a secure method to flush the L1 data cache, such as using the `l1tf_flush_l1d` flag. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
