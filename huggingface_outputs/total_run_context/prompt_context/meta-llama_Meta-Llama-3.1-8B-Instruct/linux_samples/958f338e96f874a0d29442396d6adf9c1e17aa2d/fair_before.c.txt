 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs. The code appears to be related to setting idle cores in a scheduling domain, and does not involve speculative execution or address translations that could be exploited by the described vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code for potential vulnerabilities, especially when working with sensitive or critical systems.  The code could be reviewed for other potential issues, such as memory leaks or buffer overflows, but based on the provided information, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs.  Further analysis may be necessary to determine if the code is vulnerable to other types of attacks.  It is also worth noting that the code is using a conditional compilation directive, which may indicate that it is only compiled under certain conditions, and may not be relevant to all systems.  Further information about the system and the code's intended use would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive analysis.  It is also worth noting that the code is using a conditional compilation directive, which
