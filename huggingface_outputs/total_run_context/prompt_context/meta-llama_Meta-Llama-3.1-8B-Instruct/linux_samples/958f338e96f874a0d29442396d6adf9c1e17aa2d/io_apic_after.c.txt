 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the vulnerabilities listed. The code includes various kernel headers but does not contain any code that would utilize speculative execution or address translations in a way that would be vulnerable to the described attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.  The code is simply a collection of kernel header inclusions.  Further code would be required to determine if any vulnerabilities exist.  It is recommended to continue reviewing the code for any potential vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to ensure that any code that is written is reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.  This includes code that utilizes speculative execution and address translations.  It is also recommended to ensure that any code that is written is reviewed for potential side-channel attacks.  This includes code that utilizes speculative execution and address translations.  It is also recommended to ensure that any code that is written is reviewed for potential terminal page faults.  This includes code that utilizes speculative execution and address translations.  It is also recommended to ensure that any code that is written is reviewed for potential guest OS privilege escalation.  This includes code that utilizes speculative
