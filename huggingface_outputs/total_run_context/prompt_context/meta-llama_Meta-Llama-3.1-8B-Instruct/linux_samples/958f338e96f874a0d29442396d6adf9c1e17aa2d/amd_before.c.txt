 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, and CVE-2018-3646 due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. The code is using the `cpuid` instruction to retrieve information about the CPU, which can be used to disclose information residing in the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure method to retrieve CPU information, such as using the `rdmsrl` instruction to read the MSR register directly.
2. Disable speculative execution and address translations if possible.
3. Use a cache-friendly algorithm to reduce the risk of side-channel attacks.
4. Implement additional security measures, such as using a secure enclave or a trusted execution environment (TEE). 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-3615
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and Intel software guard extensions (Intel SGX) may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from an enclave to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
