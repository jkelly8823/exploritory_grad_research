 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2018-3615) due to the use of speculative execution in the line `c->cpu_core_id %= cus_per_node;`. This line can potentially leak sensitive information from the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the line with a non-speculative execution approach, such as using a non-speculative modulo operation.
2. Consider using a compiler flag or a library that provides a safe and secure way to perform modulo operations.
3. If possible, consider using a different architecture or a different programming model that is not vulnerable to Spectre variant 1. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to the Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2018-3620) because it does not use address translations that can be exploited by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to the Spectre variant 3 (CVE-2018-3646)
