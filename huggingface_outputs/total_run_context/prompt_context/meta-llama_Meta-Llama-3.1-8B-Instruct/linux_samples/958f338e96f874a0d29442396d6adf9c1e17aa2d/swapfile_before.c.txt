 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620 due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. The function `read_swap_header` is accessing the `swap_header` structure without proper bounds checking, which can lead to a terminal page fault and a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking for the `swap_header` structure to prevent accessing memory outside its bounds.
2. Use a secure method to access the `swap_header` structure, such as using a secure pointer or a memory-safe function.
3. Consider using a compiler flag to disable speculative execution or use a hardware-based solution to mitigate the vulnerability.
