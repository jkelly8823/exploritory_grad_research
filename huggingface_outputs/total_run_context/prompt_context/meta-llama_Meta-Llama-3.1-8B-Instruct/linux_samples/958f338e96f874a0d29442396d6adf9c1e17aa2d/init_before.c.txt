 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability (CVE-2018-3615). This is because the code uses speculative execution to access the L1 data cache, which can be exploited by an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis. The specific lines of code that are vulnerable are lines 5 and 6, where the __cachemode2pte_tbl and __pte2cachemode_tbl arrays are accessed using speculative execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a non-speculative execution path, such as by using a cache-friendly data structure or by using a software-based cache management mechanism. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-3615
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and Intel software guard extensions (Intel SGX) may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from an enclave to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
