 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a header file for the Linux kernel's swapfile functionality. It includes function declarations and extern statements for various swap-related functions. However, there is no indication of speculative execution or address translation vulnerabilities, which are the primary concerns of the listed CVEs. The code seems to be a straightforward declaration of functions and data structures, without any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure based on the provided analysis. However, it is essential to note that this analysis is limited to the provided code snippet and may not cover potential vulnerabilities in the implementation of the functions declared in this header file. A more thorough review of the kernel's swapfile functionality is recommended.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
