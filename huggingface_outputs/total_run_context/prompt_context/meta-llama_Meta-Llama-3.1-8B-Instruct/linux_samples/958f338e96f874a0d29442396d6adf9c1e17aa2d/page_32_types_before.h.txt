 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability (CVE-2018-3646) due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. The code is using the PAE (Physical Address Extension) feature, which enables the use of 36-bit physical addresses. This allows an attacker with local user access and guest OS privilege to access the L1 data cache and potentially disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable the PAE feature to prevent the use of 36-bit physical addresses.
2. Use a compiler flag to enable the "spectre_v1" mitigation.
3. Apply the "retpoline" mitigation to prevent the use of speculative execution. 
4. Use a hardware-based mitigation, such as Intel's "SSBD" (Supervisor-Mode Access Prevention) feature. 
5. Update the microprocessor to a version that is not vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability. 
6. Use a software-based mitigation, such as the "ibrs" (Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation) feature. 
7. Use a compiler-based mitigation, such as the "spectre_v1
