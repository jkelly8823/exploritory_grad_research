 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7, 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2018-3615) and Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2018-3620) attacks. The functions clear_pmd_presence and clear_pte_presence are not properly mitigating the speculative execution vulnerability. The code is not checking if the speculative execution is enabled before accessing the pmd and pte values. This allows an attacker with local user access to potentially access sensitive information in the L1 data cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to see if the speculative execution is enabled before accessing the pmd and pte values.
2. Use the __spectre_writable() function to check if the pmd and pte values are writable before accessing them.
3. Consider using the __spectre_writable() function to set the pmd and pte values instead of using the set_pmd and set_pte_atomic functions directly.
4. Consider using the __spectre_writable() function to clear the pmd and pte presence bits instead of using the bitwise AND and OR operations directly.
