VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a header file that defines various CPU features and flags. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the CVEs. The code is focused on providing a set of constants and macros for working with CPU features, and does not involve any speculative execution or address translations that could lead to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes to address the vulnerabilities listed in the CVEs. However, it is worth noting that the code does not appear to be implementing any mitigation techniques for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, which may be a concern for systems that are vulnerable to these attacks. Consider adding code to implement mitigation techniques, such as IBRS and IBPB, to protect against these attacks.  Additionally, consider adding code to detect and report the presence of these vulnerabilities. 

Note: The code does not appear to be implementing
