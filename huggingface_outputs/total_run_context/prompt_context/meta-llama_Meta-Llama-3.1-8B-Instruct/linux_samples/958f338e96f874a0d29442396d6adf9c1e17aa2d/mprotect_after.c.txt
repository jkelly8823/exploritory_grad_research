 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, and CVE-2018-3646. The vulnerability is due to the speculative execution and address translations in the system's microprocessor. The code checks for the presence of the vulnerability by calling the prot_none_walk function, which walks the page range and checks for the PFN permission. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as it only checks for the presence of the vulnerability in the current page range, but does not prevent the vulnerability from being exploited in other page ranges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust check for the vulnerability, such as checking for the presence of the vulnerability in all page ranges, not just the current one.
2. Use a more secure method to prevent the vulnerability, such as using a hardware-based solution or a software-based solution that uses a different approach to prevent the vulnerability.
3. Consider using a different microprocessor that does not have the speculative execution and address translations vulnerability. 
4. Implement a mitigation technique, such as retpoline, to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.
