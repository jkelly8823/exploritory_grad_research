 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, and CVE-2018-3646 due to the use of speculative execution and address translations. The max_swapfile_size function checks for the L1TF bug and limits the swap file size accordingly. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as an attacker with local user access can still exploit the bug.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust method to detect the L1TF bug, such as checking the CPUID feature flags.
2. Implement additional mitigations, such as disabling speculative execution or using a different memory allocation scheme.
3. Consider using a secure memory allocation library that is designed to mitigate these types of vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-3615
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and Intel software guard extensions (Intel SGX) may allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache from an enclave to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-3620
