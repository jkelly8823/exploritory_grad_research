 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the L1TF (CVE-2018-3615) and L1D (CVE-2018-3620) side-channel attacks due to the use of the `kvm_set_cpu_l1tf_flush_l1d()` function. This function is used to flush the L1 data cache, which can potentially leak information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the `kvm_set_cpu_l1tf_flush_l1d()` function calls from the `entering_irq()` and `entering_ack_irq()` functions.
2. Consider using a secure alternative to `kvm_set_cpu_l1tf_flush_l1d()` if it is necessary for your use case.
3. Ensure that the `CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC` and `CONFIG_SMP` configuration options are properly set to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
