 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the speculative execution vulnerabilities listed. The code is focused on CPU management and does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the side-channel analysis attacks described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that would be exploitable by an attacker. However, it is always a good practice to keep the code up to date and follow best practices for secure coding.  The code does not appear to contain any obvious security issues, but it is always a good idea to review the code and ensure that it is secure.  Additionally, the code may benefit from additional comments and documentation to improve its maintainability and understandability.  Consider using a code review tool to identify potential issues and improve the overall security of the code.  Consider using a secure coding guide to ensure that the code is following best practices for secure coding.
