 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2018-3620. This is because the code is using speculative execution and address translations, which can allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache to an attacker with local user access via a terminal page fault and a side-channel analysis.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to use a more secure method of address translations, such as using a secure page table.
2. Implement a mechanism to reduce the commit when making a private mapping unwritable again.
3. Consider using a secure microprocessor that does not utilize speculative execution. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date.  VULNERABLE: YES
