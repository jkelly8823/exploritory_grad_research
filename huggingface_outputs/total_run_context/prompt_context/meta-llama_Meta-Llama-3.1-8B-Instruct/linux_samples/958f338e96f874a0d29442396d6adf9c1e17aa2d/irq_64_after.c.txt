 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the vulnerabilities listed. The code includes various kernel headers but does not contain any code that would utilize speculative execution or address translations in a way that would be vulnerable to the described attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.  The code is simply a collection of kernel headers and does not contain any executable code.  It is likely being used as a header file for other kernel code.  If you are looking to mitigate the vulnerabilities described, you should focus on updating your kernel to the latest version and ensuring that you are using the latest security patches.  Additionally, you should ensure that you are following best practices for secure coding and that you are regularly reviewing your code for potential vulnerabilities.  However, these recommendations are not specific to the code sample provided.  They are general recommendations for mitigating the vulnerabilities described.  The code sample itself does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.  It is simply a collection of kernel headers.  It is not executable code and therefore cannot be vulnerable to the described attacks.  The code sample is
