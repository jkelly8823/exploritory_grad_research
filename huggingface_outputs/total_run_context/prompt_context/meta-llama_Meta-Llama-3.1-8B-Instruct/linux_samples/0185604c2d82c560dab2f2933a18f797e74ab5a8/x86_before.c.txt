 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 24
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and host OS crash) due to the lack of resetting the PIT counter values during state restoration. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2015-7513) that can be exploited by a guest OS user by sending a zero value to the PIT counter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reset the PIT counter values to zero during state restoration.
2. Implement a check to prevent sending a zero value to the PIT counter.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle PIT counter values, such as using a secure random number generator. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-7513
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 does not reset the PIT counter values during state restoration, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and host OS crash) via a zero value, related to the kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit and kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit2 functions.  ```bash
