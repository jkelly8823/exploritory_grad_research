 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 28
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and host OS crash) due to the lack of resetting the PIT counter values during state restoration. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel before 4.4, as described in CVE-2015-7513. The vulnerability is present in the kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit and kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit2 functions, specifically in the lines where the PIT counter values are loaded without checking for zero values.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the PIT counter values are not zero before loading them.
2. Reset the PIT counter values to a default value (e.g., 0x10000) during state restoration to prevent divide-by-zero errors.
3. Consider using a more robust method for loading PIT counter values, such as using a safe loading function that checks for zero values. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-7513
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 does not reset the PIT counter values during state restoration, which allows
