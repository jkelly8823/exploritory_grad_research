VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The function ext4_get_bitmap() may return a bitmap that has been modified by another process between the time it is retrieved and the time it is used. This can lead to incorrect checksums being calculated and potentially allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from a deleted file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to ensure that the bitmap is not modified between the time it is retrieved and the time it is used.
2. Consider using a more robust locking mechanism, such as a spinlock or a mutex, to prevent other processes from modifying the bitmap while it is being used.
3. Ensure that the bitmap is properly marked as uninitialized when a file is deleted to prevent this type of vulnerability.  ```bash

VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The user input is not properly sanitized and is directly used in the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially extract sensitive data or take control of the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements
