VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-4508
CVE Description:
Race condition in fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel before 3.4.16 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from a deleted file by reading an extent that was not properly marked as uninitialized.  The race condition occurs when a process is deleting a file and another process is reading the file's extent at the same time.  The extent is not properly marked as uninitialized, allowing the reading process to obtain sensitive information from the deleted file.  This vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to
