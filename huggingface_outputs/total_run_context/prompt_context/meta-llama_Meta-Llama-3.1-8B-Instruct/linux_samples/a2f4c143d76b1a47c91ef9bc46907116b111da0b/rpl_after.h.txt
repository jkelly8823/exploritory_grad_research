 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that handles the RPL protocol or user-supplied data. The function rpl_exit is declared but not used, and the ipv6_rpl_srh_size and ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress functions are declared but their implementation is not shown. The lack of implementation makes it difficult to assess the vulnerability. However, based on the provided code, there is no indication of the vulnerability CVE-2023-2156.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement the ipv6_rpl_srh_size and ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress functions to ensure proper handling of user-supplied data. Additionally, review the implementation of these functions to ensure they do not introduce any vulnerabilities. Consider using secure coding practices, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential security issues.  Review the code for any potential buffer overflows or other security issues.  Consider using a code review tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a static analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a code review process to identify potential security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a secure coding standard to ensure the code is secure.  Consider
