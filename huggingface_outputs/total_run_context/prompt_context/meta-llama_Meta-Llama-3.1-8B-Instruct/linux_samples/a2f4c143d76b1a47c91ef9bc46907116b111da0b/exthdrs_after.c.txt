 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service condition due to the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data in the RPL protocol. Specifically, the code does not validate the size of the SRH (Segment Routing Header) before attempting to pull it from the packet. This can lead to an assertion failure and a denial of service condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size of the SRH before attempting to pull it from the packet.
2. Use a secure method to handle user-supplied data, such as using a whitelist of allowed sizes or performing bounds checking.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol or implementation that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-2156
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the networking subsystem of the Linux kernel within the handling of the RPL protocol. This issue results from the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion failure. This may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system. 

Code Sample:
		struct sk_buff *skb = NULL;
