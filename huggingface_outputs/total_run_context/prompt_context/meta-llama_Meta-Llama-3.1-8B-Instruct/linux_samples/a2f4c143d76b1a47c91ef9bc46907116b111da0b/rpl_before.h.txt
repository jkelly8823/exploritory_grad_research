 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that handles user-supplied data or the RPL protocol. The function rpl_exit() is declared but not used, and the macro IPV6_RPL_SRH_WORST_SWAP_SIZE is defined but does not appear to be related to the vulnerability. The function ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress() is declared but its implementation is not provided, and it does not appear to be related to the vulnerability. Therefore, the code snippet does not contain the vulnerability CVE-2023-2156.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any code that handles user-supplied data or the RPL protocol, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the function ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress() to ensure it does not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities.  The function rpl_exit() is declared but not used, it is recommended to remove it to avoid any potential issues.  The macro IPV6_RPL_SRH_WORST_SWAP_SIZE is defined but does not appear to be related
