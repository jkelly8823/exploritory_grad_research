 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and system crash) due to a crafted signal frame sent via a sigreturn() system call. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where hardware transactional memory is disabled, allowing a local user to cause a system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that hardware transactional memory is enabled before attempting to recheckpoint on return.
2. Implement proper error handling for the case where hardware transactional memory is disabled.
3. Consider using a more robust method to handle signal frames, such as using a dedicated signal handling function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-13648
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel through 5.2.1 on the powerpc platform, when hardware transactional memory is disabled, a local user can cause a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and system crash) via a sigreturn() system call that sends a crafted signal frame. This affects arch/powerpc/kernel/signal_32.c and arch/powerpc/kernel/signal_64.c.  CVE_ID:C
