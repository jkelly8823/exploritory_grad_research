 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-13648 vulnerability because it does not properly handle the case where hardware transactional memory is disabled. When the MSR_TM_ACTIVE check fails, the code attempts to start TM on a non-TM system, which can lead to a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and system crash). This is a classic example of a vulnerability that can be exploited by a local user.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that hardware transactional memory is enabled before attempting to start TM.
2. Handle the case where hardware transactional memory is disabled by not attempting to start TM.
3. Consider adding additional error handling to prevent the system from crashing in case of an error.  ```c
if (MSR_TM_ACTIVE(msr_hi<<32)) {
    if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTR_TM)) {
        tm_restore = 1;
    } else {
        /* Handle the case where TM is disabled */
        tm_restore = 0;
    }
} else {
    /* Handle the case where TM is not active */
    tm_restore = 0;
}
