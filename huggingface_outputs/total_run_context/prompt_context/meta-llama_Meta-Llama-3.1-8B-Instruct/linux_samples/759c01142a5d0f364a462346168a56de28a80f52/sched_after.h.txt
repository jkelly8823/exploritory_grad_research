 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4312. The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's handling of UNIX sockets and file descriptors, which is not present in this code snippet. The code appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's memory management or networking code, but it does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to bypass file-descriptor limits.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire Linux kernel to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to apply the relevant patches to the Linux kernel to address the CVE-2013-4312 vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4312
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it, related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/un
