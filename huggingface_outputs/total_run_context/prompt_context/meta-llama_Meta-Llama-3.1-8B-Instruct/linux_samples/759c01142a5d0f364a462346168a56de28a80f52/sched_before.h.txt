 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would allow a local user to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) as described in CVE-2013-4312. The code snippet appears to be a part of the Linux kernel and contains variables related to file descriptors and keyrings, but it does not contain any code that would allow a user to exploit the vulnerability described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would allow a user to exploit the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-4312. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure that it is secure and does not contain any other vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4312
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it, related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/unix/garbage.c. 

Code Sample:
int x =
