 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the lack of proper handling of file-descriptor limits. The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 has a bug that allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it. This vulnerability is related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/unix/garbage.c.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Update the Linux kernel to version 4.4.1 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2.  Implement proper handling of file-descriptor limits to prevent similar attacks in the future.
3.  Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is secure and up-to-date.  ```bash
