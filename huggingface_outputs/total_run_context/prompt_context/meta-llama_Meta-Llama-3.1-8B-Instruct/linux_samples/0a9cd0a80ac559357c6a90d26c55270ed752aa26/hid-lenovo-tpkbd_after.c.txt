 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based out-of-bounds write due to the lack of bounds checking in the hid_validate_values function. This function does not check if the report ID is within the valid range, allowing an attacker to potentially write to arbitrary memory locations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the hid_validate_values function to ensure that the report ID is within the valid range.
2. Consider using a safer function, such as hid_validate_report, which already includes bounds checking.
3. Review the code to ensure that all report IDs are validated properly to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000253
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.12.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted USB device, related to the "usb gadget" subsystem.

Code Sample:
	struct usb_gadget *gadget;
	struct usb_function *func;
	struct usb_function_instance *func_inst;
	struct usb_ep *ep;
	struct usb_request *req;
	int ret;

	gadget = usb_gadget
