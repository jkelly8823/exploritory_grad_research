 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-3773 due to the presence of NLA_REJECT in the netlink attributes. This can lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read when parsing netlink attributes, allowing a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to leak sensitive heap data to userspace.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace NLA_REJECT with a valid type, such as NLA_U32 or NLA_S32, to prevent the out-of-bounds read.
2. Consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the parsed attributes are within the expected range. This can help prevent potential vulnerabilities. 
3. Review the netlink attribute handling code to ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2023-3773
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem). This issue may allow a malicious user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to cause a 4 byte out-of-bounds read of XFRMA_MTIMER_THRESH when parsing netlink attributes, leading to potential leakage of
