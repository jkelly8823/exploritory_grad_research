 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2013-6376. The recalculate_apic_map function is not shown in the provided code, but the presence of the kvm_x2apic_msr_write function suggests that the code is using x2apic mode, which is related to the vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a guest OS user to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code for the recalculate_apic_map function to ensure it is properly implemented and handles ICR write operations in x2apic mode.
- Consider adding input validation and sanitization for the ICR write operation to prevent crafted input from causing a denial of service. 
- Ensure that the code properly handles errors and exceptions that may occur during the ICR write operation.
