 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code is creating a new vcpu and checking for errors, but it does not involve any of the specific functions or operations that are vulnerable to the listed CVEs.
