 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Netlink implementation vulnerability in the Linux kernel. The vulnerability allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the stdout or stderr of a setuid program. This is because the code does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket.
2. Use capabilities to restrict access to sensitive operations.
3. Validate the capabilities of the socket opener before allowing access to sensitive operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program.  The code sample provided does not contain the Netlink socket creation for stdout or stderr, but the vulnerability is still present due
