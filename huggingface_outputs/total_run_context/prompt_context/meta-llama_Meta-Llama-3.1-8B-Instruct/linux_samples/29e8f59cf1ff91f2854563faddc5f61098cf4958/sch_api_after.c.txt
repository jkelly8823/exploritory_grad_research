EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly check the capabilities of the user before performing certain operations. In the first instance, the code checks if the nlmsg_type is not RTM_GETQDISC and if the user does not have CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, it returns an error. However, this check is not sufficient as it does not prevent a local user from bypassing intended access restrictions. In the second instance, the code checks if the user has CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before performing the nlmsg_parse operation. However, this check is also insufficient as it does not prevent a local user from modifying network configurations. The third instance is similar to the second instance. The code is vulnerable because it does not properly authorize socket operations based on the opener of a socket.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The code should be modified to properly check the capabilities of the user before performing certain operations. This can be done by using the capabilities system calls to check if the user has the required capabilities.
2. The code should be modified to prevent a local user from bypassing intended
