 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket. In this code, the netlink_capable function is used to check if the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is present. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access, as a local user can bypass the intended access restrictions by using a Netlink socket for the stdout or stderr of a setuid program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust authorization mechanism that takes into account the opener of the socket.
2. Use a more secure method to check for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, such as using the capabilities subsystem.
3. Consider using a different socket type that is not susceptible to this vulnerability.
