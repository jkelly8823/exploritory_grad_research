 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it does not properly check for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before allowing access to the Netlink socket. The check is performed twice, but the second check is incorrect and will allow unauthorized access. This is because the second check returns -EINVAL instead of -EPERM, which is the correct error code for an unauthorized access attempt.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the second check and only keep the first check.
2. Replace the second check with the correct error code, -EPERM.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate authorization mechanism for Netlink socket operations.  ```c
if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
	return -EPERM;
```  ```c
if (!net_eq(net, &init_net))
	return -EPERM;
