 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided checks for the capability of CAP_NET_ADMIN before allowing any changes to be made. This is a correct implementation of the check for the vulnerability CVE-2014-0181. The capability check ensures that only privileged users can perform the operation, thus preventing local users from bypassing intended access restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain the vulnerability.  The capability check is correctly implemented.  However, it would be beneficial to include a comment explaining the purpose of the capability check to improve code readability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program.  This vulnerability is related to the lack of capability checks in the code.  The code snippet provided checks for the capability of CAP_NET_ADMIN, which is a correct implementation
