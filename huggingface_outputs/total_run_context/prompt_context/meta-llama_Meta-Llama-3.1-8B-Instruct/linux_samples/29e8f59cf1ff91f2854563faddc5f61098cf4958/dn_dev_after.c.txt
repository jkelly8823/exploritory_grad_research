VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not properly check for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before allowing socket operations. This allows a local user to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations. The code checks for the capability twice, but the second check is incorrect and should be -EPERM instead of -EINVAL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the second check for CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
2. Change the second check to return -EPERM instead of -EINVAL. 
3. Consider adding additional checks to ensure that the socket operations are authorized based on the opener of the socket. 4. Consider using a more secure mechanism for authorizing socket operations, such as using a separate authorization module. 5. Consider using a more secure way to handle the socket operations, such as using a separate thread or process. 6. Consider adding logging to track any unauthorized socket operations. 7. Consider adding a mechanism to revoke the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability after the socket operations are completed. 8. Consider using a more secure way to handle the socket operations, such
