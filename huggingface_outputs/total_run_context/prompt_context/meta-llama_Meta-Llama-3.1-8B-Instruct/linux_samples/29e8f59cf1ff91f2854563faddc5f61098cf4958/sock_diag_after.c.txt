 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. This is because the Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket. In this code, the sock_diag_put_filterinfo function is called with a struct sock pointer, which can be used to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions before allowing the socket operation. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not allow local users to modify network configurations through the use of a Netlink socket.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for
