 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it does not properly check the capabilities of the socket opener. The netlink_capable function is used to check if the socket has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, but this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access. The code should check the capabilities of the original opener of the socket, not the current opener.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the netlink_capable function with the NETLINK_CAPABLE_CHECK_OWNER flag to check the capabilities of the original opener of the socket. This can be done by replacing the line `if ((n->nlmsg_type!= RTM_GETTFILTER) &&!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))` with `if ((n->nlmsg_type!= RTM_GETTFILTER) &&!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN, NETLINK_CAPABLE_CHECK_OWNER))`. Additionally, the code should also check the capabilities of the original opener of the socket in the replay loop to prevent unauthorized access. This can be done by adding a check `if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN
