 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it does not properly authorize socket operations based on the opener of a socket. The check for CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is present, but it is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access. The net_eq function is used to check if the network is the initial network, but this check is also not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access. The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user who can use a Netlink socket for the stdout or stderr of a setuid program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust authorization mechanism, such as checking the effective user ID of the process that opened the socket.
2. Use a more secure method to check the network, such as using the netlink socket's peer address.
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a whitelist of allowed networks or users. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which
