 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. This is because the netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN) function is used to check if the socket operation is authorized. However, this function does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket. This allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more secure method to authorize socket operations, such as checking the socket's file descriptor or the process's credentials.
2. Implement a mechanism to restrict access to Netlink sockets based on the opener of the socket.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as a message authentication code (MAC), to authenticate and authorize socket operations.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows
