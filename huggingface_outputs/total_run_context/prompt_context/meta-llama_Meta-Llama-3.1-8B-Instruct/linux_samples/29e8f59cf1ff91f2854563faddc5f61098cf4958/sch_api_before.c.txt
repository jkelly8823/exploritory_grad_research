 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 8, 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. This is because the code checks for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before parsing the Netlink message, but it does not check if the capability was set by the opener of the socket. This allows a local user to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the stdout or stderr of a setuid program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the capability was set by the opener of the socket before parsing the Netlink message.
2. Use the nlmsg_parse_nested function to parse the Netlink message, which checks the capability of the opener of the socket.
3. Remove the CAP_NET_ADMIN check and use the nlmsg_parse_nested function to parse the Netlink message. This will ensure that the capability of the opener of the socket is checked before parsing the Netlink message.
