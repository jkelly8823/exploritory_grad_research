 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it does not properly authorize socket operations based on the opener of a socket. The netlink_capable function is used to check if the skb has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, but this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access. The code should use a more robust authorization mechanism to prevent local users from bypassing intended access restrictions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust authorization mechanism, such as a role-based access control system, to prevent unauthorized access to network configurations.
2. Implement a mechanism to authorize socket operations based on the opener of a socket, such as by storing the opener's credentials in the skb and checking them against a list of authorized users.
3. Consider using a secure communication protocol, such as TLS, to encrypt and authenticate network communications. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
