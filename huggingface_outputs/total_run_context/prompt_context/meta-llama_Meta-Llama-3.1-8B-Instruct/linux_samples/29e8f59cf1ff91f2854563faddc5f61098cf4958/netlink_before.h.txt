 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly relates to the Netlink implementation or socket operations. It appears to be a header file that declares function prototypes for netlink_add_tap and netlink_remove_tap, but does not include any executable code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0181.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any vulnerable code, and no recommendations are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of netlink_add_tap and netlink_remove_tap functions in the Linux kernel to ensure they do not introduce any vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using secure coding practices and authorization mechanisms to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program.
