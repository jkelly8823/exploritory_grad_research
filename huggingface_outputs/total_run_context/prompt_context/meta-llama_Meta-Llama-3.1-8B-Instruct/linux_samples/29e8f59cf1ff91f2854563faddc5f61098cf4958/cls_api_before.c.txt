 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it does not properly check the capabilities of the user before performing a Netlink operation. The line "if ((n->nlmsg_type!= RTM_GETTFILTER) &&!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))" checks if the user has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, but it does not check if the user is the same as the opener of the socket. This allows a local user to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the user is the same as the opener of the socket before performing the Netlink operation.
2. Use a more secure method to authorize socket operations, such as using a secure socket API. 
3. Consider using a capability system that is more secure than the current one. 
4. Review the code to ensure that all Netlink operations are properly authorized.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations
