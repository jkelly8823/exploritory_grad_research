 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2, 6-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability. The issue is that the code checks for CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities, but it does not check if the socket was opened by the same user who is making the socket operation. This allows a local user to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the stdout or stderr of a setuid program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the socket's owner and ensure that it matches the current user before performing any operations. This can be done by using the getsockopt function to retrieve the socket's owner and comparing it to the current user's ID. Additionally, the code should also check for the CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities, but it should do so in a way that takes into account the socket's owner. This can be done by using the capget function to retrieve the capabilities of the socket's owner and checking if they include CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
