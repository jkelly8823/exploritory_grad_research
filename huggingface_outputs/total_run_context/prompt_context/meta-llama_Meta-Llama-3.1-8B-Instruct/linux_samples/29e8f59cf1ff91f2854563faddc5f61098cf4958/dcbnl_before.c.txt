 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it checks for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before allowing the RTM_SETDCB operation. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access because it only checks the capability of the current process, not the capability of the process that opened the socket. This allows a local user to bypass the intended access restrictions by using a Netlink socket for the stdout or stderr of a setuid program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the nlmsg_hdr() function to get the nlmsghdr structure from the nlmsk structure, and then check the nlmsg_pid field to verify the sender's capability.
2. Use the nlmsg_getattr() function to get the nlmsg_attr structure from the nlmsk structure, and then check the nlmsg_attr->attr_type field to verify the sender's capability.
3. Implement a more robust authorization mechanism that takes into account the capability of the process that opened the socket, rather than just the capability of the current process. This could involve using the nlmsg_hdr() function to get the nlmsghdr structure from the nlmsk
