 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly implements the Netlink socket operations. The functions provided are declarations for various Netlink-related functions, but they do not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-0181. The vulnerability is related to the lack of authorization for socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which is not directly addressed in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could introduce the vulnerability, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is worth noting that the code sample is a header file, and the actual implementation of the Netlink socket operations would be in a separate source file. It is still important to ensure that the implementation of these operations is secure and follows best practices for authorization and access control.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181, CVE_Description:The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using
