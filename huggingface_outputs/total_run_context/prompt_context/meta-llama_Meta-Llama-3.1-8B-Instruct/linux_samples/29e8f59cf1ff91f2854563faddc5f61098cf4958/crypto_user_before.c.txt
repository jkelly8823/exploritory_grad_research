 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-0181 vulnerability because it does not properly authorize socket operations based on the opener of a socket. The check for CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is present, but it is not sufficient to prevent a local user from bypassing intended access restrictions. The vulnerability is present in the line where the capability check is performed, as well as the lines where the Netlink socket operations are performed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust authorization mechanism that takes into account the opener of the socket.
2. Use a secure method to verify the capability of the user, such as using the `capable` function with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
3. Consider using a secure socket API that provides built-in authorization and access control mechanisms.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0181
CVE Description:
The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (
