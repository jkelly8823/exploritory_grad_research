 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the removal of the softreq from the response list and the destruction of the softreq in the same iteration. This can lead to a situation where the softreq is accessed after it has been freed, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the softreq_destroy(sr) call to after the callback function has been called. This ensures that the softreq is not accessed after it has been freed.
2. Consider using a lock to protect the response list and the softreq destruction to prevent race conditions.
