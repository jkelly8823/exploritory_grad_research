 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured and does not exhibit any signs of a Use-after-Free or Information Leak. The mutex lock is properly used to prevent concurrent access to the cache_size_mutex.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications. However, it would be beneficial to add additional error checking to handle potential edge cases. Additionally, consider using a more robust locking mechanism, such as a spinlock, to improve performance in high-concurrency scenarios.  ```bash
