 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a header file that declares function prototypes and structures related to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) devices. There are no functions or code that could lead to a Use-after-Free (CVE-2019-7221) or Information Leak (CVE-2019-7222) vulnerabilities. The code also does not contain any code that could lead to a use-after-free due to a race condition (CVE-2019-6974).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security.  ```bash
