 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free error due to the race condition between the ib_copy_to_udata function and the kvfree function. The ib_copy_to_udata function may copy the srq->srqn value to the udata buffer before the kvfree function frees the srq->wrid memory. This can lead to a use-after-free error when the srq->wrid memory is accessed after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to protect the access to the srq->wrid memory and the srq->srqn value.
2. Use a temporary variable to store the srq->srqn value before freeing the srq->wrid memory.
3. Use a different approach to copy the srq->srqn value to the udata buffer that does not involve freeing the srq->wrid memory in the same function.
