RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and follow secure coding practices.  The code could benefit from additional comments to improve readability and maintainability.  Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of code and any complex logic.  Additionally, consider using a code review tool to catch any potential issues before they become a problem.  Finally, ensure that the code is properly tested to catch any issues that may have been introduced during development.  Consider using a testing framework to write automated tests for the code.  This will help to ensure that the code is reliable and functions as expected.  Consider using a code analysis tool to identify any potential issues with the code.  This will help to ensure that the code is secure and follows best practices.  Consider using a code review process to catch any
