 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code is setting up the CR3 register with a trampoline page table offset, and then enabling PAE and LA57 (if required) paging modes. There is no indication of a use-after-free or information leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it would be beneficial to review the code in the context of the surrounding system to ensure that it is being used correctly and that there are no other potential vulnerabilities.
