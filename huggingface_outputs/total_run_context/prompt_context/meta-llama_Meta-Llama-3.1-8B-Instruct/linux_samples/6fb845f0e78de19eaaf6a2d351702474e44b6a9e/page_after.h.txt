 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation. It defines macros for working with page directory entries (PDEs) and page table entries (PTEs). The code does not contain any obvious references to the vulnerabilities listed (CVE-2019-7221, CVE-2019-7222, CVE-2019-6974). The code seems to be focused on providing a framework for working with memory mappings, rather than implementing the KVM functionality that is vulnerable to these issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the listed CVEs. However, it is essential to note that this code is part of a larger system, and vulnerabilities could still exist elsewhere in the codebase. A thorough review of the entire codebase is recommended to ensure the absence of vulnerabilities.  ```
