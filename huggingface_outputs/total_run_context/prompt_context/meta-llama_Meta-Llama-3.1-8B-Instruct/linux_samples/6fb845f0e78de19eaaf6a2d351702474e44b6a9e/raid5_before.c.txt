 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious use-after-free or information leak issues. The mutex lock is properly used to prevent concurrent access to the cache_size_mutex.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications. However, it would be beneficial to add error handling for the grow_one_stripe function to ensure that any potential errors are properly handled.
