 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to a race condition. The spin_unlock_irqrestore function is called before blk_mq_sched_restart, which can lead to a situation where the fq->mq_flush_lock is released before the blk_mq_sched_restart function is executed. This can cause a use-after-free bug if the blk_mq_sched_restart function tries to access the fq->mq_flush_lock after it has been released.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the blk_mq_sched_restart function call after the spin_unlock_irqrestore function call to ensure that the lock is released after the function is executed.
2. Consider using a lock that is not released until the blk_mq_sched_restart function is executed to prevent the use-after-free bug.
