 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the line "of_node_put(iommu_spec.np);". This line releases the reference to the iommu_spec.np node before it is used in the mtk_iommu_create_mapping function. This can lead to a use-after-free bug if the iommu_spec.np node is accessed after it has been released.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Move the "of_node_put(iommu_spec.np);" line to after the mtk_iommu_create_mapping function call to ensure that the node is not released before it is used.
- Alternatively, create a local copy of the iommu_spec.np node before releasing the reference to the original node. This will ensure that the node is not released before it is used.
