VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. This is due to the fact that the service_task is being cancelled in the out_notify_fail and out_read_prop_fail paths, but the service_task is not being checked for NULL before being cancelled. This could potentially lead to a use-after-free error if the service_task has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the service_task is NULL before cancelling it to prevent potential use-after-free errors.
2. Consider using a lock to protect access to the service_task to prevent concurrent access and potential use-after-free errors. 
3. Review the code to ensure that the service_task is not being accessed after it has been freed.  This may involve adding additional checks or using a different data structure to manage the service_task.  ```c
if (priv->service_task!= NULL) {
    (void)cancel_work_sync(&priv->service_task);
}
``` 
4. Consider using a more robust way to handle the service_task, such as using a reference counting mechanism to ensure that the task is not freed until it is no longer in use.  ```c
if (
