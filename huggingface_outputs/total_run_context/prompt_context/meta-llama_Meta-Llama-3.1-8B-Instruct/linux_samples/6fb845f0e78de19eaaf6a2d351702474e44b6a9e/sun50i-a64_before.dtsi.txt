 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a device tree binding for a video codec on an Allwinner SoC. It does not contain any obvious references to the KVM implementation or the Linux kernel, which are the targets of the provided CVEs. The code seems to be focused on hardware configuration and does not exhibit any signs of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to review and update device tree bindings to ensure they are compatible with the latest kernel versions and hardware configurations. Additionally, consider using tools like `devicetree-checker` to validate the device tree syntax and structure.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
