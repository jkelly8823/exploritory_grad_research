 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious use-after-free or information leak issues. The code also checks for valid input values before proceeding, which reduces the likelihood of errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any changes. However, it would be beneficial to add more comments to explain the purpose of the code and the logic behind it. This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.
