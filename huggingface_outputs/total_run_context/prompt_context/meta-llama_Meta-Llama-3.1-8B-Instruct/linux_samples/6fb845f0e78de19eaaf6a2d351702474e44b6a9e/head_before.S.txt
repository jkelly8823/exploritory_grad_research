 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The variable a2 is used before it is initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMATION:
The code should be modified to ensure that variables are initialized before they are used. This can be done by adding a movi instruction before the first use of a2. For example: movi a2, 0. This will ensure that a2 is initialized to a valid value before it is used.
