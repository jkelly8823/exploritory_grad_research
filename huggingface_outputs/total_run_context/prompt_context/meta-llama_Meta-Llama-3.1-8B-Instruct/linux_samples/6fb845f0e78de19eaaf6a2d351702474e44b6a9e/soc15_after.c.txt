 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code is checking for specific conditions and assigning values to variables based on those conditions. There is no evidence of a use-after-free or information leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.  ```bash
