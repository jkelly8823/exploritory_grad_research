 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's KVM implementation, but it does not exhibit any of the characteristics of the Use-after-Free (CVE-2019-7221) or Information Leak (CVE-2019-7222) vulnerabilities. The code also does not contain any race conditions that could lead to a use-after-free (CVE-2019-6974).
