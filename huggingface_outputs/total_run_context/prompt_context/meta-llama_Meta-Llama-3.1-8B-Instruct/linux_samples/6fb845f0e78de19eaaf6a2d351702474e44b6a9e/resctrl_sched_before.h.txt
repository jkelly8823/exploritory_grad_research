 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code is a header file that includes other necessary headers and defines a function resctrl_sched_in. However, this function is empty and does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a Use-after-Free or Information Leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is clean and does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the included headers to ensure that they do not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, the empty function resctrl_sched_in could be removed if it is not intended to be used.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
