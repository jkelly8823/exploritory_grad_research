 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a configuration snippet for a Linux kernel, and it does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a Use-after-Free (CVE-2019-7221) or Information Leak (CVE-2019-7222). The code also does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a use-after-free due to a race condition (CVE-2019-6974).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be a valid configuration snippet and does not require any changes. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure that it is working as expected. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the Linux kernel up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```bash
