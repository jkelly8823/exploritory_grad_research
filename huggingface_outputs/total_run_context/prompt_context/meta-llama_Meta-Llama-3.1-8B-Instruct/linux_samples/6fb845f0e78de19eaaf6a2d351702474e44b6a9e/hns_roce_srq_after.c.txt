 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the race condition between the allocation and deallocation of the srq and wrid resources. The srq resource is freed in the err_srqc_alloc label, but the wrid resource is freed in the err_wrid label, which may be executed before the err_srqc_alloc label if an error occurs in the ib_copy_to_udata function. This can lead to a use-after-free bug when the wrid resource is accessed after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a single error handling label to ensure that all resources are freed in the correct order.
2. Use a lock to protect the allocation and deallocation of the srq and wrid resources to prevent race conditions.
3. Check the return value of the ib_copy_to_udata function before freeing the srq resource to ensure that the wrid resource is not freed prematurely.
