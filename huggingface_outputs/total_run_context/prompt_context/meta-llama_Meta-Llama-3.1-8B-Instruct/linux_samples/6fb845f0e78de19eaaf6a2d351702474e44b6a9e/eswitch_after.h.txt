 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of a driver for the Mellanox ConnectX-5 InfiniBand adapter, and it does not contain any obvious references to the KVM implementation or the Linux kernel.
