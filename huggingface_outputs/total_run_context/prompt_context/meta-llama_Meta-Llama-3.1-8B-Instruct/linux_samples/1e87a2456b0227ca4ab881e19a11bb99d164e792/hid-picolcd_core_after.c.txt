 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference and OOPS due to a crafted device. This is because the code does not properly validate the input from the device, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is present in the line where the code checks if the report is valid, but does not check if the report is null before accessing its members.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a null check for the report pointer before accessing its members.
2. Validate the input from the device to prevent a crafted device from causing a denial of service. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-2136
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel 3.0 through 3.2 on x86-64 systems allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted application that triggers a large number of page faults, leading to a denial of service due to a lack of memory.

Code Sample:
		for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
			char *ptr = malloc(1024);
			*ptr = 0;
			free
