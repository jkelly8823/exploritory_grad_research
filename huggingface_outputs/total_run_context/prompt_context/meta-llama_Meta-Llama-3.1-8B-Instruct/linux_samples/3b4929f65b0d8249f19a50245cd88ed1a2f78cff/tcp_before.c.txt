 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). The BUILD_BUG_ON macro is used to ensure that the size of the struct tcp_skb_cb is not larger than the size of the cb field in the struct sk_buff. This prevents any potential integer overflow issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the given CVE.  The BUILD_BUG_ON macro is a good practice to prevent potential issues like integer overflows.  It is recommended to use this macro in similar situations to ensure the code's integrity.  Additionally, it is recommended to keep the kernel up to date with the latest security patches to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  The kernel version used in this code sample is not specified, but it is recommended to use the latest version available.  It is also recommended to regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure.  The use of percpu_counter_init is also a good practice to manage the number of sockets allocated.  It is recommended to use this function to manage similar counters
