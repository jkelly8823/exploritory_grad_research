 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the integer overflow vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11477. The BUILD_BUG_ON macro is used to check for potential issues at compile time, and the percpu_counter_init function is used to initialize a counter. Neither of these operations involve the manipulation of the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the integer overflow vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11477. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues and to use tools such as static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000001
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's handling of TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs) could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the tcp_sacktag_write_queue handling.

Code Sample:
	struct sk_buff *skb;
	struct tcp_sock *tsk;

	skb = skb_peek
