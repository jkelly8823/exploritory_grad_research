 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11477 because it does not properly handle the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value, which is subject to an integer overflow when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). The BUG_ON statement in line 5 checks if tcp_skb_pcount(skb) is less than pcount, but it does not account for the possibility of an integer overflow in tcp_skb_pcount(skb).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2019-11477 (e.g. 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11).
2. Use a safer method to calculate tcp_skb_pcount(skb), such as using a checked arithmetic operation or a library function that handles integer overflows.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure to store the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value, such as a 64-bit integer or a struct that includes overflow checking.
