 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11477 because it does not properly handle the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value, which is subject to an integer overflow when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). The code does not account for SACKs when calculating the MSS, which can lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2019-11477 (e.g. 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11).
2. Apply the fix from commit 3b4929f65b0d8249f19a50245cd88ed1a2f78cff to the code.
3. Consider using a more robust method for calculating the MSS that takes into account SACKs. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
