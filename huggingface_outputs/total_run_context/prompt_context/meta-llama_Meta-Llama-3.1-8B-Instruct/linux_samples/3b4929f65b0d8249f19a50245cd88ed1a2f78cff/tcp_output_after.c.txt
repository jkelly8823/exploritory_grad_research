 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that handles TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs) or the calculation of TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs. The code snippet appears to be calculating the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for a TCP packet, but it does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-11477 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-11477 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it is secure and free of vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-11477
CVE Description:
Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value was subject to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.
