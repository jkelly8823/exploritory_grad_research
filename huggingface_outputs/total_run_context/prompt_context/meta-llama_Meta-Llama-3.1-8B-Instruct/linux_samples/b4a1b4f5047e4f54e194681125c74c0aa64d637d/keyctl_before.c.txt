 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition between keyctl_revoke and keyctl_read calls. This is because the key->sem semaphore is not properly used to prevent concurrent access to the key. The down_read function is used to acquire the semaphore, but it is not checked if the semaphore is already held by another thread. This allows a local user to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock instead of a semaphore to prevent concurrent access to the key.
2. Check if the semaphore is already held by another thread before acquiring it.
3. Use a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex, to prevent race conditions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-7550
CVE Description:
The keyctl_read_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.4 does not properly use a semaphore, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that lever
