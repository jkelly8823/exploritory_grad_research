 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-18955 because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. This allows a user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace to bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace. The specific lines of code that are vulnerable are 6-8, where the lower ids are mapped from the parent user namespace to the kernel global id space without proper ID transformation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that ID transformation takes place properly for both the namespaced-to-kernel and kernel-to-namespaced directions.
2. Implement proper checks to prevent users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN from bypassing access controls on resources outside the namespace.
3. Consider using a more secure method for mapping user IDs, such as using a secure hash function. 
4. Review and update the code to ensure it is compliant with the latest security guidelines and best practices. 5. Consider using a code review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the code is secure. 6. Implement a testing plan to verify the security of the code and ensure it is free from vulnerabilities. 7. Consider using a secure
