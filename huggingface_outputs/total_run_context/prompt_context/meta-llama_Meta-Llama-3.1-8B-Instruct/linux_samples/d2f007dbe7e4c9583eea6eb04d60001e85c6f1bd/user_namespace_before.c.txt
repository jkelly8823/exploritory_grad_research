 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-18955 because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges. The issue arises from the fact that an ID transformation takes place properly for the namespaced-to-kernel direction but not for the kernel-to-namespaced direction. This allows a user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN in an affected user namespace to bypass access controls on resources outside the namespace.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper ID transformation for the kernel-to-namespaced direction.
2.  Limit the number of UID or GID ranges to 5 to prevent nested user namespaces.
3.  Validate user input to prevent privilege escalation attacks.  ```c
if (new_idmap_permitted(file, ns, cap_setid, &new_map)) {
    // Perform ID transformation for kernel-to-namespaced direction
    //...
}
