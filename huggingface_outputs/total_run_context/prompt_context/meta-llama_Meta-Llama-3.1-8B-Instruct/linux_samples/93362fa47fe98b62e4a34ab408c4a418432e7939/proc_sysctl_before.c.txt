 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (system hang) due to the mishandling of certain drain operations in the cgroup offline implementation. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11. The code attempts to iterate over the sysctl entries using the `first_entry` and `next_entry` macros, but it does not properly handle the case where the iteration is interrupted. This can lead to a system hang.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more robust iteration mechanism, such as a loop that checks for the end of the list.
2. Implement proper error handling to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur during iteration.
3. Consider using a more modern and secure way to iterate over sysctl entries, such as using a `for` loop with a `while` condition.

CVE_ID:CVE-2016-9191
CVE Description:
The cgroup offline implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 mishandles certain drain operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by leveraging access to a container
