 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the improper handling of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations. The code attempts to access the redirtbl array with an index that may be out of bounds, leading to a potential information leak. Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where the index is out of bounds, resulting in a denial of service (host OS OOPS).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the index before accessing the redirtbl array to prevent out-of-bounds access.
2. Handle the case where the index is out of bounds by returning an error or a default value instead of attempting to access the array.
3. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash table, to store the redirection table entries. This would eliminate the need to use an array with a fixed size. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG
