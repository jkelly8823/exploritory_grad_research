 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. The code allocates a new page from the page pool using page_pool_alloc_pages with the __GFP_ZERO flag, which ensures that the page is zeroed before being returned. This prevents any potential data leaks from the frontend to the backend.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications to address the described vulnerabilities.  ```bash

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-33741
CVE Description:
Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).

Code Sample:
	struct page *page;
	struct scatterlist *sg;
	struct scatterlist *sg_first;
	struct scatterlist *sg
