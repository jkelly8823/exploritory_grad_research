 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of mutex_lock and write_lock_irqsave. The mutex_lock is released before the write_lock_irqsave is unlocked, which can lead to a use-after-free situation if another thread tries to access the port before the write_lock_irqsave is unlocked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a single lock to protect the critical section of code.
2. Use a lock that is designed for use with IRQs, such as a spinlock.
3. Use a lock that is designed for use with mutexes, such as a mutex with a recursive lock.
4. Use a lock-free data structure to avoid the need for locks altogether. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-15265
CVE Description:
Race condition in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.13.8 allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted /dev/snd/seq ioctl calls, related to sound/core/seq/seq_clientmgr.c and sound/core/seq/seq_ports.c.  VULNER
