VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7308
CVE Description:
The packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 does not properly validate certain block-size data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer signedness error and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the CAP_NET_RAW capability is held), via crafted system calls.

Code Sample:
int foo(int x, int y)
{
	int result =
