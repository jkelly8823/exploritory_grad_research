 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (integer signedness error and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the CAP_NET_RAW capability is held), via crafted system calls. This is due to the lack of proper validation of certain block-size data in the packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c. The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2017-7308.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the block-size data properly in the packet_set_ring function to prevent integer signedness errors and out-of-bounds writes.
2. Implement proper capability checks to prevent privilege escalation.
3. Update the kernel to the latest version to ensure that the vulnerability is patched. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7308
CVE Description:
The packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 does not properly validate certain block-size data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer signedness error and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the CAP_NET_RAW capability is held), via crafted system calls.
