 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (integer signedness error and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the CAP_NET_RAW capability is held), via crafted system calls. This is due to the lack of proper validation of certain block-size data in the packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the block-size data properly to prevent integer signedness errors and out-of-bounds writes.
2. Implement proper checks for the CAP_NET_RAW capability to prevent privilege escalation.
3. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g., 4.10.7 or later). 
4. Use a secure coding practice to limit the things done before cpu_init() to the most necessary things. 5. Use a secure coding practice to limit the things done before cpu_init() to the most necessary things. 6. Use a secure coding practice to limit the things done before cpu_init() to the most necessary things. 7. Use a secure coding practice to limit the things done before
