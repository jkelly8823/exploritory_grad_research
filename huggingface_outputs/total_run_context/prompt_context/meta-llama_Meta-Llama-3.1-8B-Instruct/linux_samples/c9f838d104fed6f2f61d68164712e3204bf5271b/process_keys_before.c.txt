 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the lack of bounds checking on the keyring_alloc function. This function is called with KEY_ALLOC_QUOTA_OVERRUN flag, which allows the keyring to overrun the quota. This can lead to memory consumption and potentially cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the keyring_alloc function to prevent it from overrunning the quota.
2. Consider using a more secure allocation method, such as using a custom allocator that takes into account the quota.
3. Review the code to ensure that the quota is properly set and not exceeded. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7472
CVE Description:
The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.10.13 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring calls.  This vulnerability is present in the code sample provided.  The keyring_alloc function is called with the KEY_ALLOC_QUOTA_OVERRUN flag, which allows
