 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) due to the lack of error handling for the install_process_keyring_to_cred() function. If this function fails, the code will continue to execute and potentially lead to a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error handling for the install_process_keyring_to_cred() function to prevent potential memory leaks.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the install_process_keyring_to_cred() function. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all possible error scenarios are handled and that the code is robust against potential memory leaks.  ```c
long keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring(int reqkey_defl)
{
	struct cred *new;

	case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING:
		ret = install_process_keyring_to_cred(new);
		if (ret < 0)
			goto error;
		goto set;

	case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT:
	case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING:
```
