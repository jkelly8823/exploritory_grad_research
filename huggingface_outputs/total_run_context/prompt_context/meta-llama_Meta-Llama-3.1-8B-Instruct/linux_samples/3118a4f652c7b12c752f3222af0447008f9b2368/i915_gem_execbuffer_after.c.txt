 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the line where relocs_max is calculated. The INT_MAX constant is divided by the size of the relocation entry struct, which can potentially lead to an integer overflow if the size of the struct is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. This can cause the relocs_max variable to be set to a value that is less than the actual maximum number of relocations, leading to a potential buffer overflow when checking if the relocation count exceeds relocs_max.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer method to calculate relocs_max, such as using a constant that is guaranteed to be large enough to accommodate the maximum number of relocations.
2. Add a check to ensure that the size of the relocation entry struct is not larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer before calculating relocs_max.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the relocations instead of relying on a fixed-size array. This would eliminate the need to worry about integer overflows when calculating the maximum number of relocations. 4. Use a
