 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-7975 vulnerability. This is because the do_remount_sb function is called without checking the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service by making certain unshare system calls and clearing the / MNT_LOCKED flag.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability before calling do_remount_sb.
2. Use the correct capability check function, such as capable() or cap_capable(), to ensure that the capability check is performed correctly.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate function to handle the remounting of the root filesystem, to reduce the attack surface. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-7975
CVE Description:
The do_umount function in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for do_remount_sb calls that change the root filesystem to read-only, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (loss of writability) by making certain unshare system calls, clearing the
