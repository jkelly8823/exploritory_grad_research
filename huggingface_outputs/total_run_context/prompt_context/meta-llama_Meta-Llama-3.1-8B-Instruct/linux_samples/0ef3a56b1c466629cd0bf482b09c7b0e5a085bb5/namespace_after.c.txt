 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-7975 vulnerability. This is because the do_remount_sb function is called without checking the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability when the root filesystem is being remounted to read-only. This allows a local user to cause a denial of service by making certain unshare system calls, clearing the / MNT_LOCKED flag, and making an MNT_FORCE umount system call.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability before calling do_remount_sb when remounting the root filesystem to read-only.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate function to handle remounting the root filesystem to read-only, and requiring the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability for that function. 
3. Review the code to ensure that all other potential vulnerabilities are addressed.  ```
