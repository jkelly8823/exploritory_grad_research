 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2015-1350. The vulnerability is present in the setattr_prepare function. The function does not properly handle the ATTR_KILL_PRIV attribute, which can be used to strip extended privilege attributes from a file. This can lead to a denial of service (capability stripping) when a system call is invoked. The vulnerability is present in lines 5, 7, and 9 of the code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The ATTR_KILL_PRIV attribute should be removed from the setattr_prepare function. This will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.
2. The security_inode_need_killpriv function should be called before setting the ATTR_KILL_PRIV attribute. This will ensure that the attribute is only set if the file has the necessary permissions.
3. The setattr_prepare function should be modified to properly handle the ATTR_KILL_PRIV attribute. This can be done by checking if the file has the necessary permissions before setting the attribute.
