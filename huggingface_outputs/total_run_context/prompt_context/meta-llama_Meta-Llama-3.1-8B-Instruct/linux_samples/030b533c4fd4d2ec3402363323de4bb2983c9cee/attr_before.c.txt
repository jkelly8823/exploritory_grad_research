 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to capability stripping. This is because the setattr_prepare function does not properly validate the ATTR_KILL_PRIV attribute. When ATTR_KILL_PRIV is set, the function clears the attribute from the ia_valid mask, but it does not check if the capability is actually present on the inode. This allows an attacker to remove a capability from the inode, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the capability is present on the inode before clearing it.
2. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a capability mask to track the capabilities of the inode.
3. Review the setattr_prepare function to ensure that it properly handles all possible attribute combinations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-1350
CVE Description:
The VFS subsystem in the Linux kernel 3.x provides an incomplete set of requirements for setattr operations that underspecifies removing extended privilege attributes, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (capability stripping) via a failed invocation of a system call, as demonstrated by using chown to remove a capability from the ping or Wiresh
