 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to a double free vulnerability. The line kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer) is attempting to free memory that has already been freed. This is because the function fail_eps is returning before the memory is freed, causing the memory to be freed twice.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the memory should be freed before the function returns. This can be achieved by moving the kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer) line above the return statement. Additionally, it is recommended to check if the memory is NULL before attempting to free it to prevent potential NULL pointer dereferences. The corrected code should look like this:
if (rsi_dev->tx_buffer) {
	kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer);
}
return status; 
```


VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any instances of the suspected vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure.
