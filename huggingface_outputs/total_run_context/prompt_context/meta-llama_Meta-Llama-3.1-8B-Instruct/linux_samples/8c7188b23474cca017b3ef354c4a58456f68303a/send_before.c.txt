 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) due to a potential race condition when binding a socket. The __rds_conn_create function in net/rds/connection.c in the Linux kernel through 4.2.3 is susceptible to this vulnerability. The code checks if the socket is bound before proceeding, but this check may not be sufficient to prevent a race condition. If another thread binds the socket before the current thread checks, it may lead to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to synchronize access to the socket binding process to prevent race conditions.
2. Check if the socket is bound before proceeding, and if not, wait for the socket to be bound before continuing.
3. Consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or semaphore, to prevent concurrent access to the socket. 
4. Review the code to ensure that all potential race conditions are addressed. 
5. Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism to handle cases where the socket is not bound.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
