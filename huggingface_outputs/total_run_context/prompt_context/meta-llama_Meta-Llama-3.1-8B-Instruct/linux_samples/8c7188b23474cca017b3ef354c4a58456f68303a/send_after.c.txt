 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) due to the lack of a check for a properly bound socket before attempting to access its address. This is a direct match for the CVE-2015-6937 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure the socket is properly bound before accessing its address. This can be done by verifying that the socket's address is not NULL before attempting to access it.
2. Consider using a more specific errno for the ENOTCONN case, as it may not accurately reflect the issue at hand. A more descriptive error message would be beneficial for debugging purposes. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-10033
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.8.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the contents of /proc/<pid>/maps, where <pid> is the process ID of a process running with a different privilege level.

Code Sample:
		struct proc_dir_entry *pde;
		struct mm_struct *mm;
