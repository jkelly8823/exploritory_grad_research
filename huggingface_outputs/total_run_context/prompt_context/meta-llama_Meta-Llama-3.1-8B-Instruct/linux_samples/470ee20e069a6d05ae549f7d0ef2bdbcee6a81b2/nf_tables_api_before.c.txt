VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug due to the possibility of referencing a nft set on a different nft table after that table has been deleted. This occurs when the function nft_set_lookup_byid is called with a set_id that is not the current set_id of the transaction, and the set is not found in the current transaction's set list. In this case, the function will attempt to look up the set on the global nft table, which may have been deleted, leading to a use-after-free bug.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the set_id being looked up is still valid before attempting to look it up on the global nft table.
2. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a hash table, to store the sets in the transaction, to avoid the need to look up sets on the global nft table.
3. Implement a mechanism to notify the caller when a set is deleted, so that they can update their references to the set accordingly. 4. Consider using a lock to protect access to the global nft table, to prevent concurrent modifications that could
