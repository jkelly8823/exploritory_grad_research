 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-26145. The issue arises from the fact that the code accepts second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and processes them as full unfragmented frames. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration. The specific lines of code that are vulnerable are 14-15, where the code checks if the fragment PN is valid and then proceeds to process the fragment. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust check for the fragment PN, such as verifying the PN against a list of expected values or using a more secure method to validate the fragment.
2. Consider disabling the acceptance of second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments in plaintext to prevent this type of attack.
3. Ensure that the code properly handles and discards any invalid or malicious fragments to prevent them from being processed.
