 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-25
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-26145. The issue arises from the fact that the code accepts second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and processes them as full unfragmented frames. This allows an adversary to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration. Specifically, lines 24-25 of the code are vulnerable because they do not properly check for multicast addresses in the fragment headers, which can be exploited to inject arbitrary network packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper multicast address checking in the fragment headers to prevent exploitation.
2. Ensure that the code properly handles and discards fragments with invalid PN or multicast DA to prevent arbitrary network packet injection.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as encryption or authentication, to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
