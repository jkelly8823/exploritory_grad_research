 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be susceptible to the race condition described in CVE-2013-1792. The code snippet checks for the existence of user->uid_keyring and user->session_keyring, but it does not perform any operations that would be vulnerable to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and to consider using synchronization primitives if multiple threads are accessing shared resources. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1792
CVE Description:
Race condition in the install_user_keyrings function in security/keys/process_keys.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via crafted keyctl system calls that trigger keyring operations in simultaneous threads.  The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to this issue.  However, the code does not appear to be checking for the existence of the user->uid_keyring and user->session_keyring before attempting
