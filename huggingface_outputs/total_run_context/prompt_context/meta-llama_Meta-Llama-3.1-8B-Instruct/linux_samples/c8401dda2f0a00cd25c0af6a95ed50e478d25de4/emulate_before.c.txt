 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that processes the trap flag (TF) bit in EFLAGS during emulation of the syscall instruction. The code snippet is related to the em_syscall function, which is not the function that processes the syscall instruction. The syscall instruction is processed in the em_sysenter function, but the code snippet provided does not contain any relevant code for this function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-7518. However, it is recommended to review the code for the em_sysenter function to ensure that it is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7518
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before version 4.12 in the way the KVM module processed the trap flag(TF) bit in EFLAGS during emulation of the syscall instruction, which leads to a debug exception(#DB) being raised in the guest stack. A user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges inside the guest. Linux guests are not affected by this.
