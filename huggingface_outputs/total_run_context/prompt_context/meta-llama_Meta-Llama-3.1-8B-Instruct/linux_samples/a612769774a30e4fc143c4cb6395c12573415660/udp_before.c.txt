 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-6162 because it does not properly handle IPv6 socket operations, which can lead to a denial of service (panic) or unspecified other impact. The vulnerability is present in the line where the udp_csum_pull_header function is called, as it does not properly validate the IPv6 header.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the IPv6 header before calling udp_csum_pull_header.
2. Implement proper error handling to prevent denial of service attacks.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle IPv6 socket operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-6170
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel 4.7-rc6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a crafted UDP packet that triggers an infinite loop in the udp_csum_pull_header function.

Code Sample:

	if (skb->len < 8)
		goto drop;

	udp_csum_pull_header(skb);
	if (skb->len < 8)
		goto drop;
