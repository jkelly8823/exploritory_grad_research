 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2012-4461 vulnerability because it checks if the XSAVE feature is supported by the guest CPU by checking the X86_FEATURE_XSAVE bit in the CPUID leaf 1. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as an attacker can still set the X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit in the guest cr4 register using the KVM_SET_SREGS ioctl, and then call the KVM_RUN ioctl to cause a kernel OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the XSAVE feature is supported by the host CPU as well, and only allow the KVM_RUN ioctl if both the host and guest CPUs support XSAVE. This can be done by checking the X86_FEATURE_XSAVE bit in the CPUID leaf 1 of the host CPU, and then checking if the guest CPU also supports XSAVE. If both checks pass, then the KVM_RUN ioctl can be allowed. Additionally, the code should also check if the X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit is set in the guest cr4 register before allowing the KVM_RUN ioctl.
