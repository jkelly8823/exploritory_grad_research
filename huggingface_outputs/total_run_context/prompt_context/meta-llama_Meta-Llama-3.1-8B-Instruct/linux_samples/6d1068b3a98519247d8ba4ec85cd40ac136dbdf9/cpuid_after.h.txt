 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-4461 because it checks for the presence of XSAVE feature using the static_cpu_has function, which is not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by setting the X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit in the guest cr4 register using the KVM_SET_SREGS ioctl, and then calling the KVM_RUN ioctl. The code does not properly handle this scenario, leading to a kernel OOPS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the kvm_has_xsave function instead of static_cpu_has to check for the presence of XSAVE feature.
2. Add a check to ensure that the X86_CR4_OSXSAVE bit is not set in the guest cr4 register before calling the KVM_RUN ioctl. This can be done by checking the cr4 register value before calling KVM_RUN. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-4461
CVE Description:
The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.6.9, when running on hosts that use qemu userspace without XSAVE, allows local users to cause a denial of service
