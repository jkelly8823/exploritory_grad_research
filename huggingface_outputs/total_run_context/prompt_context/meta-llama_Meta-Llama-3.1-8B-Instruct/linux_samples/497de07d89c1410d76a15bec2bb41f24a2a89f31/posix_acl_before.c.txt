 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7097 vulnerability because it preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call. This is evident in the line where the error is checked and the acl is set to NULL if the error is 0. This allows a local user to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the error code and handle it properly to prevent the setgid bit from being preserved.
2. Use the correct function to set the ACL, which should not preserve the setgid bit.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle ACLs, such as using a library that provides secure ACL handling.
