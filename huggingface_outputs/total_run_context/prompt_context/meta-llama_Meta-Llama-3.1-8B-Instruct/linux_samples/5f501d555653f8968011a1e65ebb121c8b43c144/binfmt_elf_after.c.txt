 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a kernel vulnerability that was fixed in April 2015. The vulnerability is related to the way the kernel handles the mapping of ELF binaries. Specifically, the code does not take into account the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary, which can lead to a situation where the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below the mm->mmap_base, while the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base. This can cause the kernel to attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base, which can lead to a security threat.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to take into account the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary. This can be done by checking the size of the ELF mapping and ensuring that it is sufficient to accommodate all the segments. Additionally, the code should be modified to use MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE consistently, rather than switching between MAP_FIXED and MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE based on the type of ELF binary. This will ensure that the kernel always maps the ELF binary into a consistent address range,
