 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Spectre variant 2 attack with indirect branches due to the presence of the X86_BUG_SPECTRE_V2 macro. This macro is used to indicate that the CPU is affected by the Spectre variant 2 attack with indirect branches.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the CPU microcode to the latest version to mitigate the Spectre variant 2 attack.
2. Use indirect branch prediction barriers (IBPB) to prevent the attack.
3. Use a compiler that supports Spectre mitigation, such as GCC 8.1 or later.
