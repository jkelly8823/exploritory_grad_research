 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11479 because the TCP minimum segment size (MSS) is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. The vulnerability is present in the line where the `tcp_min_snd_mss_min` variable is initialized with the value of `TCP_MIN_SND_MSS`, which is 48 bytes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2019-11479, which is available in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and in commits 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6 and 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363.
2. Alternatively, you can modify the code to dynamically calculate the TCP minimum segment size (MSS) based on
