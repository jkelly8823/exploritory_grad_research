 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11479 because it does not account for SACKs when calculating the MSS. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. The code is also vulnerable because it uses a hard-coded value of 48 bytes for the MSS, which can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to account for SACKs when calculating the MSS.
2. Use a more secure method to calculate the MSS, such as using the TCP_MAXSEG option.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle TCP options, such as using the TCP_OPTIONS option. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-11479
CVE Description:
Jonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.
