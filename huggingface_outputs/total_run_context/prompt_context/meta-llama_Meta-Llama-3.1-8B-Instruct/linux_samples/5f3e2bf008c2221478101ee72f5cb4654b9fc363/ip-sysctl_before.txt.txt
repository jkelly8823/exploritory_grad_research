 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The code snippet appears to be a configuration section for a network stack, and it does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the TCP MSS hard-coding vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11479.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the kernel version is up-to-date to prevent any potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-11479
CVE Description:
Jonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commits 967c05aee439e6e5
