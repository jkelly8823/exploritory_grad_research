 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a vulnerability related to the Path MTU discovery (MTU probing) mechanism. The initial MSS (Maximum Segment Size) used by the connection is hardcoded to 48 bytes, which can be exploited by a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues and cause a denial of service. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-11479) that has been fixed in certain kernel releases.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2019-11479 (e.g., kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11).
2. Apply the patches (commits 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6 and 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363) to the kernel source code.
3. Consider increasing the initial MSS value to a larger size to mitigate the vulnerability. However, this
