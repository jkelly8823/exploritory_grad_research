 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-11479. The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's default TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) being hard-coded to 48 bytes, which allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues. However, the code sample provided does not contain any code related to TCP MSS settings. It appears to be a configuration file for sysctl variables, which are used to control various kernel parameters.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-11479. However, it is recommended to ensure that the kernel is up-to-date and patched to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to review the sysctl configuration to ensure that it is secure and does not contain any other potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-11479
CVE Description:
Jonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial
