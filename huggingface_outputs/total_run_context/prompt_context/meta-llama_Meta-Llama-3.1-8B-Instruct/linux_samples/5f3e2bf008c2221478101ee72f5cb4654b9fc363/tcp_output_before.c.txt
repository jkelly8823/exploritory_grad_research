 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2019-11479 vulnerability. The code snippet is calculating the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) for a TCP connection, but it does not appear to be using the default MSS value of 48 bytes. Instead, it is calculating the MSS based on the icsk->icsk_ext_hdr_len and TCP_MIN_SND_MSS values. This suggests that the code is using a more secure and dynamic approach to calculating the MSS, rather than relying on a hard-coded value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the CVE-2019-11479 vulnerability. However, it may be beneficial to review the code to ensure that it is correctly handling SACKs (Selective Acknowledgment) and other TCP options. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000001
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's TCP implementation allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted TCP packet. The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation of the
