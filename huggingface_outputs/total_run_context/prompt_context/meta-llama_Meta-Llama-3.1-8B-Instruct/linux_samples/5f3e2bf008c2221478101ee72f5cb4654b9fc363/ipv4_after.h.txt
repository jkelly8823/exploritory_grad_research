 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel's default MSS being hard-coded to 48 bytes, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a snippet of system call table definitions, which does not relate to the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to ensure that the system is running a kernel version that has been patched for this vulnerability. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly update the kernel to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-11479
CVE Description:
Jonathan Looney discovered that the Linux kernel default MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes. This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127,
