 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. In the first function, the snd_soc_card_get_codec_dai function returns a NULL pointer, which is then dereferenced in the snd_soc_component_set_jack function. In the second function, the snd_soc_card_get_codec_dai function returns a valid pointer, but the snd_soc_component_set_jack function is called with a NULL pointer for the second argument. This is a classic example of CWE-476, where a function expects a valid pointer but receives a NULL pointer instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of snd_soc_card_get_codec_dai to ensure it is not NULL before dereferencing it.
2. Pass a valid pointer to snd_soc_component_set_jack instead of NULL. 
3. Consider adding error handling to handle the case where snd_soc_card_get_codec_dai returns NULL.

CWE_ID:476
CWE Description:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.  CWE-476 is a classic example of a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when a function
