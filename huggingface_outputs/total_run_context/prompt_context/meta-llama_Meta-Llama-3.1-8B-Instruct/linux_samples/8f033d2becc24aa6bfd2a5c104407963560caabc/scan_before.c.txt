VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c. This is due to the lack of validation of the length of the sub-element's data. The sub-element's data is accessed without checking if it's within the bounds of the elem->datalen, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the length of the sub-element's data before accessing it. This can be done by checking if sub->datalen is greater than or equal to 4 before accessing sub->data.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated buffer, to store the sub-element's data. This can help prevent buffer overflows and make the code more secure. 
3. Implement a bounds checking mechanism to ensure that the sub-element's data is within the bounds of the elem->datalen. This can be done by using a loop to iterate over the sub-element's data and checking if each element is within the bounds of the elem->datalen. 4. Consider using a safer function, such as memcpy_s, to copy the sub
