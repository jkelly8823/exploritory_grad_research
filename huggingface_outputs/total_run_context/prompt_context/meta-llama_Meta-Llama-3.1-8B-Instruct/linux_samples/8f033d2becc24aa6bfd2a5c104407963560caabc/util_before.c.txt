 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c. This is due to the lack of bounds checking on the datalen field of the elem structure. An attacker could inject WLAN frames with a large datalen value, causing a buffer overflow when the elem->data array is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on the datalen field of the elem structure to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the elem->data array.
3. Consider using a more secure function, such as memcpy_s, to copy data into the elem->data array. 
4. Review the code for any other potential vulnerabilities and address them accordingly.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-41674
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c.  VULNERABLE:
