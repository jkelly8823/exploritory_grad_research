 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c. This is due to the lack of bounds checking on the elem->datalen variable, which can lead to a buffer overflow when processing WLAN frames.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on the elem->datalen variable to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed value.
2. Use a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the WLAN frames.
3. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent buffer overflows in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2022-41674
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in net/mac80211/scan.c.  This vulnerability is a result of a lack of bounds checking on the elem->datalen variable.  The code provided does not appear to be the exact location of the vulnerability,
