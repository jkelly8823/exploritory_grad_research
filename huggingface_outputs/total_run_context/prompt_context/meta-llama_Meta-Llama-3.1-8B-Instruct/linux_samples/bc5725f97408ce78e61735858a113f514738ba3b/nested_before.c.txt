 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-3887 because it does not properly handle x2APIC MSR access with nested virtualization enabled. The code allows a guest to access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, which can lead to a potential crash of the host kernel resulting in a DoS issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel version to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (version 4.16 and newer).
2. Implement proper handling for x2APIC MSR access with nested virtualization enabled.
3. Use a secure method to access L0's APIC register values, such as using a secure API or function. 
4. Review and update the code to ensure that it properly handles MSR access and virtualization. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3887
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific Rregister (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest could access L0's APIC register values via L2
