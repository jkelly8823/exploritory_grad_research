 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (data loss) due to the potential for filesystem write operations on a read-only disk that supports the BLKIF_OP_DISCARD or SCSI UNMAP feature. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where the discard operation fails, leading to potential data loss.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add error handling for the discard operation to prevent data loss in case of failure.
2. Check if the disk supports the discard feature before attempting to use it.
3. Consider using a more robust method for handling discard operations, such as using a retry mechanism or a fallback to a different method. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2140
CVE Description:
The dispatch_discard_io function in drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c in the Xen blkback implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.10.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (data loss) via filesystem write operations on a read-only disk that supports the (1) BLKIF_OP_DISCARD (aka discard or TRIM) or (2)
