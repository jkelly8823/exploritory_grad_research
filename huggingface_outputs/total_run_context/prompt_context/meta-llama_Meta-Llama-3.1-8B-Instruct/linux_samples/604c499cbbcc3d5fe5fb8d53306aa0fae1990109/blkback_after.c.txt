 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (data loss) due to the potential for filesystem write operations on a read-only disk that supports the BLKIF_OP_DISCARD feature. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where the disk does not support discard operations, leading to potential data loss.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the disk supports discard operations before attempting to perform a discard operation.
2. Handle the case where the disk does not support discard operations by returning an error code instead of attempting to perform the operation.
3. Consider adding additional error handling to ensure that the system can recover from potential data loss scenarios. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2140
CVE Description:
The dispatch_discard_io function in drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c in the Xen blkback implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.10.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (data loss) via filesystem write operations on a read-only disk that supports the (1) BLKIF_OP_DISCARD (aka discard or TRIM)
