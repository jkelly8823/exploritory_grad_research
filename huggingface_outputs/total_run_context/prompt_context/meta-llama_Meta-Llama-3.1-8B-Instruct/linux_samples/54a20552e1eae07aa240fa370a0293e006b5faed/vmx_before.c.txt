 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2015-5307 vulnerability because it allows guest OS users to trigger many #AC (aka Alignment Check) exceptions. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle the exceptions, leading to a denial of service (host OS panic or hang).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper exception handling to prevent the guest OS from triggering many #AC exceptions.
2. Use a more robust method to handle the exceptions, such as using a try-catch block or a separate function to handle the exceptions.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the exceptions, such as using a hardware-based exception handling mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
