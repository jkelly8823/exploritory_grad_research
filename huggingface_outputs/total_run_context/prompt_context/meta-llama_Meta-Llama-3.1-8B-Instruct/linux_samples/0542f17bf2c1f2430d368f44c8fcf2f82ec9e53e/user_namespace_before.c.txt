VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 issue because it does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships. The condition (new_map->nr_extents == 1) && (new_map->extent[0].count == 1) allows mapping to your own filesystem ids, which can be exploited by local users to bypass intended file permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper checks to ensure that the new_map->nr_extents and new_map->extent[0].count are not equal to 1 before allowing the mapping.
2.  Verify that the new_map->extent[0].lower_first is not equal to the current user's id before making the kuid_t uid.
3.  Consider using a more secure method to handle the uid and gid mappings, such as using a secure hash function to generate the uid and gid values.
