 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-8989 issue. The condition in the if statement checks if the new_map has only one extent with a count of 1, which is a valid condition for a single user ID mapping. However, the subsequent check for CAP_SETUID and the creation of a kuid_t object using make_kuid() function can be exploited to bypass intended file permissions. This is because the make_kuid() function does not properly restrict dropping of supplemental group memberships in certain namespace scenarios.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Add a check to ensure that the new_map has more than one extent or the count is greater than 1 before creating the kuid_t object.
2.  Use the ns->parent->user_ns->gid_validity to validate the group memberships before creating the kuid_t object.
3.  Consider using the kuid_from_kgid() function to create the kuid_t object, which takes into account the group memberships and namespace validity. 
4.  Review and update the kernel/groups.c, kernel/uid16.c, and kernel/user_namespace.c files to ensure that they properly restrict
