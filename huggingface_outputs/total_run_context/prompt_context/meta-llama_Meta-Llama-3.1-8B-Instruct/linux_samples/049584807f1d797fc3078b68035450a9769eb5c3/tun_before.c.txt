 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2024-41091 vulnerability because it does not check the validity of the frame length in the tun_xdp_one() path. The variable skb_xdp is set to true when gso->gso_type is true, but it does not verify if the frame length is valid before setting skb_xdp to true. This could cause a corrupted skb to be sent downstack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to verify the frame length before setting skb_xdp to true.
2. Use the tun_get_user() function to prohibit short frames with length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2024-41092
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tun: fix potential use-after-free in tun_xdp_one()

The fix for CVE-2024-41091 missed to check for the case where the
tun->xdp_prog is NULL, which could lead to a use-after-free bug when
tun_xdp_one() is called.
