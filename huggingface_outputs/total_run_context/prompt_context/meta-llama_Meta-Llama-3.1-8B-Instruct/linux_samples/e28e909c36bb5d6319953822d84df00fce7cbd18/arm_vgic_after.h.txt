 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440 because it mishandles the APICv on/off state. This allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly handle the APICv on/off state.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent guest OS users from obtaining direct APIC MSR access.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling APIC MSR access, such as using a secure API.
