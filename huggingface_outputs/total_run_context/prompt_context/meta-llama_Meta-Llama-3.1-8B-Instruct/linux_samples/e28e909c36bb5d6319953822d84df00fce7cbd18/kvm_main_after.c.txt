 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode. This is due to the mishandling of the APICv on/off state in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file of the Linux kernel through 4.6.3.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g., 4.6.4 or later).
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2016-4440 to the affected kernel version.
3. Consider disabling x2APIC mode if it is not necessary for your use case.
4. Regularly update and patch your kernel to prevent similar vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-4440
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv on/off state, which allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash)
