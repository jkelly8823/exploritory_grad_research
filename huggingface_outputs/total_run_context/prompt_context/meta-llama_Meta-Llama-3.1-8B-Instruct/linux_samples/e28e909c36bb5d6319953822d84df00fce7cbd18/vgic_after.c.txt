 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440. This vulnerability is due to the mishandling of the APICv on/off state in the Linux kernel. The code allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, which can cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix for this vulnerability is to properly handle the APICv on/off state in the Linux kernel. This can be achieved by implementing the necessary checks and restrictions to prevent guest OS users from obtaining direct APIC MSR access on the host OS. Additionally, it is recommended to update the kernel to the latest version to ensure that the vulnerability is patched.
