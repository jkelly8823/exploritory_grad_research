VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000253
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a crafted application that leverages the fact that the __fget_raw function does not check for an empty path.

Code Sample:
	struct file *file;
	struct path path;
	struct file *f;

	path = kern_path_create(path, LOOKUP_FOLLOW);
	if (IS_ERR(path))
		return path;
	file = fget_raw(path.dentry, fmode);
	if
