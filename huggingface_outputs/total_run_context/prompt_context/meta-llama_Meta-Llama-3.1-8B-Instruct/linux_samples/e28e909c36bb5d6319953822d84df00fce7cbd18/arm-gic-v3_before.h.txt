 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of the APICv on/off state handling, which is the root cause of the CVE-2016-4440 vulnerability. The code defines various constants for ICH (Intel 82801) MSR (Model-Specific Register) access, but it does not contain any code that would allow guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerable code. However, it is essential to ensure that any code that handles APICv on/off state is properly implemented and tested to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  The code should be reviewed for any potential issues related to MSR access and APIC handling. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-4440
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv on/off state, which allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS
