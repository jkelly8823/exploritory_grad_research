 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode. This is due to the mishandling of the APICv on/off state in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3. The code is accessing the APIC MSR directly, which can be exploited by a guest OS user to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code on the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue (e.g. 4.6.4 or later).
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent guest OS users from accessing the APIC MSR directly.
3. Consider using a different method to handle the APICv on/off state, such as using a software-based solution instead of relying on the hardware.

CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv on/off state, which allows
