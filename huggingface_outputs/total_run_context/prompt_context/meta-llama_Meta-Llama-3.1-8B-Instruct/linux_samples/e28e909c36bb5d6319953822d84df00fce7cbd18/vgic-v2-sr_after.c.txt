 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440 because it mishandles the APICv on/off state, allowing guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS. This can cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.6.4 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Apply the patch for CVE-2016-4440 to the Linux kernel source code.
3. Ensure that the KVM module is properly configured and updated to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. 
4. Consider disabling x2APIC mode in the guest OS to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. 
5. Regularly update and patch the Linux kernel to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. 
6. Implement additional security measures, such as address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP), to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. 
7. Consider using a secure virtualization platform, such as KVM with the latest security patches, to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability
