 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440 because it mishandles the APICv on/off state. The APICv on/off state is not properly checked, allowing a guest OS user to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS. This can cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the APICv on/off state before accessing the APIC MSR.
2. Use a secure method to access the APIC MSR, such as using a kernel module.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent guest OS users from accessing the APIC MSR.  ```bash
#define TSC_RATIO_MIN		0x0000000000000001ULL
#define TSC_RATIO_MAX		0x000000ffffffffffULL

#define AVIC_HPA_MASK	~((0xFFFULL << 52) || 0xFFF)

/*
 * 0xff is broadcast, so the max index allowed for physical APIC ID
 * table is 0xfe.  APIC IDs above 0xff are reserved.
