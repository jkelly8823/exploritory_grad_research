 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440 because it mishandles the APICv on/off state. This allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode. The vulnerability is present in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file of the Linux kernel through 4.6.3.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version greater than 4.6.3 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper handling of the APICv on/off state to prevent guest OS users from obtaining direct APIC MSR access on the host OS. 
3. Use a secure method to access the APIC MSR, such as using a secure API or a hardware-based solution. 
4. Regularly update and patch the Linux kernel to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
