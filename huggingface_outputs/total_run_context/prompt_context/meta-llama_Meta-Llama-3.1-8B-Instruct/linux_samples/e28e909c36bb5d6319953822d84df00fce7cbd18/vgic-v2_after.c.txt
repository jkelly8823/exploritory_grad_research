 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode. This is due to the mishandling of the APICv on/off state in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3. The vulnerability is present in the vgic_cpu_init_lrs function, where the vgic structure is not properly initialized, leading to potential access to direct APIC MSR.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly initialize the vgic structure to prevent access to direct APIC MSR.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure the APICv on/off state is handled correctly.
3. Update the Linux kernel to a version that addresses this vulnerability (e.g., 4.7 or later). 
4. Consider using a secure alternative to x2APIC mode. 
5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
