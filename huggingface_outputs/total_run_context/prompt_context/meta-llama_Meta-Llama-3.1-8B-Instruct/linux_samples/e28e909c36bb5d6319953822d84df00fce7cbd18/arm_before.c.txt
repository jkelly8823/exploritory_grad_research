 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode. This is due to the mishandling of the APICv on/off state in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3. The code does not properly handle the APICv state, allowing a guest OS user to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that properly handles the APICv on/off state.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the APICv state is properly handled before allowing guest OS access to the APIC MSR.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling the APICv state, such as using a separate data structure to track the state of each APIC MSR.

CVE Description:
