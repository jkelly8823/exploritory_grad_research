 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440 due to the mishandling of the APICv on/off state. This allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution on the host OS. The vulnerability is present in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file of the Linux kernel through version 4.6.3.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version greater than 4.6.3 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional security measures to prevent guest OS users from accessing the host OS's APIC MSR. This may involve modifying the KVM code to properly handle the APICv on/off state. 
3. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
