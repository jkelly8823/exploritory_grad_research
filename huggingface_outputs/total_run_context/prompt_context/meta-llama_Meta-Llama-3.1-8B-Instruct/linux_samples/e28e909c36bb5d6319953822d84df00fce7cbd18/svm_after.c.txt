 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-4440 because it mishandles the APICv on/off state. The APICv on/off state is not properly checked, allowing a guest OS user to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS. This can cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the APICv on/off state before accessing the APIC MSR.
2. Use a secure method to handle the APIC MSR access, such as using a secure API.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent guest OS users from obtaining direct APIC MSR access. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-4440
CVE Description:
arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv on/off state, which allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode
