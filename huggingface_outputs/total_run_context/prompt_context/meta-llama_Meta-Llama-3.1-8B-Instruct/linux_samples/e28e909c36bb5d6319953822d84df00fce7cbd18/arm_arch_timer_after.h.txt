 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to APICv on/off state handling, nor does it contain any code that could potentially lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution on the host OS. The code appears to be related to the architecture of the timer in the Linux kernel, specifically for KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) support.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the described CVE. However, it is essential to note that the code may still contain other vulnerabilities or security issues that are not related to this specific CVE. A thorough code review is recommended to ensure the overall security of the code.  VULNERABILITY LIST: CVE_ID:CVE-2016-4440, CVE Description:arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 mishandles the APICv on/off state, which allows guest OS users to obtain direct APIC MSR access on the host OS, and consequently cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS, via x2APIC mode.
