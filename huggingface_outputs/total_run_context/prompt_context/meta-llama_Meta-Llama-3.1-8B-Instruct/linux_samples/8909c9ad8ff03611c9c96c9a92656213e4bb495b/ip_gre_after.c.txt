 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain the dev_load function, which is the specific function that allows for the bypass of the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability requirement. The code does contain module aliases, but these are not related to the dev_load function or the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1019.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain the vulnerable function and does not pose a risk for this specific vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and validate the code for other potential vulnerabilities.  The code should be reviewed for any other potential security issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000114
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.13.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the netdev watchdog, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition between netdev watchdog and rtnl-link-set operations.

Code Sample:
struct net_device *netdev = NULL;
struct rtnl_link_stats *stats = NULL;
struct net_device_stats *dev_stats = NULL;

if (netdev!= NULL)
