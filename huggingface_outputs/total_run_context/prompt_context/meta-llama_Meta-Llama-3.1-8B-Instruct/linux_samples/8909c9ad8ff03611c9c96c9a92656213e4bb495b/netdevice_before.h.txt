 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1019 vulnerability because it allows the dev_load function to be bypassed, which can lead to arbitrary module loading. This is due to the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability being used instead of the intended CAP_SYS_MODULE capability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability and use the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability instead.
- Review and update the code to ensure that it adheres to the intended security requirements. 
- Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent arbitrary module loading.  ```
