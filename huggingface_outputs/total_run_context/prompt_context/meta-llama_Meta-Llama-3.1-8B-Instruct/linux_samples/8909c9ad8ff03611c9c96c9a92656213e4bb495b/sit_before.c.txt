 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1019 vulnerability because it does not check the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability before loading the module. This allows an attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to load arbitrary modules.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a capability check before loading the module: 
   if (!capable(CAP_SYS_MODULE))
   {
       printk(KERN_ERR "sit: CAP_SYS_MODULE required\n");
       return -EPERM;
   }
2. Use the kernel's built-in capability system to restrict module loading to only those with the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability. This can be done by adding the following line to the module's Makefile:
   EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DCAP_SYS_MODULE_REQUIRED
3. Consider using the kernel's module signing feature to ensure that only trusted modules can be loaded. This can be done by adding the following line to the module's Makefile:
   EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DMODULE_SIG_REQUIRED
4. Review the module's code to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities.
