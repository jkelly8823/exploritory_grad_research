 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1019 vulnerability because it uses the MODULE_LICENSE macro without checking the capability of the user. This allows an attacker to load arbitrary modules by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a capability check before loading the module to ensure that the user has the required capability.
2. Use the kernel's built-in capability system to restrict module loading to authorized users.
3. Consider using a secure module loading mechanism, such as the one provided by the kernel's module loader. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000114
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.12.3 has a use-after-free vulnerability in the netdev watchdog code, where a netdev is freed while still being referenced by the watchdog.

Code Sample:
struct net_device *netdev;
struct netdev_watchdog *watchdog;

netdev = dev_get_by_name(&init_net, "eth0");
if (netdev) {
    watchdog = kmalloc(sizeof(*watchdog), GFP_KERNEL);
    if (watchdog) {
        netdev_watchdog
