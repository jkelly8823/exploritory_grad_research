 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1019 vulnerability. The dev_load function does not properly check for the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability before loading a kernel module. This allows an attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to bypass the intended CAP_SYS_MODULE capability requirement and load arbitrary modules.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the CAP_SYS_MODULE check and only use the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to load kernel modules.
2. Update the code to use the netdev-%s alias for loading kernel modules with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
3. Consider using a more secure method to load kernel modules, such as using a whitelist of allowed modules. 
4. Update the code to handle the case where the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability is not present, and do not attempt to load the kernel module in this case. 
5. Consider adding additional checks and validation to ensure that the kernel module being loaded is safe and does not pose a security risk.  ```bash
