 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2011-1019 vulnerability because it does not check for the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability before loading the module. This allows an attacker with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to load arbitrary modules, bypassing the intended security restriction.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a capability check before loading the module: 
   if (!capable(CAP_SYS_MODULE))
   {
       printk(KERN_ERR "sit: CAP_SYS_MODULE required\n");
       return -EPERM;
   }
2. Use the kernel's built-in capability system to restrict module loading to only those with the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability. This can be done by adding the following line to the module's Makefile:
   EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DCAP_SYS_MODULE_REQUIRED
3. Consider using a more secure module loading mechanism, such as the kernel's built-in module signing and verification system. This would require the module to be signed with a trusted key and verified by the kernel before loading.
