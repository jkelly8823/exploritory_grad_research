 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) due to a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode. This is because the recalculate_apic_map function does not properly handle the ICR write operation, allowing a guest OS user to cause a host OS crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation and sanitization of the ICR write operation in the recalculate_apic_map function.
2. Consider adding additional checks to prevent a guest OS user from causing a host OS crash.
3. Review and update the recalculate_apic_map function to ensure it properly handles the ICR write operation in x2apic mode. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-6376
CVE Description:
The recalculate_apic_map function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.12.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode.  VULNERABLE: YES
