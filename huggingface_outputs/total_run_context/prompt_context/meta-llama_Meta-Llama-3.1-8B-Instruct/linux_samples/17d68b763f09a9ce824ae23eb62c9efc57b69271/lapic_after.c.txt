 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) due to a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode. This is because the recalculate_apic_map function does not properly handle the ICR write operation, allowing a guest OS user to cause a host OS crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation for the ICR write operation in x2apic mode.
2. Add checks to ensure that the guest OS user does not attempt to write to the ICR register in x2apic mode.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate register for the ICR write operation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-6376
CVE Description:
The recalculate_apic_map function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.12.5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted ICR write operation in x2apic mode.  Line 14-15 are the lines that are vulnerable to this issue.
