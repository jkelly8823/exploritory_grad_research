 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3653 because it does not properly validate the "int_ctl" field in the VMCB. This allows a malicious L1 guest to enable AVIC support for the L2 guest, resulting in a potential guest-to-host escape.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "int_ctl" field in the VMCB to ensure it does not contain any malicious values.
2. Use a secure method to handle the "int_ctl" field, such as using a whitelist of allowed values.
3. Consider using a more secure virtualization mechanism to prevent this type of vulnerability.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-3653
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "int_ctl" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L
