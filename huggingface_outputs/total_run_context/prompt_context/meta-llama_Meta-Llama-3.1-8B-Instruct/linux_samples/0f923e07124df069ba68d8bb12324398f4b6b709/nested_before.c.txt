VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3653 because it does not properly validate the "int_ctl" field in the VMCB. The line svm->vmcb->control.int_ctl = (svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl & ~mask) | (svm->vmcb01.ptr->control.int_ctl & mask); does not check if the "int_ctl" field is within the valid range, which allows a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support for the L2 guest.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the "int_ctl" field is within the valid range before setting it in the VMCB.
2. Use a secure method to validate the "int_ctl" field, such as using a whitelist of allowed values. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the "int_ctl" field, such as using a separate data structure to store the allowed values. 
4. Review the code to ensure that all fields in the VMCB are properly validated.  ```bash
