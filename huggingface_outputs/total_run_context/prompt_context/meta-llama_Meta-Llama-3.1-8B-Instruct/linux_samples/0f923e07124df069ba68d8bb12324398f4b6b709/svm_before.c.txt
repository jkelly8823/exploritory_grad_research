 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3653 because it does not properly validate the "int_ctl" field when processing the VMCB provided by the L1 guest. This allows a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support for the L2 guest, resulting in a potential guest-to-host escape.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "int_ctl" field properly before processing the VMCB.
2. Use a secure method to handle the "int_ctl" field, such as using a whitelist of allowed values.
3. Consider using a more secure virtualization mechanism to prevent this type of vulnerability.  ```bash
