 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) due to the request_key system call for the "dead" type. This is because the keyring_search_aux function in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.79 allows local users to cause a denial of service via a request_key system call for the "dead" type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using the "dead" type in the request_key system call.
2. Implement proper error handling to prevent NULL pointer dereferences.
3. Consider upgrading the Linux kernel to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue.
