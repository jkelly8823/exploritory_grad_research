 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-5195 and CVE-2022-2590 vulnerabilities due to the presence of a race condition in the copy-on-write (COW) feature. The can_follow_write_pte function checks if a page can be written to, but it does not properly handle the case where a page is shared between multiple processes. This allows an attacker to write to a read-only memory mapping, increasing their privileges on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that has fixed the CVE-2016-5195 and CVE-2022-2590 vulnerabilities.
2. Implement proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions in the COW feature.
3. Use a more secure approach to handle shared memory mappings, such as using a separate data structure to track shared pages. 
4. Consider using a more secure memory management system, such as a memory-safe language or a hypervisor. 
5. Regularly review and update the kernel to ensure that it remains secure.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
