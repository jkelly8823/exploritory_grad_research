 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) and CVE-2022-2590 vulnerabilities due to the presence of a race condition in the copy-on-write (COW) feature. The can_follow_write_pte function checks if a page can be written to, but it does not properly handle the case where the page is dirty and the FOLL_FORCE flag is set. This allows an attacker to write to a read-only memory mapping, increasing their privileges on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the can_follow_write_pte function to properly handle the case where the page is dirty and the FOLL_FORCE flag is set.
2. Add additional checks to ensure that the page is not dirty before allowing write access.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate data structure to track dirty pages, to avoid the race condition.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2022-2590 vulnerability, as it does not contain the specific code that was identified
