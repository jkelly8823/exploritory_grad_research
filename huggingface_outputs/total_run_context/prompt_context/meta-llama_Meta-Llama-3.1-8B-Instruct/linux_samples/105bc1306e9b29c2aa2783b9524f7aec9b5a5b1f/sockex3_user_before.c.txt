RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code for other potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that it is properly tested and validated. Additionally, the use of sleep(1) in a loop may indicate a performance issue and should be reviewed.  The use of printf in a loop may also indicate a performance issue and should be reviewed.  It is also recommended to consider using a more modern and efficient way to print the output, such as using a logging framework.  The code also does not handle any potential errors that may occur when accessing the prog_fd and map_fd file descriptors. It is recommended to add error handling code to handle these potential errors.  The code also does not check if the prog_fd and map_fd file descriptors are
