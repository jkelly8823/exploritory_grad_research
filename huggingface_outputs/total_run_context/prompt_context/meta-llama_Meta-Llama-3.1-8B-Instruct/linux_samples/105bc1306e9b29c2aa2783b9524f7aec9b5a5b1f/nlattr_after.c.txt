 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite loop) due to a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation. This is because the skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 does not properly handle such cases. The vulnerability is related to the IHL field, which is not properly validated in the nla_next function. This function is called in the nla_parse function, which is used to parse netlink attributes. The nla_next function is responsible for advancing the pointer to the next attribute, but it does not check if the current attribute is valid. This can lead to an infinite loop if the IHL field is small.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the IHL field in the nla_next function to prevent infinite loops.
2. Use a more robust validation mechanism to ensure that the IHL field is within the valid range.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a linked list, to store the netlink attributes. This would allow for more efficient and secure parsing of the attributes.
