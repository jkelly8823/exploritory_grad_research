CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4348
CVE Description:
The skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation.  Code Sample:
int skb_flow_dissect(struct sk_buff *skb, struct flow_dissector *flow,
			struct flow_keys *flow_keys, u8 *flow_cls_id)
{
