 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite loop) due to the skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12. This is because the code does not properly handle a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation, which can cause the skb_flow_dissect function to enter an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version greater than 3.12 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement proper error handling for the skb_flow_dissect function to prevent infinite loops.
3. Use a secure method to handle packets with IPIP encapsulation, such as using a packet filter to discard packets with invalid IHL values. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4348
CVE Description:
The skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation.
