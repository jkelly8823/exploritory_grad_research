 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite loop) via a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation. This is due to the skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version greater than 3.12 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the IHL field value is within a valid range to prevent the infinite loop.
3. Consider using a more secure function to handle packet dissection, such as one that uses a more robust algorithm or is less prone to infinite loops. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4348
CVE Description:
The skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation.  The vulnerability is due to the fact that the function does not properly handle packets with IPIP
