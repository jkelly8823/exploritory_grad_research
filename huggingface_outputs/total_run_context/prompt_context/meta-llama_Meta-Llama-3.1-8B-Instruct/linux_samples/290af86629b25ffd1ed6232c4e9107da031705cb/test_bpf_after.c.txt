 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a side-channel analysis attack due to the use of speculative execution and indirect branch prediction. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-5715) that can allow an attacker with local user access to disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the microprocessor to a version that is not vulnerable to this attack.
2. Implement a software-based mitigation, such as reordering the code to reduce the effectiveness of the attack.
3. Use a secure programming language that is not vulnerable to this attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.  The code sample provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to this CVE. However, the code does contain a potential vulnerability related to the use of the `pr_cont` function. The `pr_cont` function is used to print a message to the console, but it does not properly handle the case where the message is too long. This can lead to a buffer overflow
