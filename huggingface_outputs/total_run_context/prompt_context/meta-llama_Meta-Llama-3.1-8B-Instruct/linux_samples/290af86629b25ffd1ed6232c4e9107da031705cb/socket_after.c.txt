 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a side-channel attack due to the speculative execution and indirect branch prediction in the microprocessor. This is a known issue in systems that use speculative execution, and it can be exploited by an attacker with local user access. The code is using indirect branch prediction, which can be used to extract information from the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Disable speculative execution in the microprocessor.
2. Use a different method for indirect branch prediction.
3. Implement a mitigation technique, such as retpoline, to prevent the attack.
4. Update the microprocessor to a version that is not vulnerable to this attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.  This vulnerability is related to the Spectre attack.  The Spectre attack is a type of side-channel attack that exploits the speculative execution of the CPU.  The attack works by tricking the CPU into speculatively executing code that would normally be protected by a
