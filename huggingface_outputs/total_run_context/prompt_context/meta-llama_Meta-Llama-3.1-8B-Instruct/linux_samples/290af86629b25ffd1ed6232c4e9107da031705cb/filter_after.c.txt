 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a speculative execution attack due to the use of indirect branch prediction. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a label, which can be predicted by an attacker using side-channel analysis. This allows an attacker with local user access to potentially disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the `goto` statement with a direct branch instruction, such as a `return` statement.
2. Consider using a compiler flag or optimization to disable speculative execution.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as branch prediction randomization, to mitigate the attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.  CVE_ID:CVE-2019-1125
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) in the way it handled the BPF_PROG_ATTACH type. This flaw allows an attacker to attach a BPF program to the socket in a way that
