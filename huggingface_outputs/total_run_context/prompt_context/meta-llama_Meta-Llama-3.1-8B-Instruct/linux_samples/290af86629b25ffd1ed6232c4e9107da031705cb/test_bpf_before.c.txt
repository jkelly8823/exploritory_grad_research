 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a side-channel attack due to the use of speculative execution and indirect branch prediction. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2017-5715) that can allow an attacker with local user access to disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the microprocessor to a version that is not vulnerable to this issue.
2. Use a software-based solution, such as a compiler flag or a library, to mitigate the vulnerability.
3. Implement a hardware-based solution, such as a microcode update, to fix the issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-5715
CVE Description:
Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.  The code is vulnerable to this issue due to the use of speculative execution and indirect branch prediction.  The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating the microprocessor or using a software-based solution.  The code does not contain any obvious fixes for this issue, but it can be mitigated by implementing a hardware-based solution or using a software-based solution.
