 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (system crash) due to the mishandling of the case of four page-table levels in the fork implementation. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel before 4.5 on s390 platforms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.5 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to handle the case of four page-table levels correctly.
3. Consider using a different fork implementation that does not have this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-2143
CVE Description:
The fork implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.5 on s390 platforms mishandles the case of four page-table levels, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to arch/s390/include/asm/mmu_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h.
