 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to information leakage due to an integer signedness error in the sbusfb_ioctl_helper() function. The issue arises from the use of the __get_user() function, which can lead to arbitrary information leakage for the FBIOPUTCMAP_SPARC and FBIOGETCMAP_SPARC commands. This is because the __get_user() function does not properly handle the signedness of the index variable, allowing an attacker to manipulate the value of index and potentially leak sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the get_user() function instead of __get_user() to ensure proper signedness handling.
2. Validate the input values of index and count to prevent potential information leakage.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to __get_user(), such as kstrtol() or kstrtoul(), to handle user input.
