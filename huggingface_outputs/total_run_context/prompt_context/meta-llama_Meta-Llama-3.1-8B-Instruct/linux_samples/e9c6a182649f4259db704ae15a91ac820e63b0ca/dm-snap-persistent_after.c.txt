 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 11, 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential information disclosure and modification vulnerability due to the interpretation conflict in the drivers/md/dm-snap-persistent.c in the Linux kernel. The vulnerability is caused by the incorrect handling of the mapping to a snapshot block device, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information or modify data. The code is vulnerable because it does not properly validate the input and does not handle the exceptions correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input to the function to ensure that it is within the expected range.
2. Properly handle the exceptions to prevent information disclosure and modification.
3. Use a secure method to handle the mapping to a snapshot block device.
4. Review the code to ensure that it is free from any other potential vulnerabilities.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that it is following the secure coding practices and guidelines.
