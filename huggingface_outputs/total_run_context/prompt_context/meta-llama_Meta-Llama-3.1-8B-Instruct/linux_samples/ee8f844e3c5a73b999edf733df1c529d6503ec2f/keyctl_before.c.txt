 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-9604 because it allows root to gain direct access to an internal keyring by joining it as its session keyring. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement proper access control to prevent root from joining internal keyrings.
2.  Validate the input to the `join_session_keyring` function to ensure it is not an internal keyring.
3.  Consider using a more secure method to manage keyrings, such as using a separate keyring for each user or process. 
4.  Regularly review and update the code to ensure it is not vulnerable to known security issues.  This includes keeping up to date with the latest security patches and updates.  This will help to prevent similar vulnerabilities from being introduced in the future.  This is especially important for critical systems where security is paramount.
