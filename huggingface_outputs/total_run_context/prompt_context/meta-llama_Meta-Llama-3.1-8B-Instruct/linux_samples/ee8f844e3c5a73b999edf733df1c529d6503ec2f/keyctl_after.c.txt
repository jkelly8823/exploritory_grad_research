 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-9604 because it allows root to join a session keyring with a name that starts with a dot, which is not permitted. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the name starts with a dot before joining the session keyring.
2. If the name starts with a dot, return an error instead of joining the session keyring.
3. Consider adding a check to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to join the session keyring. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-9604
CVE Description:
It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
