 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a kernel pointer leak. The FDGETPRM ioctl allows an attacker to obtain a kernel pointer, which can be used to discover the location of kernel code and data. This can be used to bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the FDGETPRM ioctl handler, as it allows an attacker to obtain a kernel pointer.
2. Use a safer alternative to copy kernel data to user memory, such as using a kernel-side buffer and copying the data to user memory through a safe interface.
3. Implement kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) to make it more difficult for attackers to discover the location of kernel code and data.  ```python
