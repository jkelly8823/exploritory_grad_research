 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a kernel pointer leak. The FDGETPRM ioctl allows an attacker to obtain a kernel pointer to the floppy_struct structure. This can be used to bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the FDGETPRM ioctl handler to prevent kernel pointer leaks.
2. Use a safer method to pass data between the kernel and user space, such as using a buffer to store the data.
3. Implement kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) to make it more difficult for attackers to exploit this vulnerability.  ```bash
