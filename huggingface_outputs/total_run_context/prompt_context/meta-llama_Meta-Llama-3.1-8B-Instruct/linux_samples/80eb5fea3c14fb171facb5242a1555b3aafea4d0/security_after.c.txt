 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Spectre-RSB attacks because the Spectre-RSB mitigation is not in place for all applicable CPUs. This is related to the lack of firmware feature flags or hypervisor bits to indicate the need to flush the link stack on context switch.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement firmware feature flags or hypervisor bits to indicate the need to flush the link stack on context switch.
2. Ensure that the Spectre-RSB mitigation is in place for all applicable CPUs.
3. Review and update the code to handle the lack of firmware feature flags or hypervisor bits.
4. Consider using alternative mitigations, such as software-based Spectre-RSB mitigation, to protect against Spectre-RSB attacks. 5. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it remains secure against Spectre-RSB attacks. 6. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as code review, to ensure that the code is secure against Spectre-RSB attacks. 7. Consider using a secure coding tool, such as a static analysis tool, to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 8. Consider using a secure coding practice, such as
