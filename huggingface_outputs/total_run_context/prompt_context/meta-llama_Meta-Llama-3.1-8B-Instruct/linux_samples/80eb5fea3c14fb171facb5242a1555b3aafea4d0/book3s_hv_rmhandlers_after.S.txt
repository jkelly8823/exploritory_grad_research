 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre-RSB (Return Stack Buffer) attack due to the lack of mitigation for all applicable CPUs. This is related to the arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S and arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c files. The vulnerability is present in the guest_exit_short_path function, where a blr instruction is executed without proper link stack flushing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement the Spectre-RSB mitigation for all applicable CPUs.
2. Flush the link stack before executing the blr instruction in the guest_exit_short_path function.
3. Review and update the arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S and arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c files to ensure proper Spectre-RSB mitigation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18660
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 5.4.1 on powerpc allows Information Exposure because the Spectre-RSB mitigation is not in place for all applicable CPUs, aka CID-39e72bf96f58. This is related to arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S and arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c. 
CVE_ID:C
