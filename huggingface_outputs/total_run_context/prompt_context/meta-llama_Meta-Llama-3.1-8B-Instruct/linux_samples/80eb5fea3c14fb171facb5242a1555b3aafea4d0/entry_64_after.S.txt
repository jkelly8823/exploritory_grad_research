 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to the Spectre-RSB attack due to the lack of proper mitigation. The code is using the mflr instruction to save the link register (LR) into r9, but it is not properly flushing the link stack. This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper mitigation for Spectre-RSB attack by using the mtlr instruction to restore the link register (LR) before returning from the function.
2. Use the mtlr instruction to restore the link register (LR) before flushing the link stack.
3. Consider using the Spectre-RSB mitigation patch to prevent this vulnerability. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18660
