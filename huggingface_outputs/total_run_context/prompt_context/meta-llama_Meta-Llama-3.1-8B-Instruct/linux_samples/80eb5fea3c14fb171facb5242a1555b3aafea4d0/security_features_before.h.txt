 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre-RSB (Return Stack Buffer) vulnerability due to the lack of mitigation for all applicable CPUs. The SEC_FTR_DEFAULT macro is missing the SEC_FTR_FLUSH_COUNT_CACHE feature, which is required to flush the count cache on context switch. This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add the SEC_FTR_FLUSH_COUNT_CACHE feature to the SEC_FTR_DEFAULT macro to ensure that the count cache is flushed on context switch.
2. Review the code to ensure that all applicable CPUs have the Spectre-RSB mitigation in place. VULNERABILITY LIST:
