 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Spectre-RSB (Return Stack Buffer) attack due to the lack of mitigation for all applicable CPUs. This is related to the arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S and arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c files. The specific line of code that is vulnerable is the first line of the code sample, which includes the necessary header files for the powerpc architecture.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the Spectre-RSB mitigation should be implemented for all applicable CPUs. This can be done by adding the necessary code to the arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S and arch/powerpc/kernel/security.c files. Additionally, the kernel version should be updated to 5.4.1 or later to ensure that the mitigation is in place. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-18660
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 5.4.1 on powerpc allows Information Exposure because the Spectre-RSB mitigation is not in place for all applicable CPUs, aka CID-39e72bf96f58. This is related to arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_64.S
