 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The variable `escan_buflen` is calculated from the `escan_result_le` structure, but it is not checked if it is within the bounds of the `e->datalen` variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `escan_result_le` structure is larger than the `e->datalen` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that `escan_buflen` is within the bounds of `e->datalen` before using it.
2. Consider using a safer method to calculate `escan_buflen`, such as using a bounds-checked function.
3. Consider adding additional error checking to handle cases where `escan_result_le` is NULL or has an invalid structure.
