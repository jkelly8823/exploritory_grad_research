 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly interacts with PCI command registers. It appears to be a configuration file for a module, and does not contain any code that could be used to disable memory or I/O decoding for a PCI Express device. Therefore, it does not appear to be vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could be used to exploit the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is secure and follows best practices for coding. Additionally, the module should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-2150
CVE Description:
Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x and the Linux kernel through 3.19.1 do not properly restrict access to PCI command registers, which might allow local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (non-maskable interrupt and host crash) by disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI Express device and then accessing the device,
