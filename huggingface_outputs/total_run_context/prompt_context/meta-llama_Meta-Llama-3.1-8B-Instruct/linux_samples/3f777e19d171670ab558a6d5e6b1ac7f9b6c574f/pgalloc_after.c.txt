 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the lack of synchronization when upgrading the page table. The `__tlb_flush_local()` function is called after the page table upgrade, but it does not guarantee that the upgrade is complete before flushing the TLB. This can lead to a situation where the TLB is flushed before the page table upgrade is complete, resulting in a crash or code execution vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to synchronize access to the page table upgrade and TLB flush operations.
2. Use a barrier to ensure that the page table upgrade is complete before flushing the TLB.
3. Consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a spinlock or a mutex, to protect the page table upgrade and TLB flush operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-11884
CVE Description:
In the Linux kernel 4.19 through 5.6.7 on the s390 platform, code execution may occur because of a race condition, as demonstrated by code in enable_sacf_uaccess in arch/s390/lib/uaccess.c that fails to protect against a
