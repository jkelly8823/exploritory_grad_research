 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (disk consumption) and possibly gain privileges via the PR_SET_DUMPABLE argument of the prctl function and a program that causes a core dump file to be created in a directory for which the user does not have permissions. This is due to the fact that the code allows a local user to dump core files as root in mode 2, which can lead to a denial of service and potentially allow the user to gain privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the permissions of the directory where the core dump file is being created to ensure that the user has write access.
2. Use a more secure method to determine the dumpable state of the process, such as using the prctl function with the PR_GET_DUMPABLE argument.
3. Implement additional checks to prevent a local user from causing a denial of service by creating a large number of core dump files.
