 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain the tipc_msg_build function, which is the function that contains the vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11. The code sample provided is related to the TIPC bearer and L2 bearer association, which is a different part of the Linux kernel.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample provided does not contain the vulnerable function, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the code that calls the tipc_msg_build function to ensure that it is properly validated and sanitized. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the Linux kernel up to date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-8632
CVE Description:
The tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 does not validate the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) by leveraging the CAP
