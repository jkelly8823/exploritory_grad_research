 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) due to the lack of validation of the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel (CVE-2016-8632). The code checks if the MTU is bad using the tipc_mtu_bad function, but it does not validate the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size before calling tipc_mtu_bad function.
2. Use a secure function to calculate the MTU, such as tipc_mtu_good, which validates the relationship between the minimum fragment length and the maximum packet size.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle the MTU, such as using a fixed MTU value or using a secure MTU calculation function.
