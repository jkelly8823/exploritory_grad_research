 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-13080 because it silently accepts key re-installation without really installing the new version of the key. This can lead to nonce reuse or replay issues. The vulnerability is present in lines 15-17 where the code checks if the old key and the new key have the same length and are equal. If they are, it silently accepts the key re-installation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the silent key re-installation logic and instead properly install the new key version.
2. Update the code to handle key re-installation properly, ensuring that nonce reuse or replay issues are avoided.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as key rotation or authentication, to further mitigate potential attacks.  ```rust
