 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the mwifiex_set_wmm_params() function of Marvell Wifi Driver. This is due to the lack of bounds checking on the length of the wmm_ie and rate_ie pointers. If the length of these pointers is greater than the expected size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on the length of the wmm_ie and rate_ie pointers to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer function like memcpy_s() to copy data into the bss_cfg->rates and bss_cfg->wmm_info structures.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the rates and wmm_info data. This would eliminate the need for manual bounds checking.
