 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the memcpy function. The memcpy function is copying a buffer of size vs_ie->len + 2 into a destination buffer of size le16_to_cpu(ie->ie_length). However, the size of the destination buffer is not checked to be large enough to hold the copied data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the destination buffer is less than the size of the copied data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it.
2. Use a safer function like memmove to copy data in case the source and destination buffers overlap.
3. Consider using a buffer that is large enough to hold the maximum possible size of the copied data.
