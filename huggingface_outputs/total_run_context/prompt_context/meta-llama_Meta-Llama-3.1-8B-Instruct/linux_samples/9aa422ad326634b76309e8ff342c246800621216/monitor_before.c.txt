 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a stack overflow flaw. The sanity checks performed in the code ensure that the received domain record is valid before proceeding, which prevents any potential malicious content from causing a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any modifications to prevent the specified vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST:  CVE_ID:CVE-2022-0435, CVE Description: A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.
