 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the `glen` variable. The `tipc_get_gap_ack_blks` function returns the length of the gap ACK blocks, but it is not checked if this length is within the bounds of the `data` buffer. If the length is larger than the buffer size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, causing the program to crash or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking on the `glen` variable to ensure it does not exceed the size of the `data` buffer.
2. Consider using a safer function to copy the gap ACK blocks, such as `memcpy` with bounds checking.
3. Review the `tipc_get_gap_ack_blks` function to ensure it returns a valid length and does not overflow the buffer.
