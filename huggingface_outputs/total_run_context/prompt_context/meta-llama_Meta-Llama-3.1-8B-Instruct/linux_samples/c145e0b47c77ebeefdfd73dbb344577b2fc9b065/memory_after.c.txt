VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 11-12, 17-18, 23-24, 29-30, 35-36, 41-42, 47-48, 53-54, 59-60
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-29374 vulnerability. This vulnerability is related to the get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation in the Linux kernel. The implementation does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access. This vulnerability is present in the code due to the use of the get_user_pages function without proper consideration of the read operations. The code is also vulnerable to other issues such as the use of the swapcache without proper handling of the refcount, and the use of the lru_add_drain function without proper consideration of the pagevec.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the get_user_pages function with proper consideration of the read operations.
2. Properly handle the refcount of the swapcache.
3. Use the lru_add_drain function with proper consideration of the pagevec.
4. Use the swap_free function with proper consideration of the swap entry
