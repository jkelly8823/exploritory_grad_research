 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the complete_emulated_mmio function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel. This is due to a loop that triggers an invalid memory copy affecting certain cancel_work_item data. The code is checking for page faults and no device interrupts, but it does not properly handle the exception bitmap, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the exception bitmap properly to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a safer method to handle page faults and no device interrupts.
3. Implement a bounds checking mechanism to prevent invalid memory copies.

CVE_ID:CVE-2014-0049
CVE Description:
Buffer overflow in the complete_emulated_mmio function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.6 allows guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS by leveraging a loop that triggers an invalid memory copy affecting certain cancel_work_item data.  VULNERABLE: YES
