 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the incorrect handling of the calling parameters count in the pkexec utility. The code attempts to calculate the required stack space by multiplying the number of arguments and environment variables by the size of a pointer. However, it does not account for the possibility of environment variables being crafted to induce the execution of arbitrary code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Implement a more robust check for the calling parameters count to prevent the execution of environment variables as commands.
2.  Validate the input parameters to prevent an attacker from crafting environment variables that can induce the execution of arbitrary code.
3.  Consider using a safer alternative to `pkexec` that is not vulnerable to this issue. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-4034
CVE Description:
A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't
