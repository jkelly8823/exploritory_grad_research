 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11478. The vulnerability is related to the TCP retransmission queue implementation in the Linux kernel. The code checks if the sk_wmem_queued value is greater than the limit, but it does not properly handle the case where the queue is fragmented. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2019-11478.
2. Implement additional checks to handle fragmented queues.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure to represent the retransmission queue. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles all possible scenarios, including fragmented queues.  ```bash
