 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-5828 because it mishandles transactional state when starting a new thread. The tm_reclaim_current function is called with an argument of 0, which may not be sufficient to properly clear the transactional state. This can lead to a denial of service or system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the tm_reclaim_current function call to pass the correct argument to ensure proper clearing of transactional state.
2. Consider adding additional checks to ensure that the transactional state is properly cleared before starting a new thread. 
3. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling transactional state in all scenarios.  ```
