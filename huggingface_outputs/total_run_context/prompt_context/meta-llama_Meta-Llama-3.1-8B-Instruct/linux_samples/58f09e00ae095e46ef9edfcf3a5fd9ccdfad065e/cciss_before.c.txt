 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a kernel memory leak due to the lack of initialization of the LUN_info structure. This allows an attacker to potentially obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the LUN_info structure before copying data from user space to kernel space.
2. Use a safer function like kmemdup to copy the data from user space to kernel space. 
3. Check the return value of copy_from_user to handle potential errors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2147
CVE Description:
The HP Smart Array controller disk-array driver and Compaq SMART2 controller disk-array driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4 do not initialize certain data structures, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via (1) a crafted IDAGETPCIINFO command for a /dev/ida device, related to the ida_locked_ioctl function in drivers/block/cpqarray.c or (2) a crafted CCISS_PASSTHRU32 command for a /dev/cciss device, related to the cciss_ioctl32_passthru function in
