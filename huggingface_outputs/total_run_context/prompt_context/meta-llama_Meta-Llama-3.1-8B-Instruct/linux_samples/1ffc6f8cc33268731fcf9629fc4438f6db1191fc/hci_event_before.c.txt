VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the Bluetooth legacy BR/EDR PIN code pairing vulnerability (CVE-2020-26555) because it does not properly validate the BD_ADDR of the peer device. The `hci_proto_connect_ind` function is called with the `bdaddr` field of the `ev` structure, which can be spoofed by an unauthenticated nearby device. This allows the device to complete pairing without knowledge of the PIN.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the BD_ADDR of the peer device before calling `hci_proto_connect_ind`. This can be done by checking if the BD_ADDR is within the expected range or by using a secure method to verify the device's identity.
2. Consider using a secure pairing method, such as Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), which is resistant to this type of attack. 
3. Update the Bluetooth Core Specification to the latest version (5.3 or later) which includes security enhancements to prevent this type of attack.  ```python
