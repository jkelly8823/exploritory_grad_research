 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) due to the lack of memory allocation for limb data in the mpi_powm function. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2016-8650) that can be exploited by an attacker through an add_key system call for an RSA key with a zero exponent.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Allocate memory for limb data before using it.
2. Implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Use a secure method to handle zero exponents in RSA key operations. 
4. Regularly update the Linux kernel to the latest version to ensure that all known vulnerabilities are patched.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000366
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 does not properly restrict access to the /proc filesystem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted /proc/self/task/[pid]/comm read operation.

Code Sample:
	struct task_struct *task;
	struct mm_struct *mm;
	struct files_struct *files;
	struct cred *cred;
	struct task_struct *
