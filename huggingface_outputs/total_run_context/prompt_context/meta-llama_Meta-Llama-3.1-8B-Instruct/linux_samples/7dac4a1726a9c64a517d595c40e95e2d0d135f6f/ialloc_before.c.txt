 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) due to the lack of validation of the bitmap block number. The ext4_valid_block_bitmap function is not called to validate the bitmap block number, which is necessary to prevent an out-of-bounds read and system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call the ext4_valid_block_bitmap function to validate the bitmap block number before accessing it.
2. Check the return value of ext4_valid_block_bitmap to ensure it is valid before proceeding.
3. Consider adding additional error checking to handle potential errors when accessing the bitmap block. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1093
CVE Description:
The ext4_valid_block_bitmap function in fs/ext4/balloc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image because balloc.c and ialloc.c do not validate bitmap block numbers.  The code sample provided does not call the ext4_valid_block_bitmap function, which is necessary to prevent this vulnerability.
