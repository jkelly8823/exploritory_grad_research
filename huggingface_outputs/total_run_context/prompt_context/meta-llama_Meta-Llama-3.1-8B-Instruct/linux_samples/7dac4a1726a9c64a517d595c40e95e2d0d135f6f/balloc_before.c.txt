 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) due to the lack of validation of bitmap block numbers. The ext4_valid_block_bitmap function does not check if the block bitmap block number is set before accessing it, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read and system crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the bitmap block numbers before accessing them.
2. Use a safe function to access the block bitmap, such as ext4_block_bitmap_safe.
3. Add error handling to handle cases where the block bitmap block number is not set. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1093
CVE Description:
The ext4_valid_block_bitmap function in fs/ext4/balloc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image because balloc.c and ialloc.c do not validate bitmap block numbers.  ```
