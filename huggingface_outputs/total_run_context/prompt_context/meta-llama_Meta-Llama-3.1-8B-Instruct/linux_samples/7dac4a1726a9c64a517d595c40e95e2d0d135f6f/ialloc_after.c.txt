 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) due to the lack of validation of bitmap block numbers. The ext4_valid_block_bitmap function is not called to validate the bitmap block number, which is a critical step in preventing such attacks. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2018-1093, where the ext4_valid_block_bitmap function was not called, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Call the ext4_valid_block_bitmap function to validate the bitmap block number before using it.
2. Use a more robust validation mechanism to ensure that the bitmap block number is within the valid range.
3. Consider using a more secure data structure, such as a hash table, to store the bitmap block numbers. This would prevent the possibility of out-of-bounds reads and system crashes. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1093
CVE Description:
The ext4_valid_block_bitmap function in fs/ext4/balloc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read
