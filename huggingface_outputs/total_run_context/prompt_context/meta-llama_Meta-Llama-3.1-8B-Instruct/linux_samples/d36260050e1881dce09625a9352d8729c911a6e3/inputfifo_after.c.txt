 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function ia_css_inputfifo_send_embedded_line() does not check the length of the data array before copying it to the inputfifo instance. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data array is larger than the allocated buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the length of the data array is within the allocated buffer size before copying it.
2. Consider using a safer function like memcpy_s() to copy the data array.
3. Consider adding bounds checking to the inputfifo instance to prevent buffer overflows.
