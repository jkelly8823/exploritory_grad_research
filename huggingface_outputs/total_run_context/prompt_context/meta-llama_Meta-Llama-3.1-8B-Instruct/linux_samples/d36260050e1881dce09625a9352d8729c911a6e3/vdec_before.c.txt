 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel v4l2 video driver. This is due to the lack of input validation on the'size' variable. An attacker could potentially manipulate the'size' variable to access memory outside the bounds of the 'fmt' array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add input validation on the'size' variable to ensure it does not exceed the bounds of the 'fmt' array.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the 'fmt' array.
3. Implement a bounds checking mechanism to prevent accessing memory outside the bounds of the 'fmt' array.
