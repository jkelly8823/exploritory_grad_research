 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of a counter to track the number of times a certain condition is met. The counter is not reset when the pin is put back to idle, which means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the counter to gain unauthorized access. This is a classic example of a timing attack vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reset the counter when the pin is put back to idle.
2. Use a more secure method to track the number of times a certain condition is met, such as using a secure random number generator.
3. Consider using a more secure timing mechanism, such as a hardware-based timer.
