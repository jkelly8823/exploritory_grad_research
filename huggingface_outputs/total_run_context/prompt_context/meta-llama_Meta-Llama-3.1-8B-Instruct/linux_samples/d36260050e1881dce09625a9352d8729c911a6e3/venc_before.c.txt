 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel v4l2 video driver. This is due to the lack of input validation on the'size' variable in the for loop. An attacker could potentially manipulate the'size' variable to access memory outside the bounds of the 'fmt' array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the'size' variable to ensure it is within the bounds of the 'fmt' array.
2. Use a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the 'fmt' data.
3. Implement bounds checking on the 'i' variable in the for loop to prevent out-of-bounds access.
