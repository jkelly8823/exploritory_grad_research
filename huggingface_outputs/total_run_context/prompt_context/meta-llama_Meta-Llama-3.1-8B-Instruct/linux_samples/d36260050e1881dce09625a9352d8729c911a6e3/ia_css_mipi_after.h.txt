 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a kernel driver for a camera interface (MIPI). The function ia_css_mipi_frame_calculate_size() calculates the size of a MIPI frame based on various parameters such as width, height, format, and embedded data size. The function ia_css_mipi_frame_enable_check_on_size() checks if a MIPI frame can be enabled based on its size. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE description (CVE-2017-13166), which is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel v4l2 video driver. The code seems to be focused on calculating and checking the size of MIPI frames, which does not directly relate to the vulnerability described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE description. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential security issues and to ensure that it follows secure coding practices. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential issues related to memory management, as the functions may allocate or deallocate memory.
