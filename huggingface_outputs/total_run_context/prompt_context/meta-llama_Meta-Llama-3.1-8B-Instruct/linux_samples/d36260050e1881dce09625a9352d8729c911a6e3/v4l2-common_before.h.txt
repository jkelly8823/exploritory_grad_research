 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a macro definition for a function that finds the nearest size in an array of image sizes. The macro checks the size of the fields in the driver specific struct and uses the BUILD_BUG_ON macro to ensure that the fields are of the correct size. This prevents a potential vulnerability where the fields could be of the wrong size, causing the function to return incorrect results or crash. The macro then calls the __v4l2_find_nearest_size function with the correct parameters. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-13166 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to prevent the CVE-2017-13166 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and secure.
