VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition. The function __wdt_on_master_slave_sensor() is not thread-safe. The rt_mutex_lock() and rt_mutex_unlock() calls are not sufficient to prevent concurrent access to the isp->sw_contex.file_input variable. This is because the mutex is locked before checking the condition atomisp_buffers_queued() and unlocked before setting the variable isp->sw_contex.file_input. This can lead to a situation where multiple threads are accessing and modifying the variable simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock that covers the entire critical section, including the check and the assignment. This can be achieved by moving the rt_mutex_lock() call before the check and the assignment, and the rt_mutex_unlock() call after the assignment.
2. Consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a spinlock or a semaphore, to protect access to the isp->sw_contex.file_input variable.
3. Avoid using the FIXME! comment, as it is not a valid C preprocessor directive. Instead, use a more descriptive comment to indicate that the code needs to be reviewed and improved.
