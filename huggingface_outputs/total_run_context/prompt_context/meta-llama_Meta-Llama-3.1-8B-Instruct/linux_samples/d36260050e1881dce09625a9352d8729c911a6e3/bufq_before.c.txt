 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The buffer_type_to_queue_id_map array is not checked for bounds before being used as an index. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access if the value of buf_type is greater than or equal to SH_CSS_MAX_SP_THREADS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a bounds check before using the buffer_type_to_queue_id_map array as an index.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced binary search tree, to store the mapping between buffer types and queue IDs.
3. Ensure that the value of buf_type is validated and sanitized before being used as an index.
