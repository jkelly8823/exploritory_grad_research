 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential infinite recursion in the resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode function. This is because the function calls itself recursively without any base case, leading to a stack overflow. This is a classic example of a recursive function without a proper termination condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we can add a base case to the recursive function to prevent infinite recursion. For example, we can add a check to see if the function has already been called recursively and return an error if it has. We can also consider rewriting the function to use a loop instead of recursion to avoid the potential stack overflow. Additionally, we can add logging or debugging statements to help identify the cause of the infinite recursion.
