 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel v4l2 video driver. This is due to the lack of proper validation of the endpoint node, which can lead to an attacker being able to manipulate the endpoint node and gain elevated privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the endpoint node properly before parsing it.
2. Check the bus type of the endpoint node before proceeding with the CSI2 configuration.
3. Use a secure method to handle the endpoint node, such as using a secure buffer to store the endpoint node data.
