 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-13166. The code snippet is focused on retrieving clock sources for a JPEG decoder, which does not seem to be related to the kernel v4l2 video driver.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVE. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that clock sources are properly managed and released to prevent potential issues. Consider adding error handling for the devm_clk_get calls to ensure that the clock sources are properly released in case of an error.  ```c
if (IS_ERR(jpeg->clk_jdec)) {
    devm_clk_put(jpeg->dev, jpeg->clk_jdec);
    return PTR_ERR(jpeg->clk_jdec);
}
``` 
```c
if (IS_ERR(jpeg->clk_jdec_smi)) {
    devm_clk_put(jpeg->dev, jpeg->clk_jdec_smi);
    return PTR_ERR(jpeg->clk_jdec_smi);
}
```
