 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege attack due to the use of assert statements. The assert statements are used to check if the input parameters are within a valid range. However, an attacker could potentially manipulate the input parameters to bypass the assert checks and gain elevated privileges. This is a classic example of a CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace the assert statements with proper error handling mechanisms, such as returning an error code or throwing an exception.
2. Validate the input parameters more thoroughly, using techniques such as input validation and sanitization.
3. Consider using a more secure programming paradigm, such as using a secure coding library or framework.
