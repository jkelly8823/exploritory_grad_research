 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that directly interacts with the kernel v4l2 video driver. The configure_kernel function is called, but the function itself is not shown in the provided code sample. The configure_dma function is also called, but it does not appear to be related to the kernel v4l2 video driver. The ia_css_configure_vf function is called, but it does not appear to be related to the kernel v4l2 video driver. The code sample does not contain any code that would allow an attacker to exploit the CVE-2017-13166 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-13166 vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the configure_kernel function to ensure that it does not contain any vulnerabilities. It is also recommended to review the configure_dma function to ensure that it does not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to review the ia_css_configure_vf function to ensure that it does not contain any vulnerabilities.  The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-13166 vulnerability. However
