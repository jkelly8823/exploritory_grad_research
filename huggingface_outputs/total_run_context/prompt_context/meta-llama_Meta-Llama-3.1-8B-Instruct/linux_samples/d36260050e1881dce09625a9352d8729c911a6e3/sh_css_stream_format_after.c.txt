 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential out-of-bounds access due to the lack of bounds checking in the switch statement. The switch statement does not check if the input format is within the valid range before accessing the corresponding case. This can lead to undefined behavior if an invalid input format is passed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the switch statement to ensure that the input format is within the valid range.
2. Consider using an enum with a limited set of values to prevent invalid input formats from being passed.
3. Use a more robust data structure, such as a struct or a class, to represent the input format and its corresponding values. This can help to encapsulate the data and provide better error handling.
