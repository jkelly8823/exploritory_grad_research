 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would allow an attacker to elevate privileges. The imx274_write_reg function is a kernel function and the dev_err and dev_dbg functions are also kernel functions. The code is checking for an error condition and returning it, which is a good practice. However, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-13166.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities and to ensure that error handling is properly implemented.
