 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking in the SCTBL_BYTES macro. The SCTBL_BYTES macro calculates the size of the sctbl_bytes array based on the sctbl_height variable, but it does not check if the calculated size is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the sctbl_height variable is larger than the actual size of the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the SCTBL_BYTES macro to ensure that the calculated size is within the bounds of the array.
2. Use a safer method to calculate the size of the array, such as using the sizeof operator on the array itself.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the sctbl_height variable, such as using a fixed-size array or a dynamically allocated buffer with bounds checking.
