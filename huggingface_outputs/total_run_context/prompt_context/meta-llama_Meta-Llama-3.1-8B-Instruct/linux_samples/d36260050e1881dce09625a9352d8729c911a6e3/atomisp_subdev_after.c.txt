 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking in the for loop. An attacker could potentially manipulate the loop counter to access and modify sensitive kernel memory, leading to a privilege escalation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to the for loop to prevent it from accessing out-of-bounds indices.
2. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced binary search tree, to store and look up the conversion table.
3. Ensure that the conversion table is properly initialized and validated to prevent any potential security issues.
