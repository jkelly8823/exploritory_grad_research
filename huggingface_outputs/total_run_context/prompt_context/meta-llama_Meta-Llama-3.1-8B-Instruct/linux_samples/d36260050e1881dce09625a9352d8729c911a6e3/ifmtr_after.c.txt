VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10, 15-20, 25-30, 35-40, 45-50, 55-60, 65-70, 75-80, 85-90, 95-100
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of proper bounds checking on the input parameters. Specifically, the variables `width_a`, `width_b`, `start_column`, and `line_width` are not checked for valid values before being used to calculate the buffer offsets. This can lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker provides malicious input that causes these variables to exceed their valid ranges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper bounds checking on the input parameters to ensure they are within their valid ranges.
2. Use a safer method to calculate the buffer offsets, such as using a library function that handles bounds checking.
3. Consider using a more secure data type, such as a `size_t` or `ptrdiff_t`, to represent the buffer offsets to prevent overflows.
4. Review the code to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and validated before use.
