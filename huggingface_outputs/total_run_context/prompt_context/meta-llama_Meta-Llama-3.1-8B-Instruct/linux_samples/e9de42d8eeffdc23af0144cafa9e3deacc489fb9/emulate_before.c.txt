 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) due to the miscalculation of the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure in the kvm_iommu_map_pages function. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2014-3601) that can be exploited by guest OS users to trigger a large gfn value or a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kvm_iommu_map_pages function to correctly calculate the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure.
2. Implement additional checks to prevent guest OS users from triggering a large gfn value or a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.
3. Consider using a more secure method for handling page mappings, such as using a secure page table walker. 
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that it is free from known vulnerabilities. 5. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 6. Implement a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 7. Consider using a secure coding standard to ensure
