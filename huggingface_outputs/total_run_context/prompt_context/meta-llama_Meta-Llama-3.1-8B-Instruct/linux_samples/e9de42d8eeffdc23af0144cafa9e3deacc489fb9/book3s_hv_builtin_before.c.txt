 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) due to the miscalculation of the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where the number of pages is small, leading to permanently pinned pages.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Properly handle the case where the number of pages is small by checking for it and taking appropriate action.
2.  Use a more robust method to calculate the number of pages to avoid miscalculations.
3.  Consider adding a check to ensure that the number of pages is not too large to prevent memory corruption. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-3601
CVE Description:
The kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to (1) cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value or (
