 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) due to the miscalculation of the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure. This is a result of the kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1. The code does not properly handle the gfn value, which can lead to a large gfn value or a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kvm_iommu_map_pages function to properly calculate the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure.
2. Implement proper error handling for the gfn value to prevent large or small gfn values from causing issues.
3. Consider using a more robust memory management system to prevent memory corruption.
