 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2014-4508 because it does not properly handle the syscall number. When the syscall number is invalid, it causes an OOPS and system crash. This is due to the fact that the code does not check for the syscall number before calling the sys_call_table.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the syscall number before calling the sys_call_table.
2. Use a more secure method to handle invalid syscall numbers, such as returning an error code instead of crashing the system. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle syscall auditing, such as using a separate thread or process to handle auditing.
