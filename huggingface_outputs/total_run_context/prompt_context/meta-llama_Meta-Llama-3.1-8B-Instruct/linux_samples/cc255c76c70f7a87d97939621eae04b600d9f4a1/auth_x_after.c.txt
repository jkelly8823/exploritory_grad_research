 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1129. The vulnerability is due to the way signature calculation is handled by cephx authentication protocol. The attacker can bypass signature checks done by cephx protocol by altering the message payload. The code is vulnerable because it does not properly validate the message payload before calculating the signature.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the message payload before calculating the signature.
2. Use a secure method to calculate the signature, such as using a cryptographic hash function.
3. Ensure that the cephx protocol is properly configured to prevent tampering with the message payload.
