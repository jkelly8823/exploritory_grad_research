 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1129 because it does not properly validate the message payload before calculating the signature. An attacker can manipulate the message payload to bypass the signature checks. The vulnerability is present in the lines where the CRC values are being copied from the message to the sigblock structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the message payload before calculating the signature.
2. Use a secure method to calculate the signature, such as using a cryptographic hash function.
3. Consider using a more secure authentication protocol, such as Kerberos. 
4. Update the ceph code to the latest version, which includes the fix for CVE-2018-1129.  ```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1129
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way signature calculation was handled by cephx authentication protocol. An attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to alter the message payload was able to bypass signature checks done by cephx protocol. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable.

Code Sample:

struct ceph
