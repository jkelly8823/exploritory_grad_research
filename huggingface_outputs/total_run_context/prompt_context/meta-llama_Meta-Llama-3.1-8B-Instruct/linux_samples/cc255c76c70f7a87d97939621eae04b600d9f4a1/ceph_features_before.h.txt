 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to CVE-2018-1129 due to the overlap of feature flags. The Cephx authentication protocol relies on the uniqueness of feature flags to ensure the integrity of the authentication process. However, in this code sample, feature flags are being reused, which can lead to a bypass of the signature checks done by the Cephx protocol.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that feature flags are unique and not reused.
2. Review the Cephx authentication protocol implementation to ensure it is correctly handling the feature flags.
3. Consider using a more robust authentication mechanism to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1129
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way signature calculation was handled by cephx authentication protocol. An attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to alter the message payload was able to bypass signature checks done by cephx protocol. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable. 

Code Sample:
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int
