CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest.

This can lead to a situation where pages are freed while still accessible by the VMM and
