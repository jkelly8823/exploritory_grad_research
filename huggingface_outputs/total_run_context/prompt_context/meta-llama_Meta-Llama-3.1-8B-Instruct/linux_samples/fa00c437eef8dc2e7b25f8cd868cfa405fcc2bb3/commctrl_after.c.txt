 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the lack of synchronization between the size calculation and the actual DMA operation. The size calculation is done before the DMA operation, but the DMA operation is not atomic, and the size value can be changed between the calculation and the DMA operation. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing the size value.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to synchronize the size calculation and the DMA operation.
2. Use a atomic operation to update the size value.
3. Use a DMA operation that is atomic and cannot be interrupted by other threads. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-6480
CVE Description:
Race condition in the ioctl_send_fib function in drivers/scsi/aacraid/commctrl.c in the Linux kernel through 4.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability.  VULNERABLE: YES
