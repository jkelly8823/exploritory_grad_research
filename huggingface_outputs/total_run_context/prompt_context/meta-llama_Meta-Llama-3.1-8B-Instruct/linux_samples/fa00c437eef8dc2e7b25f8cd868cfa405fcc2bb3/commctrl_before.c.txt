 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain the race condition vulnerability described in CVE-2016-6480. The code checks for the in_reset condition and ensures that the size of the fib is within the allowed range before proceeding. The race condition described in the CVE is related to the ioctl_send_fib function, but the provided code sample does not appear to be the implementation of this function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the described vulnerability. However, it is recommended to review the implementation of the ioctl_send_fib function to ensure that it does not contain the described vulnerability. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly synchronized to prevent race conditions.
