 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided appears to be a part of a wireless driver for a Linux kernel. It checks for certain conditions related to management frames and their handling in a probe queue or a CAB (Control-Access-Block) queue. The conditions checked include whether the frame is a management frame, whether it's non-bufferable, and whether it's a deauthentication or disassociation frame. The code seems to be handling these cases correctly and doesn't appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities related to the CVE-2017-0786 description.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and doesn't require any changes to address the specified vulnerability. However, it's always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets the required security standards. Additionally, the code could benefit from comments and documentation to improve its maintainability and readability.
