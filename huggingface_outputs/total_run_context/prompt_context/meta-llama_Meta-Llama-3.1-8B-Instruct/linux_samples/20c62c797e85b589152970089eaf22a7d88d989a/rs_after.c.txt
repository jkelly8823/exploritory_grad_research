 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. The variable 'tid_data' is not checked for null before being dereferenced. This could lead to a segmentation fault if 'tid_data' is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a null check for 'tid_data' before dereferencing it.
2. Consider using a more robust way to handle the case where 'tid_data' is null, such as returning an error code or logging a warning.
