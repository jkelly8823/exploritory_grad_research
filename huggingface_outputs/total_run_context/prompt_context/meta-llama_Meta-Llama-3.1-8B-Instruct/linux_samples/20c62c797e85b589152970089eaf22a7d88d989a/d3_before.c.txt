 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-0786 because it is setting the IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART and IWL_MVM_STATUS_D3_RECONFIG bits in the mvm->status without proper validation. This can potentially lead to an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Broadcom wi-fi driver.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proper validation for the mvm->status bits before setting them.
2. Consider using a unified image to prevent switching between images.
3. Handle the error while exiting D3 properly to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
