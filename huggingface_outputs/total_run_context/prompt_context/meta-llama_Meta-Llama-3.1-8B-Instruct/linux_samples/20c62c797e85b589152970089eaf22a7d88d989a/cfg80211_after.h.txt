VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock) is locked, but the cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info) function is called before the lock is released. This could potentially allow other threads to access the mac->scan_req pointer before it is properly cleaned up, leading to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The mutex_lock should be released before calling cfg80211_scan_done, and then reacquired after the function call. This will ensure that the mac->scan_req pointer is properly cleaned up before other threads can access it. The corrected code would look like this:
mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock);
if (mac->scan_req) {
	cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info);
}
mutex_unlock(&mac->mac_lock); 
mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock); 
This will ensure that the lock is released before cfg80211_scan_done is called, and then reacquired after the function call. This will prevent the race condition.  The corrected code would look like this:
mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock);
if (mac->scan_req
