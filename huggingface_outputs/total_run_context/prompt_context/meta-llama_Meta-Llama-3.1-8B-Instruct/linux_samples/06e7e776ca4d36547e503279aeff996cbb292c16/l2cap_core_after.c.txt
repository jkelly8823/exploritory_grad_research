 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-1000410 vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the processing of incoming L2CAP commands - ConfigRequest, and ConfigResponse messages. The code does not properly initialize the efs variable, which can lead to an info leak. The attacker can manipulate the code flows that precede the handling of these configuration messages to gain control over which data will be held in the uninitialized stack variables. This can allow the attacker to bypass KASLR and stack canaries protection.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize the efs variable properly before using it.
2. Validate the length of the input configuration parameters to prevent the attacker from manipulating the code flows.
3. Use a secure method to handle the configuration messages, such as using a secure buffer to store the configuration data.
