 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code. This vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code to prevent directory traversal attacks.
2. Validate user input to prevent malicious requests.
3. Use secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-28374
CVE Description:
In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore.  The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the `dev_
