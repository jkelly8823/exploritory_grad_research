 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference and OOPS due to the econet_sendmsg function in net/econet/af_econet.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2. This is because the code does not check for NULL values in the saddr and msg->msg_namelen variables before dereferencing them. The code also does not check for the correct size of the msg->msg_namelen variable before using it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that saddr is not NULL before dereferencing it.
2. Add a check to ensure that msg->msg_namelen is greater than or equal to the size of struct sockaddr_ec before using it.
3. Use a safer way to copy the values from saddr to addr, such as using memcpy or struct assignment. 
4. Use a safer way to access the device with the right network number, such as using a lock or a safer data structure. 
5. Use a safer way to access the ec_cb structure, such as using a lock or a safer data structure.  VULNER
