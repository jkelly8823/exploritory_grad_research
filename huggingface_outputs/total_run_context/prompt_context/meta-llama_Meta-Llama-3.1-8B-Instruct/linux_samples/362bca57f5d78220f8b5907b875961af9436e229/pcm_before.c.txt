 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any use-after-free vulnerability. The snd_pcm_info_user function is called before the mutex is unlocked, ensuring that the information is retrieved before the lock is released. This prevents any potential use-after-free issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure in this regard. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-0861
CVE Description:
Use-after-free vulnerability in the snd_pcm_info function in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel allows attackers to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

Code Sample:
			if (substream->runtime->hw->device == NULL) {
				err = -ENXIO;
				goto _error;
			}
			err = snd_pcm_info_user(substream, info);
		_error:
			mutex_unlock(&register_mutex);
			return err;
		}
