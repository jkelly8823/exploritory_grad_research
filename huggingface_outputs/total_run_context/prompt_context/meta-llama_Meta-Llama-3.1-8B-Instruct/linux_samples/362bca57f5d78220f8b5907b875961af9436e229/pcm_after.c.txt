 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the use-after-free vulnerability described in CVE-2017-0861. The mutex_lock and mutex_unlock calls are properly paired, and there is no indication that the snd_pcm_info_user function is being called after the pcm->open_mutex has been unlocked.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that all mutexes are properly locked and unlocked to prevent potential deadlocks or other concurrency issues.  The code could be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of the mutexes and the locking/unlocking logic. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-0861
CVE Description:
Use-after-free vulnerability in the snd_pcm_info function in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel allows attackers to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.  The vulnerability occurs when the snd_pcm_info function is called after the pcm->open_mutex has been unlocked.  This can happen when the snd_pcm_info function is called from a different thread or process after the mutex has been unlocked.  The vulnerability can be
