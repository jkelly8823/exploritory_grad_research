 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be related to the vfio interface implementation. The code snippet is related to adding dynamic IDs for PCI devices. The vfio interface is used for device assignment and memory management, which is not present in this code sample. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to CVE-2019-3882.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the vfio interface implementation. However, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3882
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.

Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	if (x >
