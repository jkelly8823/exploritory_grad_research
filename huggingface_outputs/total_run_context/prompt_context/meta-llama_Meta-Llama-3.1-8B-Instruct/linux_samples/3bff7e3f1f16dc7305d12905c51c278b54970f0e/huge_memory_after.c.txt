 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-29374 issue. This is because the get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access. The lines 14-16 are where the vulnerability is present. The code is trying to map the page writable if there are no additional references, but it does not properly check for read operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check for read operations before granting write access.
2. Properly consider the semantics of read operations in the get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation.
3. Use a more secure method to map the page writable, such as using a separate lock or a more secure locking mechanism. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-29374
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write
