 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-29374 issue. This is because the get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access. Specifically, lines 14-16 are vulnerable because they do not properly check for read-only access before granting write access.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the page is marked as read-only before granting write access.
2. Use the pmdp_set_access_flags function with the correct flags to ensure that the page is properly marked as read-only.
3. Consider using a more secure implementation of get_user_pages that properly considers the semantics of read operations. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-29374
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-178
