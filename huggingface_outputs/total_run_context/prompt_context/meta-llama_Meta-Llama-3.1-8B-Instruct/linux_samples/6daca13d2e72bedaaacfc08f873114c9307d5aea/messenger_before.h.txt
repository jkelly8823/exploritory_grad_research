 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly relates to the cephx authentication protocol or the verification of ceph clients. The functions declared in the code are related to getting and verifying authorizers, but the actual implementation of these functions is not shown. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the code is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-1128 vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To determine if the code is vulnerable, the implementation of the get_authorizer, verify_authorizer_reply, and invalidate_authorizer functions should be reviewed. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential replay attacks or other authentication-related vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1128
CVE Description:
It was found that cephx authentication protocol did not verify ceph clients correctly and was vulnerable to replay attack. Any attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to sniff packets on network can use this vulnerability to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions allowed by ceph service. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable.
