 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is vulnerable to a replay attack due to the lack of verification of ceph clients. This is consistent with the description of CVE-2018-1128. The vulnerability is present in the function `verify_authorizer_reply` where it does not verify the ceph clients correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a verification mechanism to ensure that the ceph clients are correctly authenticated before allowing them to perform actions.
2. Use secure communication protocols such as SSL/TLS to encrypt the communication between the ceph clients and the ceph service.
3. Regularly update the ceph cluster to the latest version to ensure that the vulnerability is patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1128
CVE Description:
It was found that cephx authentication protocol did not verify ceph clients correctly and was vulnerable to replay attack. Any attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to sniff packets on network can use this vulnerability to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions allowed by ceph service. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable.
