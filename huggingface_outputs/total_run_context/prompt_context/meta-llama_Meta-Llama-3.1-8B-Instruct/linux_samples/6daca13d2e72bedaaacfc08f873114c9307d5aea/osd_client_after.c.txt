 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a replay attack due to the lack of verification of ceph clients. This is consistent with the description of CVE-2018-1128. The vulnerability is present in the return statement of the function, which does not verify the ceph client correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a verification mechanism to ensure that the ceph client is authentic before allowing it to perform actions.
2. Use a secure authentication protocol to prevent replay attacks.
3. Update the code to use the latest ceph branch that is not vulnerable to this issue.
