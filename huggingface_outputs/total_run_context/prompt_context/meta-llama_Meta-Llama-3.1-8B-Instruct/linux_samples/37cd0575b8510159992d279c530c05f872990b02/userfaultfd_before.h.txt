 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct implementation of the apparmor_setprocattr function. However, the vulnerability is related to the lack of buffer size validation in this function. The code sample appears to be a header file, and it does not contain any implementation that could potentially lead to the exploitation of this vulnerability. Nevertheless, the vulnerability is still applicable to the codebase if the apparmor_setprocattr function is implemented elsewhere in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the implementation of the apparmor_setprocattr function in the codebase to ensure that it validates the buffer size.
- Consider using a secure coding practice, such as using a safe string copy function, to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
- If the apparmor_setprocattr function is not used in the codebase, consider removing it to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000112
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists in the way the Linux kernel handles the "perf_event_open" system call, which allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain privileges.

Code Sample:
int perf
