 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential AppArmor bypass vulnerability. The apparmor_setprocattr function in the Linux kernel does not validate the buffer size, which allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an AppArmor setprocattr hook. This vulnerability is present in the code snippet provided, specifically in the line where the apparmor_setprocattr function is called. However, the code snippet does not directly call the apparmor_setprocattr function, but it does contain a potential vulnerability in the form of a missing buffer size validation check. This check is necessary to prevent a potential buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a buffer size validation check to prevent a potential buffer overflow attack.
2. Ensure that the apparmor_setprocattr function is called with a validated buffer size to prevent a potential AppArmor bypass vulnerability.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to the apparmor_setprocattr function, such as a function that validates the buffer size before calling the apparmor_setprocattr function.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
