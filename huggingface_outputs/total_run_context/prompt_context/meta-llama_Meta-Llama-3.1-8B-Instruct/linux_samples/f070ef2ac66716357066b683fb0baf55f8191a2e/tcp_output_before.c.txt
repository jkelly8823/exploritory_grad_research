 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for a buffer overflow. The first line of code checks if nsize is less than 0 and sets it to 0 if it is. However, this does not prevent a buffer overflow if nsize is a large negative number. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that nsize is not a large negative number before setting it to 0.
2. Consider using a more robust method to handle buffer overflows, such as using a safe copy function.
3. Ensure that the code is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security issues. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-11478
CVE Description:
Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP retransmission queue implementation in tcp_fragment in the Linux kernel could be fragmented when handling certain TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) sequences. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182
