 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the potential for a large number of TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) sequences to be sent, causing the TCP retransmission queue to become fragmented. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel, specifically in the tcp_fragment implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version that includes the fix for this vulnerability (e.g. 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11).
2. Implement additional checks to prevent the TCP retransmission queue from becoming fragmented, such as limiting the number of SACK sequences that can be sent.
3. Consider using a more secure alternative to the TCP retransmission queue implementation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1000001
CVE Description:
A vulnerability in the Linux kernel's handling of TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) sequences could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 4.14
