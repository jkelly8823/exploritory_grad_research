 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7097 vulnerability because it preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call. This allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(posix_acl_create); line to prevent the setgid bit from being preserved.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the setgid bit is not preserved during a setxattr call.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle extended attributes, such as using a secure ACL implementation.
