 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7097 vulnerability because it preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call. This allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions. The code does not properly update the inode's mode to remove the setgid bit, which is a requirement to prevent this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to properly remove the setgid bit from the inode's mode after updating the ACL.
2. Use the `i_uid` and `i_gid` fields of the inode to set the ownership of the file, rather than relying on the setgid bit.
3. Consider using a more secure method to update the inode's mode, such as using the `setattr` system call with the `S_ISGID` flag set to 0.
