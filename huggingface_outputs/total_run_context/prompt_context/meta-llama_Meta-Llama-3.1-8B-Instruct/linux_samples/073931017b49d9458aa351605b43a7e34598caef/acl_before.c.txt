 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7097 vulnerability because it preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call. This allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions. The code checks if the ACL is equivalent to a traditional file mode, and if so, it sets the inode's mode to the equivalent mode. However, this does not remove the setgid bit, which is a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the setgid bit from the inode's mode when the ACL is equivalent to a traditional file mode.
2. Use a more secure method to handle ACLs, such as using a separate data structure to store the ACL information.
3. Consider using a more secure kernel implementation, such as the one provided by the upstream Linux kernel.
