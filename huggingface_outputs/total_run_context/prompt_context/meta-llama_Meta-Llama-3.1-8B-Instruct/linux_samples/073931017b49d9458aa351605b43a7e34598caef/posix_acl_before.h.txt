 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any direct implementation of the filesystem or setxattr functionality. It appears to be a set of function declarations related to POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists) and simple ACLs. The code does not directly address the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7097, which is related to the preservation of the setgid bit during a setxattr call. However, it's worth noting that the code may be used in conjunction with other code that implements the vulnerable functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Review the code that calls these functions to ensure that it properly handles ACLs and setgid permissions. Consider implementing additional checks or safeguards to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly audited and tested to prevent any potential security issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-7097
CVE Description:
The filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.  Code Sample:
int setxattr
