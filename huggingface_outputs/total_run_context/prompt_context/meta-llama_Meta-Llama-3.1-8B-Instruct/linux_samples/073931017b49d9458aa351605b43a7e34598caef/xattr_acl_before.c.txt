 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7097 vulnerability. The code snippet is checking for ACL_TYPE_ACCESS and ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT, but it does not seem to be setting the setgid bit or preserving it during a setxattr call. The code is actually checking for equivalent POSIX ACL modes and setting the inode's mode accordingly. This does not match the behavior described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets security requirements.  ```bash
