 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not contain any direct implementation of the filesystem or setxattr functionality. It appears to be a collection of function declarations related to POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists). The vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7097 is related to the Linux kernel's filesystem implementation, which is not present in this code snippet. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this specific issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code and does not implement the affected functionality. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to the implementation of POSIX ACLs or other security-critical functionality. Additionally, ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-7097
CVE Description:
The filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.

Code Sample:
int setxattr(const char *path, const char *name, const void
