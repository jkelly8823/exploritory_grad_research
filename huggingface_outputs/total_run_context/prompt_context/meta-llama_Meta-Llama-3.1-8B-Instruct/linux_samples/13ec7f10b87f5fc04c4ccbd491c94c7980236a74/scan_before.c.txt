 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the current_ptr to the bss_entry->ssid.ssid and bss_entry->data_rates arrays without checking the bounds of the element_len variable. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the element_len is larger than the size of the destination array, allowing an attacker to corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a bounds check to ensure that element_len is not larger than the size of the destination array.
2. Use a safer function like strlcpy or strncpy to copy the data, which can handle the bounds checking internally.
3. Consider using a more secure way to handle the data, such as using a buffer with a fixed size and checking the length of the data before copying it. 4.
