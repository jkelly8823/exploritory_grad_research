 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. In the WLAN_EID_SSID case, the code checks if the element_len is greater than IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN, but it does not perform the same check for the WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES case. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and corrupt memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for element_len in the WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES case to ensure it does not exceed MWIFIEX_SUPPORTED_RATES.
2. Consider using a safer function like strncpy to copy the data into the buffer, to prevent buffer overflows. 
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle the data, such as using a secure memory allocation function. 
4. Consider adding a check to ensure that the current_ptr points to a valid memory location before performing the memcpy operation. 
5. Consider adding a check to ensure that the element_len is a positive value before performing the memcpy operation.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
