 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14, 25-29
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (memory consumption) attack. This is because the code does not properly handle the case where a socket is sent over a UNIX socket before it is closed. This allows an attacker to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause the system to consume increasing amounts of memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the socket is not sent over a UNIX socket before it is closed.
2. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of sockets that can be sent over a UNIX socket.
3. Consider using a more robust locking mechanism to prevent concurrent access to the socket list. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4312
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it, related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/unix/garbage.c.  VULNERABLE: YES
