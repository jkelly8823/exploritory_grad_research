VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4312
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to bypass file-descriptor limits and cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending each descriptor over a UNIX socket before closing it, related to net/unix/af_unix.c and net/unix/garbage.c.

Code Sample:
	int x = 5;
	if (x > 10) {
		printf("x is greater than 10\n");
