 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11479 because it does not properly enforce the TCP maximum segment size (MSS). The MSS is calculated based on the minimum of the base MSS and the calculated MSS, which can be set to a low value by a remote peer. This allows a remote attacker to fragment the TCP resend queues, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that includes the fix for CVE-2019-11479 (e.g., kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11).
2. Apply the patches (commits 967c05aee439e6e5d7d805e195b3a20ef5c433d6 and 5f3e2bf008c2221478101ee72f5cb4654b9fc363) to the kernel source code.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures to prevent MSS manipulation attacks.
