 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-11479 because the minimum MSS is hard-coded to 48 bytes (which is half of the minimum MTU of 96 bytes). This allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced. The code does not enforce a larger MSS, which is a requirement to fix this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the code to enforce a larger MSS, such as the minimum MTU of 96 bytes.
2. Use a more secure method to calculate the MSS, such as using the `tcp_mss_to_mtu` function with a larger value. 
3. Consider using a more secure TCP implementation that does not have this vulnerability.  ```c
