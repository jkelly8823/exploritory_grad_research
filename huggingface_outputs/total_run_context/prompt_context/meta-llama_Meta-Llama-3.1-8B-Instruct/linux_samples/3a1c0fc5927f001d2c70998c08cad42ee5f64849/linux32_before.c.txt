 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted system call due to the lack of proper sign extension of 32-bit arguments in 64-bit registers. This is a known vulnerability in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier on certain platforms.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability.
2. Implement proper sign extension of 32-bit arguments in 64-bit registers.
3. Validate user input to prevent crafted system calls. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2009-0029
CVE Description:
The ABI in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier on s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips 64-bit platforms requires that a 32-bit argument in a 64-bit register was properly sign extended when sent from a user-mode application, but cannot verify this, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted system call.  The code sample provided does not directly contain the vulnerability, but the vulnerability is
