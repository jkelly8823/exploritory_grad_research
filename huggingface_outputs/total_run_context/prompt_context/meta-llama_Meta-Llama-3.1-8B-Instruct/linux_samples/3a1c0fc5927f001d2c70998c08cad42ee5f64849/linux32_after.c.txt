 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2009-0029 vulnerability. The merge_64 macro is used to merge two 32-bit values into a 64-bit value, but it does not properly sign extend the 32-bit value. This can lead to incorrect results when working with 64-bit values. The RESOURCE32 macro also does not properly handle 64-bit values, as it uses a 32-bit mask to check for infinity.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the merge_64 macro to properly sign extend the 32-bit value using the following code: #define merge_64(r1, r2) ((((r2) & 0xffffffffUL) << 32) + ((r1) & 0xffffffffUL) | 0xffffffff00000000UL)
2. Update the RESOURCE32 macro to properly handle 64-bit values using the following code: #define RESOURCE32(x) ((x > RLIM_INFINITY32)? RLIM_INFINITY32 : (x < -RLIM_INFINITY32)? -RLIM_INFINITY32 : x) 
3. Consider using 64-bit types and macros throughout the code
