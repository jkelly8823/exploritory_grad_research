VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is a snippet from the Linux kernel's entry_32.S file, which handles system call entry points for 32-bit x86 platforms. The code checks for an invalid system call number and jumps to the sysenter_after_call label if it is encountered. This is a valid and expected behavior in the kernel. The vulnerability described in CVE-2014-4508 is related to syscall auditing and the sep CPU feature flag, which is not present in this code snippet. Therefore, this code is not vulnerable to the described vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
