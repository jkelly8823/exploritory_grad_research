VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code that would be susceptible to the CVE-2013-2891 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to a heap-based out-of-bounds write in the HID subsystem, which is not present in this code sample. The code sample appears to be a simple error handling mechanism for a HID device.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested before deployment.  ```bash
