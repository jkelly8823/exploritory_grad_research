 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to attacks by backends due to the use of grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions. This can result in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Synchronize the freeing of the related data page with dropping the granted access.
2. Use a lock to prevent concurrent access to the grant reference.
3. Implement a retry mechanism to handle the race condition.
4. Use a more robust method to check if the grant reference is still in use.
