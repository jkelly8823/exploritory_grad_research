 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-12154 because it does not ensure that the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" L0 vmcs02 controls exist in cases where L1 omits the "use TPR shadow" vmcs12 control. This allows KVM L2 guest OS users to obtain read and write access to the hardware CR8 register.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" L0 vmcs02 controls exist in cases where L1 omits the "use TPR shadow" vmcs12 control.
2. Use a conditional statement to check if the "use TPR shadow" vmcs12 control is present before setting the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" L0 vmcs02 controls.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle the CR8 register, such as using a software-based CR8 shadow.
