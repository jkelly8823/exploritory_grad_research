 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-12154 vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not ensure that the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" L0 vmcs02 controls exist in cases where L1 omits the "use TPR shadow" vmcs12 control. This allows KVM L2 guest OS users to obtain read and write access to the hardware CR8 register.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" L0 vmcs02 controls exist in cases where L1 omits the "use TPR shadow" vmcs12 control.
2. Implement the merging of IO bitmap functionality to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
3. Review and update the code to ensure that it is secure and compliant with the latest security standards.
