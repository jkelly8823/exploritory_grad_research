 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any code related to the skb_flow_dissect function or the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation. The code snippet appears to be a part of the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) system, which is used for packet filtering and manipulation in the Linux kernel. It defines BPF program types and map types, but does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a denial of service (infinite loop) due to a small value in the IHL field.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the given CVE. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets the required security standards.  ```bash
```bash
VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000112
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel through 4.13.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted bpf program that leads to a use-after-free vulnerability in the bpf verifier.

Code Sample:
struct bpf_map *map_ptr;
map
