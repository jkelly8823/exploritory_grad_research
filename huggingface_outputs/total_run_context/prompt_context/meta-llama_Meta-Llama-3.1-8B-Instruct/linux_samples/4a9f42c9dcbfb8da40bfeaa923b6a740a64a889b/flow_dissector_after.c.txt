 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (infinite loop) via a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation. This is due to the skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to a version greater than 3.12 to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement a check for the IHL field value to prevent infinite loops.
3. Use a more robust parsing mechanism to handle IPIP encapsulation packets. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-4348
CVE Description:
The skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a small value in the IHL field of a packet with IPIP encapsulation.  This vulnerability is present in the code sample provided.  The code sample is vulnerable because it does not check for the IHL field value, which can cause an infinite loop if it is small.  To
