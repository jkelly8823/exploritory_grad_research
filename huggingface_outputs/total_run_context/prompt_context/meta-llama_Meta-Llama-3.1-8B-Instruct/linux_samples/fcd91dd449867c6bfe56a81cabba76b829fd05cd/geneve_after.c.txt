 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The skb_gro_pull function is called with a variable length (gh_len) which can lead to a stack consumption and panic if the packet is large enough. The skb_gro_postpull_rcsum function is also called with the same variable length, which can further exacerbate the issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a fixed length for skb_gro_pull and skb_gro_postpull_rcsum to prevent stack consumption.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the packet length is within a safe range before calling these functions.
3. Consider using a more robust packet handling mechanism that can handle large packets without consuming the stack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-8666
CVE Description:
The IP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for large crafted packets, as demonstrated by packets that contain only VLAN headers.
