 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The use of the GRO path for such packets can lead to a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact. The vulnerability is present in the line where the `pp` variable is assigned, as it does not check for the presence of VLAN headers in the packet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for VLAN headers in the packet before using the GRO path. This can be done by adding a check for the presence of VLAN headers in the `eth_gro_receive` function. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle large crafted packets more robustly, such as by limiting the size of packets that can be processed by the GRO path. This can be done by adding a check for the packet size in the `eth_gro_receive` function.
