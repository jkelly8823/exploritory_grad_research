 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2016-7039 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The GRO (Generic Receive Offload) path is used for large packets, but it does not properly handle packets with VLAN headers, leading to a denial of service or unspecified other impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper handling for packets with VLAN headers in the GRO path.
2. Add checks to prevent the use of the GRO path for packets with VLAN headers.
3. Consider using a more robust packet handling mechanism to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-8666
CVE Description:
The IP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for large crafted packets, as demonstrated by packets that contain only VLAN headers.

Code Sample:
	/* Used to determine if flush_id can be ignored */
	u8	is_atomic:1;
