 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The skb_gro_postpull_rcsum function is called without checking if the packet is too large, which can lead to a denial of service or unspecified other impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the packet size is within a safe limit before calling skb_gro_postpull_rcsum.
2. Implement a mechanism to handle large packets that contain only VLAN headers, such as by dropping them or sending an error packet. 
3. Consider upgrading to a newer version of the Linux kernel that includes a fix for this vulnerability. 4. Consider implementing a packet filtering mechanism to prevent large packets from being processed. 5. Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent VLAN header attacks. 6. Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent large packet attacks. 7. Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent crafted packet attacks. 8. Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent packet fragmentation attacks. 9. Consider implementing a mechanism to detect and prevent packet reassembly attacks. 10. Consider
