 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The skb_gro_pull function is called with a variable length (gh_len) which can lead to a stack consumption and panic if the packet is large enough. The skb_gro_postpull_rcsum function is also called with the same variable length, which can further exacerbate the issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a fixed length for skb_gro_pull and skb_gro_postpull_rcsum to prevent stack consumption.
2. Implement a check to ensure that the packet length is within a safe range before calling skb_gro_pull and skb_gro_postpull_rcsum.
3. Consider using a more robust packet handling mechanism that can handle large packets without consuming the stack.  ```c
