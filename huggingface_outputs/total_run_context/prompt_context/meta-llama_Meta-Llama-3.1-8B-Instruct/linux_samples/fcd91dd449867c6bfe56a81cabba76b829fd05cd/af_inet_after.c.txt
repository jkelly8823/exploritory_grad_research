 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The skb_gro_pull function is called with the size of the iph structure, which may not be sufficient to handle large packets. This can lead to a denial of service or unspecified other impact.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the size of the packet before calling skb_gro_pull to ensure it is sufficient to handle the packet.
2. Consider using a more robust method to handle large packets, such as using a buffer that can handle the maximum expected packet size.
3. Implement additional error checking to handle cases where the packet is too large or malformed.  ```c
if (skb->len > sizeof(*iph)) {
    // handle large packet
}
