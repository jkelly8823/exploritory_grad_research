 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. This can cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact. The vulnerability is present in the call_gro_receive function, which is called with a crafted packet that triggers the GRO path. The skb_gro_remcsum_cleanup function is called after the call to call_gro_receive, but it does not properly clean up the GRO context, leading to a potential denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the packet size is within a safe range before calling call_gro_receive.
2. Implement proper cleanup of the GRO context after calling call_gro_receive.
3. Consider using a more robust packet handling mechanism that can handle large crafted packets.
