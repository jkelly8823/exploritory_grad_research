 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2016-7039 because it does not properly handle large crafted packets that contain only VLAN headers. The skb_gro_pull function is called with a size that is too small, which can lead to a stack consumption and panic.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase the size of the skb_gro_pull function call to handle larger packets.
2. Add a check to ensure that the packet does not contain only VLAN headers before calling skb_gro_pull. 
3. Consider using a more robust method to handle large packets, such as using a separate buffer to store the packet data.  ```c
skb_gro_pull(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr) + VLAN_HLEN);
``` 
4. Add a check to ensure that the packet is not too large before calling skb_gro_pull.  ```c
if (skb->len > sizeof(struct udphdr) + VLAN_HLEN) {
    // handle large packet
}
``` 
5. Consider using a more secure method to handle packet data, such as using a secure buffer or a separate memory pool.  ```c
struct sk_buff *skb_copy
