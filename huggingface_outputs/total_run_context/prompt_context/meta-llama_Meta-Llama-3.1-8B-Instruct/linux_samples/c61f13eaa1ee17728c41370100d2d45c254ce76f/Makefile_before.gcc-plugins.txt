 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-2141. The vulnerability is related to the initialization of a data structure in the kernel's signal handling code, which is not present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that could introduce the described vulnerability. However, it's worth noting that this code is likely part of a build system or configuration file, and it's not intended to be executed as code. It's possible that the vulnerability could be introduced in a different part of the codebase, but based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of a vulnerability.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2141
CVE Description:
The do_tkill function in kernel/signal.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.9 does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted application that makes a (1) tkill or (2) tgkill system call.  Code Sample: 
    ifeq ($(CONFIG_SMP),y)
