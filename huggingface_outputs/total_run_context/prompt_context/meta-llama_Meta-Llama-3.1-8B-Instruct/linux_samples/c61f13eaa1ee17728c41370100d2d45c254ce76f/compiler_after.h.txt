 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any code that directly relates to the described vulnerability. The vulnerability is specific to the do_tkill function in kernel/signal.c, which is not present in this code snippet. The code snippet appears to be a set of macros and definitions for handling memory access and attribute checking, which does not match the description of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any code that would introduce the described vulnerability. However, it is essential to ensure that any code that interacts with the kernel or uses system calls is thoroughly reviewed and tested to prevent similar vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of macros and definitions should be carefully managed to avoid introducing new vulnerabilities or making the code more complex than necessary.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-2141
CVE Description:
The do_tkill function in kernel/signal.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.9 does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted application that makes a (1) tkill or (2) tgkill system call.  Code Sample:
int
