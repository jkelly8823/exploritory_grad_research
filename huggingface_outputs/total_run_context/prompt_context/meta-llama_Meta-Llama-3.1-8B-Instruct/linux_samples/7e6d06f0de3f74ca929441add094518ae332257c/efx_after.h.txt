 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2012-3412 because it does not properly handle small MSS values in TCP packets. The efx_enqueue_skb function is called with a crafted TCP packet that triggers a small MSS value, causing the DMA descriptor consumption and network-controller outage.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check in the efx_enqueue_skb function to ensure that the MSS value is not too small.
2. Implement a mechanism to handle small MSS values, such as by dropping the packet or sending an error message.
3. Update the efx_tx_max_skb_descs function to handle small MSS values correctly. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3412
CVE Description:
The sfc (aka Solarflare Solarstorm) driver in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DMA descriptor consumption and network-controller outage) via crafted TCP packets that trigger a small MSS value. 
Code Sample:
efx_enqueue_skb(struct efx_tx_queue *tx_queue, struct sk_buff *skb);
extern void efx_xmit_done(struct efx_tx_queue *tx
