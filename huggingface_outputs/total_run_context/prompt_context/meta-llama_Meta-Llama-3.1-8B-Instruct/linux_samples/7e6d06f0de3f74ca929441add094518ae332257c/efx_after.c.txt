VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3412
CVE Description:
The sfc (aka Solarflare Solarstorm) driver in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DMA descriptor consumption and network-controller outage) via crafted TCP packets that trigger a small MSS value.  The code sample does not appear to contain any code that would be vulnerable to this type of attack.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code for
