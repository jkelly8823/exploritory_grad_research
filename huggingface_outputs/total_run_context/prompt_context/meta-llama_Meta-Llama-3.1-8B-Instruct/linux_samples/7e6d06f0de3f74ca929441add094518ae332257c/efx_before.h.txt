 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the Solarflare Solarstorm driver or the specific vulnerability CVE-2012-3412. The code appears to be a part of a network driver, but it does not include any code that handles TCP packets or DMA descriptors, which are the specific components affected by the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerable code, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential vulnerabilities related to the handling of TCP packets or DMA descriptors. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2012-3412
CVE Description:
The sfc (aka Solarflare Solarstorm) driver in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DMA descriptor consumption and network-controller outage) via crafted TCP packets that trigger a small MSS value. 
Code Sample:
int efx_setup_tc(struct net_device *net_dev, u8 num_tc);
int efx_setup_tc(struct net_device *net_dev, u8 num_tc) {
    struct efx_nic *efx = net
