 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the inode_capable function does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes. This allows a local user to bypass intended chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace and then setting the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the inode_capable function to properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes.
2. Use the inode_owner_or_capable function to check for ownership and capabilities before allowing chmod operations. 
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a capability-based access control system.  ```c
bool inode_owner_or_capable(const struct inode *inode)
{
	if (uid_eq(current_fsuid(), inode->i_uid))
		return true;
	if (capable(CAP_FOWNER))
		return true;
	return false;
}
