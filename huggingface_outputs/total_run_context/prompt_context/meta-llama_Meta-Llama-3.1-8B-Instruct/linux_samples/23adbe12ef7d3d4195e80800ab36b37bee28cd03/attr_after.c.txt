 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes, allowing a local user to bypass intended chmod restrictions. The code checks for the setgid bit, but it does not properly handle the case where the user is in the group that owns the file. This allows a user to set the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root, even if they do not have the necessary permissions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the user is in the group that owns the file before checking the setgid bit.
2. Use the `in_group_p` function to check if the user is in the group that owns the file.
3. Use the `capable_wrt_inode_uidgid` function to check if the user has the necessary permissions to set the setgid bit.
