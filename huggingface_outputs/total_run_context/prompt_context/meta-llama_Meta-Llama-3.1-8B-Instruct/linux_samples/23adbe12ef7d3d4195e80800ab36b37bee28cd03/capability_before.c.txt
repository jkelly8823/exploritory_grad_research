 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the inode_capable function does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes. The function checks if the inode's owner maps into the current user namespace, but it does not check if the inode is owned by a child namespace. This allows a local user to bypass intended chmod restrictions by creating a user namespace and setting the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the inode_capable function to properly check if the inode is owned by a child namespace.
2. Consider using a more secure approach to check for capabilities, such as using a capability map.
3. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling user namespaces and inode ownership.  ```
