 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the capable_wrt_inode_uidgid function does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes. The function checks if the current task has the given capability targeted at its own user namespace, but it does not check if the inode's uid and gid are mapped into the current user namespace. This allows a local user to bypass intended chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace and setting the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the capable_wrt_inode_uidgid function to properly check if the inode's uid and gid are mapped into the current user namespace.
2. Add a check to ensure that the inode's uid and gid are not mapped into the current user namespace before allowing the capability check to proceed.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a separate function to check if the inode's uid and gid are mapped into the current user namespace. This would help to keep the capable_wrt_inode_uidgid function focused on its primary responsibility of checking capabilities.
