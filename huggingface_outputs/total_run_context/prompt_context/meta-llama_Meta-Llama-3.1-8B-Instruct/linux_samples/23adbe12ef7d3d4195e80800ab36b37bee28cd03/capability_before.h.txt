 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is related to the Linux kernel and deals with capabilities. The function get_vfs_caps_from_disk() is used to get the capabilities from a file. However, the description of the vulnerability CVE-2014-4014 mentions that the capabilities implementation does not properly consider namespaces for inodes. This could potentially lead to a vulnerability if the code does not properly handle the capabilities for files in different namespaces.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the code to ensure that it properly handles capabilities for files in different namespaces.
2. Consider adding additional checks to ensure that the capabilities are correctly applied to files in different namespaces.
3. If necessary, update the code to use the correct namespace when getting the capabilities from a file. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-4157
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 3.15.4 does not properly restrict the use of the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, which allows local users to bypass intended restrictions and gain privileges.

Code Sample:
				      int cap);
extern bool capable(int cap);
extern bool ns_capable(struct user_namespace *ns, int cap);
extern bool inode
