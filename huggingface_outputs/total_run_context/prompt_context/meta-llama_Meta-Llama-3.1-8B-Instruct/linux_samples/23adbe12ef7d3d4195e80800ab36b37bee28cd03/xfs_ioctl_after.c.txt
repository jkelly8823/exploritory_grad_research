 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes. The line of code that checks if the inode has the S_ISUID or S_ISGID bits set and if the current process is capable of setting the file setgid bit, does not take into account the user namespace. This allows a local user to bypass intended chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace and then setting the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The code should be modified to properly consider the user namespace when checking if the current process is capable of setting the file setgid bit. This can be done by using the cap_userns_capable function to check if the current process has the CAP_SETUID capability in the user namespace.
2. The code should also be modified to properly handle the case where the inode has the S_ISUID or S_ISGID bits set but the current process is not capable of setting the file setgid bit. In this case, the code should not clear the S_ISUID or S_ISG
