 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5, 8-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes, allowing a local user to bypass intended chmod restrictions. The code checks for the CAP_CHOWN capability, but it does not check for the CAP_FSETID capability when setting the setgid bit. This allows a user to set the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root, even if they do not have the CAP_FSETID capability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check for the CAP_FSETID capability when setting the setgid bit.
2. Remove the check for the CAP_CHOWN capability, as it is not necessary.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle inode capabilities, such as using a separate function to check for capabilities.
