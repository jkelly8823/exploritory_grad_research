 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2014-4014 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes, which allows local users to bypass intended chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace. The code checks for the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability, but it does not check if the capability is applicable to the inode. This allows an attacker to set the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the capability is applicable to the inode before checking for the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability.
2. Use the capable_wrt_inode_uidgid function to check if the capability is applicable to the inode.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a capability mask to determine which capabilities are applicable to the inode.
