 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage) due to the ipv6_create_tempaddr function not properly handling problems with the generation of IPv6 temporary addresses. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel through 3.8. The code attempts to regenerate a temporary address when the ipv6_add_addr function fails, but it does not properly handle the failure, leading to excessive retries and a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the Linux kernel to a version that fixes this issue (3.9 or later).
2. Implement a timeout mechanism to prevent excessive retries.
3. Add error handling to properly handle the failure of ipv6_add_addr and prevent the denial of service. 
4. Consider using a more robust method for generating temporary addresses.  ```
