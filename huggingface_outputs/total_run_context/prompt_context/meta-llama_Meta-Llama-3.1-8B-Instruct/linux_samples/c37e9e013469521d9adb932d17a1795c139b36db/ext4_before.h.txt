 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided checks for valid inode numbers in the ext4 filesystem. It appears to be a defensive check to prevent out-of-bound writes. However, the actual vulnerability (CVE-2018-10882) is related to the ext4 filesystem's transaction handling, not the inode number validation. The code sample does not contain the vulnerable transaction handling code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is not vulnerable to the specified CVE. However, it is recommended to review the surrounding code to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities related to the ext4 filesystem's transaction handling.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-10882
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound write in in fs/jbd2/transaction.c code, a denial of service, and a system crash by unmounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image.

Code Sample:
int ext4_unmount(struct super_block *sb)
{
	int ret;
	struct ext4_sb_info *sbi = EXT4_SB(sb);
	struct ext4_journal_handle *journal_handle
