 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2018-10882. The vulnerability is present in the fs/jbd2/transaction.c code, which is not shown in the provided code sample. However, the vulnerability is triggered when a local user unmounts a crafted ext4 filesystem image. The code sample provided checks for certain conditions that could potentially lead to the vulnerability, but it does not address the root cause of the issue. The conditions checked are: sbi->s_inode_size < EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE,!is_power_of_2(sbi->s_inode_size), and sbi->s_inode_size > blocksize. These conditions are not sufficient to prevent the vulnerability, as they only check for specific values of sbi->s_inode_size, but do not account for the out-of-bound write that can occur when unmounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The code should be modified to check for the out-of-bound write condition when unmounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image. This can be done by adding a check for the es->s_inode_size value in the fs/jbd2/transaction
