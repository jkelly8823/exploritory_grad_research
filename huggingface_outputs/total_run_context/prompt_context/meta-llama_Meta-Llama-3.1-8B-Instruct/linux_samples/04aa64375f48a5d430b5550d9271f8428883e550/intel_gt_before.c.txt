 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the incorrect TLB flush issue due to the lack of TLB flush after writing to the i915 GPU register. This is a potential security risk as it may lead to random memory corruption or data leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a TLB flush after writing to the i915 GPU register to ensure correct TLB flush.
2. Consider using a more secure method to handle TLB flush, such as using the `i915_mmio_reg_offset` function to check if the TLB needs to be flushed before writing to the register.
