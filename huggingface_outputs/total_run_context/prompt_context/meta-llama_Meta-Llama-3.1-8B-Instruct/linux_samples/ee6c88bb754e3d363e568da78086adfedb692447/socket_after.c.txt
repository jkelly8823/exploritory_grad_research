 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-7558. The memcpy operation is copying a fixed-size struct (prim->ipaddr) into a fixed-size field (info->sctpi_p_address), which does not appear to be an out-of-bound read. Additionally, the other fields being copied are also fixed-size and do not appear to be susceptible to the same issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be safe from this vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is not vulnerable to other potential issues. Consider using a code review tool or having a peer review the code to catch any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-7558
CVE Description:
A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and sctp_get_sctp_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export
