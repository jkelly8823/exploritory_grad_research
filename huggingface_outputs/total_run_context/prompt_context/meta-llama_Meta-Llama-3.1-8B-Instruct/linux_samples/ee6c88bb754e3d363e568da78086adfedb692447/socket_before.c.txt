 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2017-7558. The memcpy function is used to copy the contents of the prim->ipaddr field into the info->sctpi_p_address field, which is a struct sockaddr_storage. The size of the struct sockaddr_storage is larger than the size of the prim->ipaddr field, so the memcpy function will not read past the end of the prim->ipaddr field. Additionally, the code does not appear to be accessing any kernel data structures in a way that would allow for an out-of-bound read.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be safe from the CVE-2017-7558 vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is not vulnerable to other potential issues.
