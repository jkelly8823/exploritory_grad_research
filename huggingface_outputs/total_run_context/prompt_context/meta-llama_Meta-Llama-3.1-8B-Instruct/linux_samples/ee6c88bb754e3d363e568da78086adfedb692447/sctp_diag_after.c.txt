 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8, 11-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the laddr and from structures to the info variable. However, the memset function is used to clear the remaining space in the info variable, but it does not account for the possibility of the slab data being larger than the space allocated for it. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a safer function like strncpy to copy the data from the laddr and from structures to the info variable.
2. Use a safer function like strlcpy to copy the data from the laddr and from structures to the info variable.
3. Use a safer function like snprintf to copy the data from the laddr and from structures to the info variable.
4. Use a safer function like memcpy_s to copy the data from the laddr and from structures to the info variable.
5. Use a safer function like memmove to copy the data from the laddr and from structures to the info variable.
6. Use
