 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability because it includes the unistd.h and sys/syscall.h headers which are not available in glibc versions prior to 2.30. This is a potential issue because the code is guarded by a conditional compilation directive that only includes these headers if the glibc version is 2.30 or later. However, the code does not check if the glibc version is actually 2.30 or later before including these headers. This could lead to a situation where the code is compiled with an older glibc version, and the headers are included, potentially causing issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the glibc version is 2.30 or later before including the unistd.h and sys/syscall.h headers.
2. Consider using a more robust method to handle the inclusion of headers based on the glibc version, such as using a feature test macro or a version-specific header.
