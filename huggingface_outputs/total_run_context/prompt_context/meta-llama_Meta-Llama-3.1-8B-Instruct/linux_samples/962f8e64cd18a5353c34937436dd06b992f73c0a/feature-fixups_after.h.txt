 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 959-960, 957-958, 951
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be vulnerable to a cache side-channel attack. The use of the.pushsection and.popsection directives in the code suggests that it is attempting to flush the cache, but the implementation is incomplete. The inclusion of the FTR_ENTRY_OFFSET macro in the code indicates that it is trying to fix up the entry points of the functions, but the fixup section is not properly aligned, which could allow an attacker to exploit the cache side-channel vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly align the fixup sections using the.align directive.
2. Ensure that the FTR_ENTRY_OFFSET macro is properly used to fix up the entry points of the functions.
3. Consider using a more secure method to flush the cache, such as using the clflush instruction. 
4. Review the code to ensure that it is properly handling the cache side-channel vulnerability.
