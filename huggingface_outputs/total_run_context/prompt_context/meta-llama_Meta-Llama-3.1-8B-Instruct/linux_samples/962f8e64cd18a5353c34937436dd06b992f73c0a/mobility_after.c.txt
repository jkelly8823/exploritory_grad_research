 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code sample is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability. This is because the code is executing the pseries_setup_security_mitigations() function, which could potentially allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid executing the pseries_setup_security_mitigations() function if it is not necessary for the system's operation.
2. If the function is necessary, ensure that it is executed in a secure environment where sensitive information is not accessible.
3. Consider using a secure alternative to the pseries_setup_security_mitigations() function that does not involve L1 cache operations.
