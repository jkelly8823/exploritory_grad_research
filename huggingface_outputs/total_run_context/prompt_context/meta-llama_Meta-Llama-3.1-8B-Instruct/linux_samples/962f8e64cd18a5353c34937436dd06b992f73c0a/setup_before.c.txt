 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a local information disclosure attack due to the potential for sensitive information to be obtained from the L1 cache. This is because the code does not properly clear the L1 cache, which could allow an attacker to access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clear the L1 cache properly before accessing sensitive data.
2. Use a secure method to clear the cache, such as using the `security_ftr_clear` function with the correct flags.
3. Consider using a cache flush function that is specifically designed to clear sensitive data from the cache.
