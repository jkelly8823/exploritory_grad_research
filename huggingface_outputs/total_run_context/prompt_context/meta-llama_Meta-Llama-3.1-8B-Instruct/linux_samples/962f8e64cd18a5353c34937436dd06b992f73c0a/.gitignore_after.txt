 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability via the L1 cache. The code appears to be a simple comment block with two function names, `rfi_flush` and `entry_flush`, which do not contain any executable code that could be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to ensure that the functions `rfi_flush` and `entry_flush` are properly implemented and do not contain any vulnerabilities in their implementation. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code for any potential security issues that may arise from the use of the `GPL-2.0-only` license.
