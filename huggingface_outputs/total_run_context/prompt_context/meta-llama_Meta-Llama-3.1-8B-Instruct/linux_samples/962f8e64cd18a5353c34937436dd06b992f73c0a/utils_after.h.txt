 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-4788 vulnerability because it uses the perf_event_disable and perf_event_reset functions which are not properly sanitized. This allows a local user to obtain sensitive information from the data in the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the glibc library to version 2.30 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure alternative to perf_event_disable and perf_event_reset functions.
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the perf_event_disable and perf_event_reset functions.
