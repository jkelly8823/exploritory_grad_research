 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a local user obtaining sensitive information from the L1 cache under extenuating circumstances. This is due to the use of the `PTRRELOC` function to relocate the start and end addresses of the fixup code. The `PTRRELOC` function is not secure and can be exploited by a local user to obtain sensitive information from the L1 cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure relocation function, such as `kasan_relocate`, to relocate the start and end addresses of the fixup code.
2. Use a secure method to protect the fixup code from being accessed by a local user, such as using a secure memory region or a secure page table entry.
3. Consider using a secure cache flush mechanism, such as the `clflush` instruction, to flush the L1 cache before accessing sensitive information.
