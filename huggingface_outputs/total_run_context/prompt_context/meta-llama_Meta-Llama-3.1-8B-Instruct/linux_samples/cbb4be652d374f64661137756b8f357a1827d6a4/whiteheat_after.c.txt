 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly validate the USB device's endpoint descriptors, allowing an attacker to potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the endpoint descriptors.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the USB device's endpoint descriptors before accessing them.
2. Use a secure method to access the endpoint descriptors, such as using a whitelist of allowed endpoint descriptors.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential attacks. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2015-5257
CVE Description:
drivers/usb/serial/whiteheat.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.4 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device.  NOTE: this ID was incorrectly used for an Apache Cordova issue that has the correct ID of CVE-2015-8320.  The correct CVE ID
