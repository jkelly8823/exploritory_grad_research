 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The acpi_get_sleep_type_data function is called with a pointer to a local variable, which is freed when the function returns. However, the function is called again with the same pointer in the next line, which can lead to a use-after-free error.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Change the line `status = acpi_get_sleep_type_data(i, &type_a, &type_b);` to `status = acpi_get_sleep_type_data(i, &type_a, &type_b);` to ensure that the pointer is not freed before it is used again.
2. Consider using a different data structure to store the sleep states, such as a dynamically allocated array, to avoid the use-after-free vulnerability. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code is not vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1797 vulnerability. The code does not use the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation, which is the operation that triggers the vulnerability.
