 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The nouveau_bo_tile_layout function is called on the old_mem object after it has been freed. This is because the RING_SPACE function is called on the old_mem object after it has been freed in the previous if statement. The nouveau_bo_tile_layout function is called on the old_mem object in the current if statement, which is after the old_mem object has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Move the nouveau_bo_tile_layout function call to before the RING_SPACE function call.
- Remove the nouveau_bo_tile_layout function call from the current if statement.
- Add a check to ensure that the old_mem object is not freed before the nouveau_bo_tile_layout function call.
