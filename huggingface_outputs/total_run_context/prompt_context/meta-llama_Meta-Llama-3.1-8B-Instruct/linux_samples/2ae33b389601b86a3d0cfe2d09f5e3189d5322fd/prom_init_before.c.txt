 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of a relocated pointer (__prom_init_toc_start) without proper synchronization. The __reloc_toc function is called twice, once with an offset and once without, which can lead to a situation where the pointer is used after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a lock to synchronize access to the relocated pointer.
2. Avoid using relocated pointers in critical sections of code.
3. Consider using a different data structure that does not require relocation. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted application.
