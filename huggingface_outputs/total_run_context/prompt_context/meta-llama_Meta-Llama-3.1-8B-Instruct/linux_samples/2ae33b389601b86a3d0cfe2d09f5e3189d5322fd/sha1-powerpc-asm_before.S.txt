 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a PowerPC assembly code snippet that handles stack frame management and register saving/restoring for a function named _GLOBAL(powerpc_sha_transform). The code does not involve any direct memory access or manipulation that could lead to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is clean and does not require any modifications to address the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code for any potential issues, especially when dealing with low-level assembly code.  ```bash
