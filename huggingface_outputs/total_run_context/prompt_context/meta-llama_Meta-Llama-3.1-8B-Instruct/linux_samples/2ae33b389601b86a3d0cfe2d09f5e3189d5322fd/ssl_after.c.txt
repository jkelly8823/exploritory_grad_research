 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The ssl_init and ssl_exit functions are serialized, but the ssl_install function is not. This means that the ssl_install function can be called after ssl_exit has freed the memory, but before ssl_init has reinitialized it. This can cause the ssl_install function to access freed memory, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The ssl_install function should be serialized with ssl_init and ssl_exit to prevent this vulnerability. This can be done by adding a lock or mutex to protect the ssl_install function, or by reordering the calls to ssl_init, ssl_exit, and ssl_install to ensure that ssl_install is only called after ssl_init has reinitialized the memory.

CVE Description:
Use-after-free vulnerability in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that triggers use of a guest physical address (GPA) in (
