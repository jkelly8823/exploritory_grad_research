 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 49
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The variable %g4 is used before it is initialized in the case where the CPU is unknown. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize the variable %g4 before using it. This can be done by adding a line to set %g4 to a default value before the unknown case. For example: mov SUN4V_CHIP_UNKNOWN, %g4 before the be,pt instruction.
