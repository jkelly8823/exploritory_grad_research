VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted
