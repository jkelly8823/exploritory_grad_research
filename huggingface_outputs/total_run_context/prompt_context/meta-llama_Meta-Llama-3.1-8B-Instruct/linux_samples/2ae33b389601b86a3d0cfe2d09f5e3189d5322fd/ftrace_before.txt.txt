 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a simple state machine that handles different input scenarios, allocating and deallocating memory as necessary. The use of a state machine and explicit memory management (e.g., free, swap, clear) suggests that the code is designed to prevent memory-related vulnerabilities such as use-after-free or buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any additional fixes. However, it may be beneficial to consider adding additional error handling or logging mechanisms to improve the code's robustness and maintainability. 

Note: The code sample provided is a simple table that describes the behavior of a state machine, rather than actual code that can be executed. The analysis is based on the description of the code's behavior rather than its implementation.  Please let me know if you need any further clarification or details.  Thank you.
