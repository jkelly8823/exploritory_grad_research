 
VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code snippet appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation, and it is handling the switching of the CPU to the identity mapping. The code does not contain any of the specific functions or operations mentioned in the vulnerability descriptions (ioapic_read_indirect, kvm_set_msr_common, etc.). Therefore, it is not vulnerable to the listed CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential security issues that may not be listed in the vulnerability list.  ``` Bash
