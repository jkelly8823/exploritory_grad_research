 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1797 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle the use of a guest physical address (GPA) in movable or removable memory during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME kvm_set_msr_common operation. Specifically, in the "allocated" state, the code swaps the memory, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the GPA is not used in movable or removable memory during the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation.
2. Implement proper memory management to prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities.
3. Consider using a more robust memory allocation strategy to prevent similar issues in the future.  ```bash

EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1798 or CVE-2013-1796 vulnerabilities. The code does not handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, nor does it fail to ensure a required time_page alignment during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM
