 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code sample contains a use-after-free vulnerability. The variable %r14 is used to store the address of __LC_MCCK_ENTER_TIMER, but later it is used to store the address of __LC_GPREGS_SAVE_AREA+64. This can lead to a situation where the contents of __LC_MCCK_ENTER_TIMER are overwritten, and then the contents of __LC_GPREGS_SAVE_AREA+64 are accessed, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the variables are not reused for storing different types of data.
2. Use a different variable to store the address of __LC_GPREGS_SAVE_AREA+64.
3. Use a pointer to a temporary variable to store the address of __LC_MCCK_ENTER_TIMER, and then use that pointer to access the contents of __LC_MCCK_ENTER_TIMER. This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability.
