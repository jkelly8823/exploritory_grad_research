 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. In the intel_pstate_exit function, the code frees the memory allocated for all_cpu_data using vfree() but then attempts to access it again in the following lines. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially cause a denial of service or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should be modified to ensure that all_cpu_data is not accessed after it has been freed. This can be achieved by moving the access to all_cpu_data before the vfree() call. Alternatively, a temporary copy of the data can be made before freeing the original memory. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1798 vulnerability. The ioapic_read_indirect function is not present in this code, and the vulnerability is specific to the Linux kernel.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
