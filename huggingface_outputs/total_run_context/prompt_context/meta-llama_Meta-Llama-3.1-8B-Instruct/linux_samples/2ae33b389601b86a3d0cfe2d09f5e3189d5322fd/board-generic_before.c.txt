 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2, 5-6
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a machine description for a specific OMAP processor. The suspected vulnerabilities are related to the handling of interrupts and timekeeping. The code appears to be vulnerable to CVE-2013-1797, as it uses a GPA in movable or removable memory during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation. Additionally, the code may be vulnerable to CVE-2013-1796, as it does not ensure a required time_page alignment during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation. However, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to CVE-2013-1798, as it does not handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the GPA is not used in movable or removable memory during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation.
2. Verify that the time_page is properly aligned during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation.
3. Review the code to ensure that it handles invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations correctly.
