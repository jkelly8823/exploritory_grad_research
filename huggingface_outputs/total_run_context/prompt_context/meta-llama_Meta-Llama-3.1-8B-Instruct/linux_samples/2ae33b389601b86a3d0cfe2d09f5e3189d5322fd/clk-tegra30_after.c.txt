 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a series of clock duplication operations using the TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE macro, which does not seem to be related to the vulnerabilities listed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is clean and does not contain any of the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it is properly tested before deployment.  The code should also be reviewed for any potential security issues that may not be listed in the vulnerability list. 

Note: The code sample provided is a snippet from the Linux kernel source code. The TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE macro is used to duplicate clock sources in the Tegra SoC. The code is likely used to configure the clocking system for the SoC.
