 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the CVE descriptions. The code appears to be a part of the Linux kernel's DRM driver for Intel graphics, and it handles interrupt processing and clearing of interrupt registers. The code does not contain any obvious use-after-free vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, or other issues that would allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted application.
