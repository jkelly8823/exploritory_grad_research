 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a configuration file for a Linux kernel, specifically dealing with board support for the SOM5282EM module. The code does not contain any direct references to the vulnerabilities listed (CVE-2013-1798, CVE-2013-1797, CVE-2013-1796), which are related to the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) functionality. The code is focused on board support and configuration options, making it unlikely to be vulnerable to these specific issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. However, it is essential to ensure that the Linux kernel version being used is up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Additionally, proper configuration and testing of the board support should be performed to ensure its functionality and security.  ```bash
