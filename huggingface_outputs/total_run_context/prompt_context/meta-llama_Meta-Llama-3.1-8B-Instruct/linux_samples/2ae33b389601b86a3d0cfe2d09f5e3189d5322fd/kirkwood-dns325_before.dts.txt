 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a device tree blob (DTB) file, which is a data structure used to describe hardware components and their configurations. The code snippet provided does not contain any C code or kernel-level functionality, and therefore does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVEs listed. The code is primarily composed of device tree nodes and properties, which are used to describe the hardware configuration of a system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any C code or kernel-level functionality, and therefore does not require any fixes or modifications. However, it is recommended to ensure that the device tree blob is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential issues with the system's hardware configuration.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host
