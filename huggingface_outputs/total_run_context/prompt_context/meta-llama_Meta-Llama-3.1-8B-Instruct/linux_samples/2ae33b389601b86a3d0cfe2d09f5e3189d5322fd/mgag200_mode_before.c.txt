 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a simple validation function for a display mode, and it does not involve any of the vulnerable functions or operations mentioned in the vulnerability list.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is clean and does not require any modifications. However, the FIXME comment suggests that additional validation may be necessary to ensure that the display mode meets the bandwidth and g200se limitations. This should be addressed in a future update.  ```bash
