 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1796 vulnerability. The kvm_set_msr_common function is called, but the time_page is not checked for alignment before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow and host OS memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the time_page is properly aligned before using it.
2. Check the alignment of the time_page before passing it to the kvm_set_msr_common function.
3. Use a safe function to allocate the time_page, such as kmalloc, to ensure that it is properly aligned. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:

CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted application.
