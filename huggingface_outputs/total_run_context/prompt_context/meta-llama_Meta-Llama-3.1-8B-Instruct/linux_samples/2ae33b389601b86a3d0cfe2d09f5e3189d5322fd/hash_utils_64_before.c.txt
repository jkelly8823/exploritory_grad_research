 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The variable "pgdir" is set to "mm->pgd" which is a pointer to a page directory. However, the code does not check if the page directory is still valid before using it. If the page directory is freed or modified after it is set, the code will access freed memory, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the page directory is still valid before using it.
2. Use a reference count or a lock to protect the page directory from being freed or modified while it is in use.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a pointer to a page directory entry, to avoid the use-after-free vulnerability. 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1798 vulnerability. The ioapic_read_indirect function is not present in this code, and the code does not appear to handle IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations.
