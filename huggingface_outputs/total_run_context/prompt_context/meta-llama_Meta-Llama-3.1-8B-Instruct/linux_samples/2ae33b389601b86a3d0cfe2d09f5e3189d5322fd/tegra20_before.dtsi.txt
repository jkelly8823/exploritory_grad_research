 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a device tree blob (DTB) that describes the hardware configuration of a system. It includes nodes for the timer and interrupt controller, which are compatible with the specified ARM Cortex-A9 devices. However, there is no indication of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list, such as the ioapic_read_indirect function or the kvm_set_msr_common function, which are related to the Linux kernel and not directly related to the device tree blob. Therefore, the code sample is not vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample is a device tree blob and does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the device tree blob is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the system is running a secure and up-to-date version of the Linux kernel. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
