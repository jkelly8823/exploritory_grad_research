 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a part of a device tree binding for a PMC (Power Management Controller) on a Tegra SoC. It defines a set of clock duplicates and a device tree match table. The code does not involve any of the vulnerable functions or operations mentioned in the vulnerability list.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is secure and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues or vulnerabilities specific to the device tree binding and the PMC implementation. 

Note: The code sample is a part of a larger device tree binding, and the provided snippet might not be the only relevant code. A thorough review of the entire codebase is recommended. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain
