 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The mm_context_t struct is defined twice, once with a field 'id' and once without. This can lead to a situation where the 'id' field is accessed after it has been freed, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the duplicate definition of the mm_context_t struct.
2. Ensure that the 'id' field is not accessed after it has been freed.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure to store the context information.
