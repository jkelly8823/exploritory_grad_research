 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a device tree blob (DTB) that describes the hardware configuration of a system. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the CVEs. The code is written in a device tree syntax, which is a data structure used to describe the hardware components of a system. It does not contain any executable code or functions that could be exploited by the vulnerabilities listed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. However, it is recommended to ensure that the device tree is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential issues. Additionally, it is recommended to follow best practices for secure coding and to keep the device tree up-to-date with the latest security patches.
