 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any direct references to the vulnerabilities listed. However, the code does define a set of constants for different ALPS protocol versions. This could potentially be used in conjunction with other code to implement the vulnerable functions mentioned in the CVEs. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the full extent of the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code that uses these constants to ensure that it does not implement the vulnerable functions.
- Consider adding additional checks or validation to prevent misuse of these constants.
