 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a part of the ARM architecture's CPU switching mechanism. It is checking for the presence of an MMU (Memory Management Unit) and performing some operations related to the ASID (Address Space Identifier) and TTB (Translation Table Base). The code does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs, as it does not involve the ioapic_read_indirect function, guest physical addresses, or MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operations. The code is specific to the ARM architecture and does not seem to be related to the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any modifications. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations
