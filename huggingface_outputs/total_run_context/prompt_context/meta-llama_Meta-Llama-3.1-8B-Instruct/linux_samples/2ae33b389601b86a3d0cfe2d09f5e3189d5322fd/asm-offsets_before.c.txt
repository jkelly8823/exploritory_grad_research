 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a snippet of kernel code that defines various macros for use in the kernel. The BLANK() macro is used to insert blank lines in the code, and the DEFINE() macro is used to define various constants. There is no indication of any use-after-free or buffer overflow vulnerabilities in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. 

Note: The code sample provided does not contain any code that would be vulnerable to the CVEs listed.
