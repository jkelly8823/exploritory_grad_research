 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability. The mutex_unlock(&dpm_list_mtx) call is made before the dev_pm_qos_constraints_destroy(dev) call, which can lead to a situation where the dev_pm_qos_constraints_destroy(dev) call is executed after the mutex has been unlocked, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the mutex_unlock(&dpm_list_mtx) call to after the dev_pm_qos_constraints_destroy(dev) call to prevent the use-after-free vulnerability.
2. Consider using a lock to protect the dev_pm_qos_constraints_destroy(dev) call to ensure that it is executed after the mutex has been locked. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1797
CVE Description:
Use-after-free vulnerability in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that triggers use of a guest physical address (GPA) in (1) movable or (2) removable memory during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME
