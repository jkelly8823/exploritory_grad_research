 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code defines a set of constants for ADPA (Advanced Display Port Analyzer) control and status registers, but it does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is clean and does not require any modifications to address the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it meets the required functionality and security standards. 

Note: The code sample provided is a set of macro definitions and does not contain any executable code. Therefore, it is not possible to identify any vulnerabilities in the code. The analysis is based on the provided code sample and the vulnerability list. 

Please let me know if you need any further assistance. I'll be happy to help.
