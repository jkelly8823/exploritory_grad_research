 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample does not appear to contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code is checking if a chip select is enabled by checking the least significant bit of the size variable. If it is enabled, it then proceeds to update the cs_index of a struct mbus_dram_window. This does not appear to be related to the vulnerabilities listed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any of the listed vulnerabilities.
