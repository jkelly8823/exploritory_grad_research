 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of the `toc_entry` pointer after it has been incremented. The `toc_entry` pointer is incremented in the for loop, but it is not reassigned or reset to point to the beginning of the TOC array. As a result, the `toc_entry` pointer points to an invalid memory location after the loop, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Reassign the `toc_entry` pointer to point to the beginning of the TOC array after the loop.
2. Use a more robust method to iterate over the TOC array, such as using an index variable instead of incrementing the pointer directly.
3. Consider using a safer method to access the TOC array, such as using a bounds-checked array access function.
