 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code provided does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. The code appears to be a part of a Linux kernel driver for a specific SoC (System-on-Chip) and deals with clock management. The code does not seem to handle any indirect IOAPIC operations, MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operations, or time_page alignment, which are the main concerns of the provided CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, and no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and ensure that it follows the best practices for secure coding. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential issues related to the specific SoC and its architecture.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS
