VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any of the suspected vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a part of a Linux kernel configuration, specifically related to the Metag user TCM (Translation Control Mechanism) configuration. The code defines constants for ELF platform and stack randomization mask, and includes a conditional compilation directive for the Metag user TCM configuration. None of the suspected vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-1798, CVE-2013-1797, CVE-2013-1796) are related to this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any modifications. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire Linux kernel configuration to ensure that all necessary security measures are in place. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive
