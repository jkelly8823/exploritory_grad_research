EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a set of macro definitions for interrupt handling in a network processor. It defines a range of interrupt numbers and provides macros for accessing specific interrupts. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs (CVE-2013-1798, CVE-2013-1797, CVE-2013-1796). The code is focused on interrupt handling and does not involve the use of indirect IOAPIC operations, MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operations, or other features that are relevant to the identified vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any fixes. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, consider using static analysis tools to identify potential issues that may not be immediately apparent.  ```
