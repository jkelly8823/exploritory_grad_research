 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of the page pointer after it has been freed. This is because the page pointer is not checked for validity before it is used in the __alloc_from_contiguous and __alloc_remap_buffer functions. If the page pointer is freed before it is used, it will point to freed memory, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the validity of the page pointer before using it.
2. Use a safer function that checks for page validity, such as __alloc_pages_exact.
3. Avoid using the page pointer after it has been freed. Instead, use a new page pointer or re-allocate the memory if necessary. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of
