 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample does not appear to contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code is a series of clock duplication operations using the TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE macro, which does not seem to be related to the vulnerabilities described in the list.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any of the listed vulnerabilities, so no recommendations are necessary. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues or security vulnerabilities.
