 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability.
The vulnerability is due to the fact that the OPP library is not properly
handling the removal of OPP information. The code is using a pointer to a
struct opp_info without checking if the pointer is valid before accessing it.
This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability when the OPP information is
removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Check if the pointer to the struct opp_info is valid before accessing it.
2.  Use a safe pointer to access the struct opp_info.
3.  Properly handle the removal of OPP information to prevent use-after-free
    vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted application.
