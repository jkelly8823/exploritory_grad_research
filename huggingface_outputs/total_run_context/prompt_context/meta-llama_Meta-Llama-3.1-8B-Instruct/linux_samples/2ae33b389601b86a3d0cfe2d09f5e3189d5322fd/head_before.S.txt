 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to the CVE-2013-1798 vulnerability. This is because the code does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations. The code is attempting to set the bottom and top PGD entry bits, but it does not check if the current PGD entry is valid before doing so. This can lead to sensitive information being obtained from host OS memory or a denial of service (host OS OOPS) being caused.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a check to ensure that the current PGD entry is valid before setting the bottom and top PGD entry bits.
2. Implement proper error handling for invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations.
3. Consider using a more secure method to handle PGD entry bits, such as using a separate function to handle this operation.
