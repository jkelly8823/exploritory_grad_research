 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not appear to contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code is focused on defining bitmasks and interrupt-related constants, and does not involve any of the specific functions or operations mentioned in the vulnerability descriptions (e.g. ioapic_read_indirect, kvm_set_msr_common, etc.).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample appears to be secure and does not require any fixes. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets the required security standards. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1798
CVE Description:
The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted application.
CVE_ID:CVE-2013-1797
CVE Description:
Use-after-free vulnerability in arch/x86/k
