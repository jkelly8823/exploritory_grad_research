 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code appears to be a series of function declarations and conditional compilation directives, and does not contain any code that could potentially lead to the exploitation of the listed vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code is free of the listed vulnerabilities and does not require any modifications to address these issues. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it meets the required functionality and security standards. 

Note: The code sample provided is a snippet from the Linux kernel source code. The vulnerabilities listed are actual vulnerabilities that were present in the Linux kernel at some point in time. The code sample is not intended to be a realistic example of code that would be vulnerable to these issues. It is simply a snippet of code that does not contain any of the listed vulnerabilities.  ```c
