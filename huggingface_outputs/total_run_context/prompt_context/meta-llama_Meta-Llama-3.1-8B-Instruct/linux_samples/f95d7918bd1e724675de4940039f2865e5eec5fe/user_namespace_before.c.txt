VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8989. The code checks for a specific condition where a new mapping is created with a single extent and a count of 1, and then checks if the new mapping's ID matches the effective user ID of the file's credentials. This is a valid check to prevent unprivileged mappings, and does not contain the "negative groups" issue described in the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure against the described vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets all security requirements.  Further review of the code and its context is recommended to ensure it is secure against other potential vulnerabilities.  Additionally, the code could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of the conditional check.  This would improve code readability and maintainability.  Consider adding a comment to explain the condition being checked.  For example:  /* Check for a single, unprivileged mapping */.  This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.  It is also a good practice to use more descriptive variable names, such as "
