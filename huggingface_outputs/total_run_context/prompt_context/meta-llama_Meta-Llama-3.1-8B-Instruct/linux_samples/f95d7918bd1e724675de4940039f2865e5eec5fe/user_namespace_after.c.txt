 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any code that would allow a local user to bypass intended file permissions by leveraging a POSIX ACL containing an entry for the group category that is more restrictive than the entry for the other category. The code checks for the condition where the new_map has only one extent with a count of 1 and the owner of the user namespace matches the effective user ID of the credential. If this condition is met, it checks if the new_map's lower_first extent matches the effective user ID of the credential. However, this check is done in the context of setting the user ID, not the group ID, which is the vulnerability described in the CVE. Therefore, this code snippet does not contain the vulnerability described in the CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain the vulnerability described in the CVE. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire kernel to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-8989
