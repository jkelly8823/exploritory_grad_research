 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code. However, based on the description of the vulnerability, it appears that the code is related to exception handling. The x86_decode_insn function is mentioned, which is a function in the Linux kernel that handles instruction decoding. The vulnerability is related to a ModR/M byte in an undefined instruction, which could potentially cause a denial of service. However, without the actual code, it is difficult to determine if the vulnerability is present.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Review the code for any undefined instructions or ModR/M bytes that could potentially cause a denial of service.
- Ensure that the code is properly handling exceptions and undefined instructions.
- Consider using a code review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000116
CVE Description:
The vulnerability exists due to the fact that the `get_user` function does not properly validate the user input. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

Code Sample:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    get_user(buffer, 10);
