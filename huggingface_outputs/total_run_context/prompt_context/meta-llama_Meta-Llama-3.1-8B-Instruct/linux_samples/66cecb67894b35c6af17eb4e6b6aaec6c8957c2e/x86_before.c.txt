 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) due to a certain use of a ModR/M byte in an undefined instruction. This is because the x86_decode_insn function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, when KVM is enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a certain use of a ModR/M byte in an undefined instruction.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.8.7 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using undefined instructions.
3. Implement additional security measures to prevent local users from causing a denial of service (host OS crash). 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000251
CVE Description:
The KVM hypervisor in QEMU before 2.10.0 allows local users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted MSR write operation.

Code Sample:

static int kvm_msr_write(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct msr_data *
