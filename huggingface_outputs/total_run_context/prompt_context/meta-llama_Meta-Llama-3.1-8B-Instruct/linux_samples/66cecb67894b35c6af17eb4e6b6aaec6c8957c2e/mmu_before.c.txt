 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) due to the use of a ModR/M byte in an undefined instruction. This is a known vulnerability in the x86_decode_insn function in the Linux kernel. The code attempts to decode an instruction, but it does not properly handle the ModR/M byte, leading to a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.8.7 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Use a secure coding practice to properly handle the ModR/M byte in the x86_decode_insn function.
3. Implement additional error handling to prevent the denial of service attack. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2017-1000253
CVE Description:
The Linux kernel before 4.13.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a crafted application that triggers a large number of page faults, leading to a race condition between the oom killer and the page fault handler.

Code Sample:

	struct page *page = find_get_page(mapping, index);
	if (!page) {
		if (mapping_writable
