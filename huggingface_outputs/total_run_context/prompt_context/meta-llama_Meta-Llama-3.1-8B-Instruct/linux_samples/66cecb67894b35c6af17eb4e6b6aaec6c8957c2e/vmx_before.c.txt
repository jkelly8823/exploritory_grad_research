 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (host OS crash) via a certain use of a ModR/M byte in an undefined instruction. This is due to the x86_decode_insn function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, when KVM is enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the Linux kernel to version 4.8.7 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Disable KVM if possible.
3. Use a secure coding practice to avoid using undefined instructions.
4. Implement a mechanism to detect and prevent the use of undefined instructions. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2016-8630
CVE Description:
The x86_decode_insn function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, when KVM is enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a certain use of a ModR/M byte in an undefined instruction.  This vulnerability is a result of the x86_decode_insn function not properly handling undefined instructions, which can lead to a
