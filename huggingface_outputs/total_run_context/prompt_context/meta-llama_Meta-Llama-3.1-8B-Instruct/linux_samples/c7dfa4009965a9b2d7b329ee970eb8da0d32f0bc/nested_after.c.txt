 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3656 because it does not properly validate the "virt_ext" field when processing the VMCB provided by the L1 guest. This allows a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS for the L2 guest, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the "virt_ext" field properly before processing the VMCB.
2. Use a secure method to handle the VMCB, such as using a whitelist of allowed values for the "virt_ext" field.
3. Consider using a more secure virtualization framework that is not vulnerable to this issue.  ```bash
