 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any code that directly relates to the CVE-2021-3656 vulnerability. The vulnerability is related to the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization, specifically the handling of the "virt_ext" field in the VMCB. The provided code snippet appears to be related to handling SMI (System Management Interrupt) intercepts, which is a different aspect of KVM's SVM functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the CVE-2021-3656 vulnerability. However, it is essential to ensure that any code related to SVM nested virtualization is properly validated and handled to prevent potential vulnerabilities. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2021-44228
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the MSR (Model-Specific Register) write operation. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the host by writing to the MSR register with an invalid value.

Code Sample:
	/* MSR write handler */
	static int kvm_msr_write(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
