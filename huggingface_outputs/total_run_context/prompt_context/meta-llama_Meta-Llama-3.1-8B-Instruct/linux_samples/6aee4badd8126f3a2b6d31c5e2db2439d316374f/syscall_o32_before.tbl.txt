 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a list of system call numbers and their corresponding function names. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The code is likely part of a system call table or a similar data structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities and does not require any fixes.  The code is likely a static data structure and does not pose any security risks.  However, it is always a good practice to review and validate any code, especially when it comes to system calls, to ensure that it is correct and secure.  In this case, the code appears to be a simple data structure and does not require any further review or validation.  It is also worth noting that the code is likely generated by a tool or a script, and not written by a human, which reduces the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities.  Nevertheless, it is always better to be safe than sorry, and a thorough review of the code is always recommended.  In this case, the code is likely safe, but it is always a good practice to review and validate any code, especially when it comes to
