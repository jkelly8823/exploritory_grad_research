 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of the Linux kernel source code, specifically dealing with system call numbers and their corresponding functions. The code does not seem to be related to any of the vulnerabilities listed in the vulnerability list. The system call numbers and function names suggest a low-level, kernel-level implementation, which is not typically associated with the types of vulnerabilities described in the list (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, or container-related issues).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to the listed CVEs. However, it is essential to note that this analysis is limited to the provided code snippet and may not cover the entire kernel codebase. A thorough review of the kernel code is necessary to ensure the absence of vulnerabilities.
