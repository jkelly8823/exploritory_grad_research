 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges. This is due to the lack of proper validation of the path in the ns_get_path function.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the path in the ns_get_path function to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Use a secure method to handle the path, such as using a whitelist of allowed directories.
- Consider using a library that provides secure path handling, such as libpath. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-15664
CVE Description:
In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot). 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-5736
CVE Description:
runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and
