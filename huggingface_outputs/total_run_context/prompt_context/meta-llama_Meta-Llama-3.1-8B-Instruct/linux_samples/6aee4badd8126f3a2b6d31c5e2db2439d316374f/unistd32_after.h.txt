 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided is vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges. This is because the code is using the __SYSCALL macro to define system calls, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to the host filesystem.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the code to use a secure method for defining system calls, such as using a whitelist of allowed system calls.
- Implement additional security measures to prevent symlink-exchange attacks, such as checking the validity of file paths before accessing them.
- Consider using a sandboxed environment to isolate the system calls from the host filesystem. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2018-15664
CVE Description:
In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).
