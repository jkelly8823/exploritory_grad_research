 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code sample appears to be a snippet from a Linux kernel source code, specifically from the syscalls table. It lists three system calls: sys_fspick, sys_pidfd_open, and __sys_clone3. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to the provided CVEs. The code is likely a part of the Linux kernel's syscall implementation and does not seem to be related to the vulnerabilities described in the CVEs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not appear to be vulnerable to the described CVEs. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure it meets the required security standards. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential security issues specific to the Linux kernel or the syscalls implementation.
