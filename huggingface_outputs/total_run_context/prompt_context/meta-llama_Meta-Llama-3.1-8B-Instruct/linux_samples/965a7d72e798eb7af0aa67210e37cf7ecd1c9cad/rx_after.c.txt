 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 20-22
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to the CVE-2020-26147 vulnerability. This is because the code reassembles fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. The specific lines that are vulnerable are 14-16 and 20-22, where the code checks if the key is set and if the frame is protected, and then proceeds to reassemble the fragments.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the frame is protected before reassembling the fragments. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the frame is protected before proceeding to reassemble the fragments.
2. Ensure that the fragments are not reassembled if they are sent in plaintext. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the fragments are not sent in plaintext before reassembling them.
3. Implement a mechanism to verify that the next fragment has a sequential PN value before reassembling the fragments. This can be done by
