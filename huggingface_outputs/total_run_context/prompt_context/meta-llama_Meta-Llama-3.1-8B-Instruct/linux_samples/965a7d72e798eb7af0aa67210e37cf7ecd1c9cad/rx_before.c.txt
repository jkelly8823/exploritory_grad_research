 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2020-26147 because it reassembles fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This allows an attacker to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the fragment is sent in plaintext before reassembling it.
2. If the fragment is sent in plaintext, drop it and do not reassemble it.
3. Consider using a more secure protocol, such as AES, to encrypt the fragments. 
4. Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of the fragments before reassembling them. 
5. Update the code to handle fragmented frames more securely. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2020-26147
CVE Description:
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or
