 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (stack memory consumption) due to recursive pagefault handling. This is because the ecryptfs_privileged_open function does not properly handle crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper error handling for crafted mmap calls.
2. Use a more secure method to handle pagefaults, such as using a separate thread or process.
3. Consider using a more secure file system, such as ext4 or xfs, which are less prone to vulnerabilities like this.  ```bash
