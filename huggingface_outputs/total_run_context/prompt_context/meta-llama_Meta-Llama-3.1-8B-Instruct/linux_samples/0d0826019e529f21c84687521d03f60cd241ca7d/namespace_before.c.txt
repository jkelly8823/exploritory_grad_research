 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop) via. (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call. However, the provided code sample does not contain the pivot_root system call. It appears to be a separate function that handles the preparation of the new root and old mount points. Therefore, it is not vulnerable to this specific CVE.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain the pivot_root system call, so it is not vulnerable to this CVE. However, it is still good practice to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested to prevent any potential issues.  ```c
int is_path_reachable(struct path *old_mnt, struct dentry *old_dentry, struct path *new)
{
    struct path *tmp;
    int ret = 0;

    if (old_mnt->dentry == old_dentry) {
        ret = 1;
    } else {
        tmp = old_mnt;
        while
