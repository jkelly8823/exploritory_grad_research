 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (mount-tree loop) due to the pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel. This is because the pivot_root system call does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory. The code attempts to detach the mount points of new_mnt and root_mnt, but it does not check if the new_mnt is below the root. This can cause a mount-tree loop if the new_mnt is not below the root.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the new_mnt is below the root before detaching the mount points.
2. Use a more robust method to detach the mount points, such as using the mount_lock to prevent concurrent access.
3. Consider using a different approach to pivot_root, such as using the pivot_root system call with the correct arguments. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2014-7970
CVE Description:
The pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of
