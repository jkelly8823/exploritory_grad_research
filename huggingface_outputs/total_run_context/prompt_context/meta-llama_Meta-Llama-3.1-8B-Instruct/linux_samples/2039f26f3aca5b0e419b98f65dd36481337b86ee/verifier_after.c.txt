 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) Variant 4 due to the presence of speculative execution and memory reads before the addresses of all prior memory writes are known. This vulnerability is present in the lines where the code checks for speculative execution and sanitizes the stack spill.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Use a non-speculative execution model to prevent the vulnerability.
2.  Ensure that all memory reads are performed after the addresses of all prior memory writes are known.
3.  Implement additional security measures to prevent side-channel attacks.
4.  Regularly update and patch the system to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.  VULNERABILITY LIST:
