 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
EXPLANATION:
The code sample provided does not contain any code that directly relates to the vulnerabilities listed. The code appears to be a snippet from the Linux kernel configuration file, specifically dealing with hardening options and compiler flags. The vulnerabilities listed (CVE-2019-2215 and CVE-2019-2025) are related to the binder.c file in the Android kernel, which is not present in this code sample.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code sample does not contain any code that could potentially introduce the listed vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to review the Linux kernel configuration and ensure that the hardening options are properly enabled and configured to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the kernel and compiler up-to-date to ensure that any known vulnerabilities are patched.  VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-2215
CVE Description:
A use-after-free in binder.c allows an elevation of privilege from an application to the Linux Kernel. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, however exploitation does require either the installation of a malicious local application or a separate vulnerability in a network facing application.Product: AndroidAndroid ID: A
