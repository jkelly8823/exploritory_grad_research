 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free vulnerability due to the improper locking in the binder_thread_read function. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. The code is also vulnerable to a list corruption vulnerability due to the lack of proper locking in the list_add and list_del functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Properly lock the binder_thread_read function to prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities.
2. Implement proper locking in the list_add and list_del functions to prevent list corruption vulnerabilities.
3. Enable CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED to harden the list implementation and prevent corruption vulnerabilities.

CVE Description:
A use-after-free in binder.c allows an elevation of privilege from an application to the Linux Kernel. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, however exploitation does require either the installation of a malicious local application or a separate vulnerability in a network facing application.Product: AndroidAndroid ID: A-141720095
