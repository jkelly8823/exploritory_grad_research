VULNERABLE_LINES: 34, 45
EXPLANATION:
The code provided is a part of the Linux kernel's list implementation. The suspected vulnerabilities are CVE-2019-2215 and CVE-2019-2025. CVE-2019-2215 is a use-after-free vulnerability in binder.c, which can lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel. CVE-2019-2025 is a use-after-free vulnerability in binder_thread_read of binder.c, which can also lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel. The code provided does not directly contain the vulnerable functions, but it does contain functions that perform list corruption checks before adding or deleting entries from a list. The functions __list_add_valid and __list_del_entry_valid contain checks for list corruption, but they do not appear to be vulnerable to the use-after-free vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVEs. However, the code does contain a potential vulnerability in the form of a use-after-free in the WRITE_ONCE(list->prev, list); statement. This statement is not protected by any checks for list corruption, and it could potentially lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the list is corrupted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should be
