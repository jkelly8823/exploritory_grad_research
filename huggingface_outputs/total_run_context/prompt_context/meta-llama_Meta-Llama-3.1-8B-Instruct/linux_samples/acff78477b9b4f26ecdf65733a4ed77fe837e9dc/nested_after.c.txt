 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-3887 because it allows a guest to access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled. This is due to the fact that the code does not properly handle x2APIC MSR access with nested virtualization enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the value of 'virtualize x2APIC mode' before enabling intercepts for the x2APIC MSR range.
2. Properly handle x2APIC MSR access with nested virtualization enabled by disabling intercepts for the x2APIC MSR range when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled.
3. Use a more secure approach to handle MSR access, such as using a separate MSR bitmap for L1 and L0. 

VULNERABILITY LIST: 
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3887
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific Rregister (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest could access L
