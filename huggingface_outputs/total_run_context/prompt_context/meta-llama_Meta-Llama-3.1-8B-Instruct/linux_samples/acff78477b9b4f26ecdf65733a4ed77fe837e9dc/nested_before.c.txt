 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to CVE-2019-3887 because it does not properly handle x2APIC MSR access with nested virtualization enabled. The code allows a guest to access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, which can lead to a potential crash of the host kernel resulting in a DoS issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check if the 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled before accessing L0's APIC register values.
2. Use proper error handling to prevent access to L0's APIC register values when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is not enabled.
3. Consider using a more secure approach to handle MSR access, such as using a separate MSR bitmap for L0 and L1. 

VULNERABILITY LIST:
CVE_ID:CVE-2019-3887
CVE Description:
A flaw was found in the way KVM hypervisor handled x2APIC Machine Specific Rregister (MSR) access with nested(=1) virtualization enabled. In that, L1 guest could access L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when '
