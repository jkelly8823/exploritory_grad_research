 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data. The crng_fast_load function is called before the seed is sufficiently generated, which could allow programs to use the data allocated for the seed before it is ready. This is a known issue in kernel drivers before version 4.17-rc1.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the kernel to version 4.17-rc1 or later to fix the vulnerability.
2. Implement additional checks to ensure that the seed is sufficiently generated before using it.
3. Consider using a more secure random number generator.

CVE_ID:CVE-2018-1108
CVE Description:
kernel drivers before version 4.17-rc1 are vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed data. Programs, early in the boot sequence, could use the data allocated for the seed before it was sufficiently generated.  VULNERABLE: YES
