VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the `for` loop on line 7. The loop iterates through the `buf` array, potentially overwriting memory beyond its bounds. The `b` variable is decremented by `sizeof(__u32)` in each iteration, but it's not guaranteed that `b` will always be greater than
