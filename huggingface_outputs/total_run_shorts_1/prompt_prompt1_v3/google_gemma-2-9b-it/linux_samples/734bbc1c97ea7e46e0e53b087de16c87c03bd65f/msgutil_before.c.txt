VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `min(len, DATALEN_MSG)` function call determines the size of the allocated buffer. However, if `len` is larger than `DATALEN_MSG`, the allocated buffer size will be truncated to `DATALEN_MSG`. This truncation could lead to
