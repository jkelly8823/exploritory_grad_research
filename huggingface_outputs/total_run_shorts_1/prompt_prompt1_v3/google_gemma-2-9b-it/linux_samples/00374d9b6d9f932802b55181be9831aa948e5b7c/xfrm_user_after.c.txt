VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function is used without bounds checking. This means that if `xfrm_replay_state_esn_len(replay_esn)` returns a value larger than the size of `x->replay_esn`, a buffer overflow will occur. A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space
