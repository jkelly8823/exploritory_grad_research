VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet performs a memcpy operation without verifying the size of the destination buffer (`x->replay_esn`). This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source data (`replay_esn`) is larger than the destination buffer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the size of the destination buffer (`x->replay_esn
