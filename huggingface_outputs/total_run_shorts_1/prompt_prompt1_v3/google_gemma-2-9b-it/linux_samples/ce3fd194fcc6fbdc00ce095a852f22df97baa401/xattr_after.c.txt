VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the size of an entry's value (`size`) is greater than `INT_MAX`. If it is, it returns an error. However, the code does not handle the case where `size` is less than 0. If `size` is negative, it could potentially lead to an integer overflow
