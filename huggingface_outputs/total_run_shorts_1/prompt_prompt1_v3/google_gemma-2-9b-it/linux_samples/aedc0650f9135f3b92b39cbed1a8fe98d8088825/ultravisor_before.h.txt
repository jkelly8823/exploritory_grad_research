VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The function `ucall_norets` is called without any prior checks or guarantees that the memory it operates on is valid. This could lead to a scenario where the memory has already been freed, resulting in a crash or unexpected behavior.
