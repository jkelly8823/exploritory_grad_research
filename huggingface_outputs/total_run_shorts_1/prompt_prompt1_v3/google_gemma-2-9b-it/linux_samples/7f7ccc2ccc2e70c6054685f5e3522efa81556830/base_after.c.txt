VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7, 11, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly calls `access_remote_vm` with potentially unvalidated input (`count`, `len`, `page`). This function appears to read data from a remote memory location. Without proper bounds checking, it's possible to provide input values that exceed the intended buffer size,
