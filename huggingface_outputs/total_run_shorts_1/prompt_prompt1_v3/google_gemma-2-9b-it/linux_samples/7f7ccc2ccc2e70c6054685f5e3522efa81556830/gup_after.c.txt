VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for write permissions on a virtual memory area (vma). However, the check for `VM_WRITE` flag is not comprehensive. If an attacker can manipulate the `vm_flags` variable to include additional flags that might bypass the check, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
