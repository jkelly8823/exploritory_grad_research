VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for write permissions (`vm_flags & VM_WRITE`) before allowing a write operation. However, the absence of bounds checking on the data being written could lead to a buffer overflow if the data exceeds the allocated buffer size.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement bounds checking on the data being written
