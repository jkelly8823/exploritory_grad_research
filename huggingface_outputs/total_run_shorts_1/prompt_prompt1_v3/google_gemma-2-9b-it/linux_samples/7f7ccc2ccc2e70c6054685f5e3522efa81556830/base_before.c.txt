VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7, 11, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly calls `access_remote_vm` with potentially unvalidated input values for `p`, `page`, and `this_len`. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads if these values are not properly sanitized or checked against the bounds
