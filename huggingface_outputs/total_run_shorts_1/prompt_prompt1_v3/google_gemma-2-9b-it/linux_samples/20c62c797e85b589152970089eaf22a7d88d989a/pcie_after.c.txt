VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability.  The line `dev_kfree_skb_any(skb);` frees the `skb` memory. However, subsequent lines attempt to access `skb` (e.g., `skb->dev`) after it has been freed. This can
