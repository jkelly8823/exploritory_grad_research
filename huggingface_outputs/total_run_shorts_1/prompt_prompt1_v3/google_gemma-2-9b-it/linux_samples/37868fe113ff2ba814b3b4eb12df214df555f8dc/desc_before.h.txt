VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: NULL Pointer Dereference
EXPLANATION:
The function `set_ldt` is being called with a NULL pointer as the first argument. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior when the function attempts to dereference the NULL pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Check if the `pc->ldt` pointer is NULL before calling `set_ldt`.
