VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the size of the gap ACK blocks (`glen`) is greater than the data length (`dlen`). If it is, the code breaks. However, there is no check to ensure that `glen` is within the bounds of the available buffer space. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `glen` is
