VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. The variable `new_member_cnt` is compared against `MAX_MON_DOMAIN` without any bounds checking. If `new_member_cnt` exceeds `MAX_MON_DOMAIN`, an integer overflow could occur, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
