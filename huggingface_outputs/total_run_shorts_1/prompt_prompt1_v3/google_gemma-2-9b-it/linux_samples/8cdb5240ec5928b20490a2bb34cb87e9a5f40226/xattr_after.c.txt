VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the loop that iterates through extended attributes. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking when accessing the `last->e_value_size` member.

If the `last->e_value_size` value is larger than the allocated buffer for `last
