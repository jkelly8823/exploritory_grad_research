VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 14, 18, 22, 26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates the allocation of keyrings using `keyring_alloc()` without proper bounds checking on the input parameters. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if an attacker can control the length of the input strings or other parameters passed to `
