VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
The code snippets you provided exhibit potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the use of `keyring_alloc` without proper bounds checking on the input parameters. 

Specifically, the `keyring_alloc` function allocates memory for a keyring structure. The size of
