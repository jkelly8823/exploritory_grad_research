VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `u16 opcode = get_unaligned_le16(skb->data);` attempts to read 2 bytes (16 bits) from the `skb->data` buffer. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the buffer has at least
