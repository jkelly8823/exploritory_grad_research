VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates as long as the least significant bit of the value read from `iterator->_arg` is set. However, the loop increments `iterator->_arg` by `sizeof(uint32_t)` in each iteration without checking if this increment would lead to
