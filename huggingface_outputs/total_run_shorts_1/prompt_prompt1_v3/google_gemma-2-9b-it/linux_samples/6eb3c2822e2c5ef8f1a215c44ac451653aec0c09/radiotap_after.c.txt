VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates over the payload, incrementing `iterator->_arg` with `sizeof(uint32_t)` in each iteration. However, there is no check to ensure that `iterator->_arg` does not exceed the bounds of the allocated buffer.
