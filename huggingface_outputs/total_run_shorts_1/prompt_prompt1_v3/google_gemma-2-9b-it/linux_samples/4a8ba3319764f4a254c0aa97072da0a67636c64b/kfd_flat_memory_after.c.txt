VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates over devices using a `while` loop and increments the `id` variable within the loop. If `id` reaches `NUM_OF_SUPPORTED_GPUS` before the loop condition is met, an integer overflow can occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
