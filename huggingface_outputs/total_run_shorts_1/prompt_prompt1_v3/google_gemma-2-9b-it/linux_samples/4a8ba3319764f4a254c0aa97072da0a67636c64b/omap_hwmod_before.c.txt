VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates through an array of `mpu_irqs` and copies data into a `res` structure. The variable `r` is used as an index into `res`.  The loop condition `i < mpu_irqs_cnt` and the increment `r++` could lead to an integer overflow if
