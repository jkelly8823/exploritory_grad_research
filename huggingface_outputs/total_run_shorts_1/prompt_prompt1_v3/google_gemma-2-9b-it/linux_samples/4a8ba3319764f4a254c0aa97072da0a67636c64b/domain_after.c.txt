VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Null Pointer Dereference
EXPLANATION:
The function `of_genpd_get_from_provider` always returns `genpd`, which is initialized with `ERR_PTR(-ENOENT)`. This means that `genpd` will always point to an error pointer, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if used incorrectly in subsequent code
