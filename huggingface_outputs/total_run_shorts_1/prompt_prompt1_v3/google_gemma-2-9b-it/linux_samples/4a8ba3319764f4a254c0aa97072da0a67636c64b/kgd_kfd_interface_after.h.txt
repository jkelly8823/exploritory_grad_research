VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The function pointer `hqd_load` is declared without any bounds checking on the input parameter `wptr`. This means that if a malicious actor can control the value of `wptr`, they could potentially write beyond the allocated memory for the `wptr` parameter, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
