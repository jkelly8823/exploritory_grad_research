VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Loop
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential infinite loop. The `while` loop iterates until `loop_limit` reaches zero. However, the loop condition `if (*msw == readl(base + KONA_GPTIMER_STCHI_OFFSET))` may never be met, leading to an infinite loop. This can occur
