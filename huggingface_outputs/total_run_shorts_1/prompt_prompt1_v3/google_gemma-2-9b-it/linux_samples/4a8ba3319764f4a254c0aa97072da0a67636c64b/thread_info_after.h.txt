VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines macros for retrieving thread information based on the architecture (PPC64 or otherwise). It uses assembly instructions to access the thread information and then casts the result to a `struct thread_info` pointer. While the code relies on assembly, it appears to be correctly implemented and doesn't exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
