VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `id[ATA_ID_FEATURE_SUPP] &= ~(1 << 8);` performs a bitwise AND operation on `id[ATA_ID_FEATURE_SUPP]` with a mask. If `id` is not a sufficiently sized array, this operation could lead to a buffer overflow.
