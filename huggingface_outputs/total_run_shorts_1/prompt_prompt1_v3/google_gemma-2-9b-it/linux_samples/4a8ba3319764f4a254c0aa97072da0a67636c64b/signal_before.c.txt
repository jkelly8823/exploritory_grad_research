VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code assigns the value `0x1040` to the `regs->ra` register.  If `0x1040` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the `regs->ra` register, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
