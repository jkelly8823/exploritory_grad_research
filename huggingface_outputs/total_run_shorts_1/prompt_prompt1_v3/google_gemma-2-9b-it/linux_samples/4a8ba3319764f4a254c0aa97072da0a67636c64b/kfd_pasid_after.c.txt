VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the size of the `pasid_bitmap` array based on `pasid_limit`. If `pasid_limit` is a very large number, it could potentially overflow the `BITS_TO_LONGS` function, leading to an integer overflow. This could result in a buffer overflow or other memory corruption
