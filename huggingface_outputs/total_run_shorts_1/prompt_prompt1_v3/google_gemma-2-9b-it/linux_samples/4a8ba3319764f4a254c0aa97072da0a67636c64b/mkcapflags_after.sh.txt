VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `sed` command to extract a value from a string. The `sed` command is vulnerable to command injection if the input string is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the string, which would then be executed by `sed`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the input string before using it
