VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `id` is incremented within the `while` loop condition. If `id` reaches its maximum value before the loop terminates, it will overflow and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking to ensure that `id
