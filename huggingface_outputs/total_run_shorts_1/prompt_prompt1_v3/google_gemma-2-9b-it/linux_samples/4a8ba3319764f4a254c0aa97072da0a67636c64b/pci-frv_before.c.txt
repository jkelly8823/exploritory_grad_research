VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `r->start` is not null before proceeding. However, there's a possibility that `r` itself could be a null pointer, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. If `dev->resource[idx]` returns a null pointer, accessing `r->start` will
