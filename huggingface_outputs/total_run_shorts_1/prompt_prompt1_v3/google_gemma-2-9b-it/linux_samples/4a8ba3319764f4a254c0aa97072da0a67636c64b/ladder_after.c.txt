VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates `last_residency` by subtracting `drv->states[last_idx].exit_latency` from `cpuidle_get_last_residency(dev)`.  Without knowing the data types and ranges of these variables, it's impossible to definitively say if an overflow will occur. However
