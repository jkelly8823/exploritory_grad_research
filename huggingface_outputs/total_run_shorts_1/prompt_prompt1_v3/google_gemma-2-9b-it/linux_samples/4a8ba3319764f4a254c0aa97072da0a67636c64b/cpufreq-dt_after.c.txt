VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `kzalloc` function allocates memory for the `priv` pointer. However, if `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory (returning `NULL`), the code proceeds to the `goto out_free_opp` label. This label attempts to
