VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `pasid_limit` is assigned the value of `max_num_of_processes`. If `max_num_of_processes` is a very large number, it could potentially exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type used for `pasid
