VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16-21
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `num` and `den` variables, used to calculate the timer frequency, are assigned values based on the system clock rate.  If the system clock rate is very high, the values of `num` and `den` could exceed the maximum representable value
