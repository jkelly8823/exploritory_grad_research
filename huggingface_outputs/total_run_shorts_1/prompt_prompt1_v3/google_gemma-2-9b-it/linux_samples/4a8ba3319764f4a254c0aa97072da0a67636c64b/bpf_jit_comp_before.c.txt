VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_TYPE: Use After Free
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. In the `bpb_jit_compile` function, the `kfree(addrs)` call frees the memory pointed to by `addrs`. However, the subsequent line `memcpy(image + proglen, temp
