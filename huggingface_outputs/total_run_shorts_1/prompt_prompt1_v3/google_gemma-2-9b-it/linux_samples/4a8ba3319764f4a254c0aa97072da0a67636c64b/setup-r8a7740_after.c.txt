VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be configuring interrupt controllers. It uses `ioremap_nocache` to map memory-mapped registers, which is a common practice for interacting with hardware. There are no obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
