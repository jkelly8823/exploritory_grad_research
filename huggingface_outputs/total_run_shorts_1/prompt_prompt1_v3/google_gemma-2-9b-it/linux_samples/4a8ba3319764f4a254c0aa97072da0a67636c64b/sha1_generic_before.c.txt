VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of SHA1 for security purposes
EXPLANATION: 
The SHA1 hashing algorithm is considered insecure and deprecated. It is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning that different inputs can produce the same hash output. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as message forgery and data integrity breaches.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace SHA1 with a more secure hashing algorithm, such as SHA
