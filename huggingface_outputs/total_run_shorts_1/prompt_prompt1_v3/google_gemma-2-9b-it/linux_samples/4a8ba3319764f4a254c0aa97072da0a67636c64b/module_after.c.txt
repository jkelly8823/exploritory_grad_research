VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `vfree(module_region);` attempts to free memory pointed to by `module_region`. However, there is no check on the size of `module_region`. If `module_region` points to a buffer that is larger than the allocated memory, a buffer
