VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `r->start` is not null before proceeding. However, there's a possibility that `r` itself could be a dangling pointer, meaning it points to memory that has already been freed. If `r` is a dangling pointer, accessing `r->start` can lead to a
