VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `copy_to_user` function copies data from the kernel space to user space. If the `ret_size` value is larger than the size of the user-provided buffer (`buf`), it can lead to a buffer overflow. This occurs because the `copy_
