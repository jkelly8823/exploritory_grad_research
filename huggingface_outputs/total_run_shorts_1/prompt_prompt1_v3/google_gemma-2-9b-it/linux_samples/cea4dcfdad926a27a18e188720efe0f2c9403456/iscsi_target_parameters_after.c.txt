VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `strlcpy` function is used to copy the `key` and `NOTUNDERSTOOD` strings into the `extra_response->key` and `extra_response->value` buffers respectively. However, the sizes of these buffers are not checked against the lengths of the input strings. This can lead to a buffer overflow
