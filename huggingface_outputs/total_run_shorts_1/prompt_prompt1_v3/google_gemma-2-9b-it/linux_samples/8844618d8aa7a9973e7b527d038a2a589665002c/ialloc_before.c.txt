VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in `memset` function.
EXPLANATION:
The `memset` function is used to initialize a buffer with zeros. However, the size of the buffer is calculated as `(EXT4_INODES_PER_GROUP(sb) + 7) / 8`. This calculation does not account for potential integer overflows. If `EXT4_INODES_PER_GROUP(sb
