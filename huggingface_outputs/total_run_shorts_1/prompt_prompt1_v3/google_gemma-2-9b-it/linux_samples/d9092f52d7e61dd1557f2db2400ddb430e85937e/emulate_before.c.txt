VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `decode_operand` function is called without any bounds checking on the input `ctxt->dst`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `ctxt->dst` is larger than the allocated buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that `ctxt->dst` is within the bounds of the allocated buffer before calling `decode_operand`.
