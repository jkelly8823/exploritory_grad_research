VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `ldr >>= 32 - map->ldr_bits;` performs a right shift operation on the `ldr` variable. If `map->ldr_bits` is greater than or equal to 32, the right shift will result in an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
