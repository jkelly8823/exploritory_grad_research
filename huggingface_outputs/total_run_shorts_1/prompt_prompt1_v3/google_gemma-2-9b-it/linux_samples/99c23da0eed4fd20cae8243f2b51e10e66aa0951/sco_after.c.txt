VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `sco_send_frame` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of `memcpy` without proper bounds checking. 

The `memcpy` function copies data from `buf` to `skb_put(skb, len)`. If the length of `buf
