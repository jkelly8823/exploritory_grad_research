VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares a pointer `data` without specifying its size. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the pointer is used to access memory beyond its allocated bounds.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Determine the required size for the `data` pointer and allocate memory accordingly.
- Use bounds checking when accessing memory through the `data`
