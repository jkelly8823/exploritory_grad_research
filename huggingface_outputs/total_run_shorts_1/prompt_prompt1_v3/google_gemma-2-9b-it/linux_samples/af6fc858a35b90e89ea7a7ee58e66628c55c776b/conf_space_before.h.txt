VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares a pointer `data` without allocating any memory for it. This creates a vulnerability where a buffer overflow could occur if the code attempts to write data to `data` without ensuring it has sufficient space.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Allocate memory for `data` using `malloc()` or a similar function before using it.
