VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `!strcmp(parent->name, core->parent_names[i])` comparison could lead to a buffer overflow if `parent->name` is longer than the allocated size of `core->parent_names[i]`.  This is because `strcmp` doesn't perform bounds checking on the input strings.
