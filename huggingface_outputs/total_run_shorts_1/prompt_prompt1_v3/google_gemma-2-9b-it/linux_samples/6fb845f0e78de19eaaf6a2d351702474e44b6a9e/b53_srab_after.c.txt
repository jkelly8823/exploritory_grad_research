VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates through a loop with a counter variable `i` ranging from 0 to `B53_N_PORTS - 1`.  If `B53_N_PORTS` is not carefully defined, there is a risk of an integer overflow. If `i` reaches a value greater than the maximum
