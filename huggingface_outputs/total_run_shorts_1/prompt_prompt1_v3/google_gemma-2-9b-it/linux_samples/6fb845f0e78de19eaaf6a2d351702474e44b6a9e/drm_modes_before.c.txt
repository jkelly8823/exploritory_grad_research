VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `calc_val = (mode->clock * 1000) / mode->htotal;` is susceptible to integer overflow. If `mode->clock` is large enough and `mode->htotal` is small enough, the multiplication `mode->clock * 1000` can exceed the maximum
