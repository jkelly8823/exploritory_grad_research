VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. After `response_list_del(sr, cmdq)` is executed, the `sr` pointer is no longer valid as it has been removed from the response list. However, subsequent lines access members of `sr` (e.g.,
