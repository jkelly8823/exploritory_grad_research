VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `cpuid` is incremented within a loop that iterates through available processors. If the number of processors exceeds the maximum value representable by the `cpuid` variable, an overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as accessing memory
