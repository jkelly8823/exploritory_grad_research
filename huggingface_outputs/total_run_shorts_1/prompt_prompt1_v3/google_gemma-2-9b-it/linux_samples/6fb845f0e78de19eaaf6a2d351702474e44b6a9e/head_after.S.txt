VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The line `neg a2, a0` performs a two's complement negation on the value stored in register `a0` and stores the result in register `a2`. If the value in `a0` is the minimum representable value for the data type, the negation will result in an overflow, leading to an unexpected
