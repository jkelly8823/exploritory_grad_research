VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code defines `TASK_SIZE` but does not provide its value. If `TASK_SIZE` is large enough, the expression `TASK_SIZE >> 1` could result in an integer overflow. This overflow could lead to `TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE` being calculated incorrectly, potentially causing memory corruption or other security issues
