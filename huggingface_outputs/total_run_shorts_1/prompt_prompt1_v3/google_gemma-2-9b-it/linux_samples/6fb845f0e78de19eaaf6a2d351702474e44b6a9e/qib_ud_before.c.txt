VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when copying data from `ohdr->u.ud.imm_data` into `wc.ex.imm_data`. If `ohdr->u.ud.imm_data` is larger than the allocated size of `wc.ex.imm_data`, a buffer overflow could occur.
