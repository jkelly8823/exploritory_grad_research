VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `boot_cpu_data.microcode` is greater than or equal to `p->patch_id`.  If `boot_cpu_data.microcode` is larger than the maximum representable value for the data type used for `patch_id`, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead
