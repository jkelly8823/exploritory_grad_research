VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16,17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `priv->open_count` is incremented without any bounds checking. If `priv->open_count` reaches its maximum value (likely an unsigned integer), incrementing it will cause an overflow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or a denial-of-
