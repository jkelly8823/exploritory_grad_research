VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `keymax = (key->max_value & 0xffffff) | PLANE_KEYMAX_ALPHA(alpha);`  could potentially lead to an integer overflow.  The expression `key->max_value & 0xffffff` performs a bitwise AND operation, effectively masking the upper bits of `key->max
