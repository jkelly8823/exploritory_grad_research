VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memset_io` function is missing a check for buffer overflow. It takes a pointer to an I/O memory location (`a`), a value to fill (`b`), and a size (`c`). If `c` is larger than the available space at the memory location pointed to by `a`, a buffer overflow will occur
