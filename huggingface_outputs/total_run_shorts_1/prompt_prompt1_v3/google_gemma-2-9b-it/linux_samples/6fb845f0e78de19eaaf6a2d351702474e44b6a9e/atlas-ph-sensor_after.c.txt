VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `val` is within the range of 0 to 20000. However, there is a potential for integer overflow if `val` exceeds this limit. The calculation `val / 10` could result in an overflow if `val` is large enough.
