VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the `flags` variable contains the bits corresponding to `VM_WRITE` and `VM_EXEC`. However, there is a potential for integer overflow if the value of `flags` is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an `unsigned long`. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect
