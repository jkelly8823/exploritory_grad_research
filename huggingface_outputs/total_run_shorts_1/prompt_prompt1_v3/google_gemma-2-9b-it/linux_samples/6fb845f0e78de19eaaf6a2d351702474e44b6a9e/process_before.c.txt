VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `for` loop iterates through a maximum of `max_insns` (128) instructions. However, the `ip` pointer is not properly checked before accessing `ip->halfword[0]`. If the `ip` pointer points beyond the
