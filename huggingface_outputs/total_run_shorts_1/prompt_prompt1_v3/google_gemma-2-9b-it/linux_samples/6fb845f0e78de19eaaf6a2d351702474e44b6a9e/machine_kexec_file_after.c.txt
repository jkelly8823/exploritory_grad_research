VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `vmalloc()` function allocates memory dynamically. However, the code lacks proper bounds checking to ensure that the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the data being written to it.

The `cmdline_len` variable determines the length of the command line, and `buf_size
