VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Underflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `tx_level -= db->rptr->len;` performs a subtraction operation. If `db->rptr->len` is greater than `tx_level`, this will result in an integer underflow. Integer underflow occurs when the result of a subtraction operation is less than the minimum value that can be represented
