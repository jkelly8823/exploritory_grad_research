VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < gc->ngpio`. If `gc->ngpio` is a very large number, the loop could execute a large number of times, potentially leading to an integer overflow when calculating the address `
