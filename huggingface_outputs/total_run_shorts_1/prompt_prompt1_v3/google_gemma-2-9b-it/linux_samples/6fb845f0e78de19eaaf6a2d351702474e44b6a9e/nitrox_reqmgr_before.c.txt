VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability.  The `response_list_del(sr, cmdq)` function call removes the `sr` structure from a response list. However, subsequent lines access members of `sr` (e.g., `sr->resp.orh`, `
