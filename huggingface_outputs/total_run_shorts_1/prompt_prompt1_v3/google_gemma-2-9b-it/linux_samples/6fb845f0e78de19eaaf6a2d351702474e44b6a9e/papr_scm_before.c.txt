VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `plpar_hcall` function is called repeatedly with a `token` value. If the `token` value is not properly validated and sanitized, it could potentially overflow the `ret` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
