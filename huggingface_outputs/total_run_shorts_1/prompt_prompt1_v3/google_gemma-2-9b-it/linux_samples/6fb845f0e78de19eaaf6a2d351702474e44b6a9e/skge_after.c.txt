VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memset` function initializes a buffer `p` with zeros, but the subsequent `memcpy_fromio` call copies data from an external source (`io`) into the same buffer `p`.  The size of the data copied is determined by `regs->len`, which
