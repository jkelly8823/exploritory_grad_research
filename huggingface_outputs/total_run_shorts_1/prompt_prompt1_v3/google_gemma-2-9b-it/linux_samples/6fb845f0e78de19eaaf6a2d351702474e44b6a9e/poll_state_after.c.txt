VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The loop counter `i` iterates from 1 to `drv->state_count - 1`. If `drv->state_count` is a large value, the loop might execute a large number of times, potentially exceeding the maximum value representable by an `int`. This
