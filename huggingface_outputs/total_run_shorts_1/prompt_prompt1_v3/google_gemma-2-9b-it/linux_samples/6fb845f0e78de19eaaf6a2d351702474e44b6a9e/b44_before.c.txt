VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Free
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential double free vulnerability.  In the first block, `dev_kfree_skb_irq(skb);` frees the `skb` buffer. Later, in the second block, `dev_kfree_skb_any(skb);` attempts to free the same `skb` buffer again,
