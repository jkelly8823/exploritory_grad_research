VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing default case in switch statement
EXPLANATION:
A switch statement should have a default case to handle any input that doesn't match the existing cases. In this code, if the value of 'clock' is not one of the cases listed, the code will fall through to the next case, which is not intended behavior. This can lead to unexpected results or errors
