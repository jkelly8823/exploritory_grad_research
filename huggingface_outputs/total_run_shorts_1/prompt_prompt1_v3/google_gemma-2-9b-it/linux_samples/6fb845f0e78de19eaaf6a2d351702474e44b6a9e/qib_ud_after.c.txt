VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when assigning data to `wc.ex.imm_data`. If `ohdr->u.ud.imm_data` is larger than the allocated size of `wc.ex.imm_data`, a buffer overflow could occur. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
