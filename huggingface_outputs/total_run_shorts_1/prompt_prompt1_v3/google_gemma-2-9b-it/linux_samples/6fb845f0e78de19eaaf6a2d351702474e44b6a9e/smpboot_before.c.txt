VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `cpuid` variable. The `cpuid` variable is incremented within the loop, and if it reaches the maximum value representable by its data type, an overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as accessing memory outside the allocated bounds
