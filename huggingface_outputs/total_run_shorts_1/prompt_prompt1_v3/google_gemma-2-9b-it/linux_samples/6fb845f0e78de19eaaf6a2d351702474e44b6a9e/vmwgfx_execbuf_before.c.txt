VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a pointer `p_fence` being set to `NULL`.  Later in the code, there's a potential for this pointer to be used after it has been freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. This can result in crashes or arbitrary code execution.
