VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `temp64 *= rate - divfi;` has the potential for integer overflow.  The multiplication of `temp64` (which is a 64-bit unsigned integer) by `rate - divfi` could result in a value exceeding the maximum representable value for a 64-bit unsigned
