VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `adev->external_rev_id` variable is being updated based on the value of `adev->rev_id`. If `adev->rev_id` is large enough, adding 0x81 or 0x41 to it could result in
