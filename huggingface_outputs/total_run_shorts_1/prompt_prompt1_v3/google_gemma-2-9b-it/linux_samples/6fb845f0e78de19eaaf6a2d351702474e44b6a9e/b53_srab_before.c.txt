VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates through a loop with the variable `i` ranging from 0 to B53_N_PORTS - 1.  If B53_N_PORTS is not carefully defined, there is a risk of an integer overflow. If B53_N_PORTS is larger than the maximum value an
