VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memset` function initializes a buffer `p` with zeros, but the subsequent `memcpy_fromio` calls may write beyond the allocated size of `p`. 

The first `memcpy_fromio` writes data from `io` to `p` up to
