VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 21-24
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `dev_err` function calls are vulnerable because they concatenate strings without bounds checking. If the input strings are longer than the allocated buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use safer string handling functions that perform bounds checking, such as
