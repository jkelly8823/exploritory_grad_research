VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The variable `dd` is used to access `dd->status`, but there is no guarantee that `dd` is still valid after the `break` statement. If `dd` is freed or its pointer becomes invalid before the `if` statement is
