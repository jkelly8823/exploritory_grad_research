VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the `if` statement chain. The `strncmp` function compares strings, but without bounds checking on the input strings (`str`), it's possible for an attacker to provide a
