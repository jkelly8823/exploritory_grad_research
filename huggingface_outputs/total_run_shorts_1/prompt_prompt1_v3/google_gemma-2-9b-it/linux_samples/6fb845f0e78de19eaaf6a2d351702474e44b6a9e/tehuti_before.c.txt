VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to free the skb pointer using `dev_kfree_skb_irq(db->rptr->addr.skb)`. However, the subsequent line `bdx_tx_db_inc_rptr(db)` might access the memory location pointed to by `db->rptr` after it
