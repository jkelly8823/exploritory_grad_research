VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The line `gfn += page_size >> PAGE_SHIFT;` increments the `gfn` variable by a value calculated as `page_size >> PAGE_SHIFT`. If `page_size` is large enough, this calculation could result in an integer
