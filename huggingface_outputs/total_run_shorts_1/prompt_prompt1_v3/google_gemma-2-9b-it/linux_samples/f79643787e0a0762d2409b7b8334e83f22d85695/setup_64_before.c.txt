VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `rfi_flush = enable;` assigns the value of the `enable` variable to the `rfi_flush` variable. If the `enable` variable holds a large integer value, it could potentially overflow the `r
