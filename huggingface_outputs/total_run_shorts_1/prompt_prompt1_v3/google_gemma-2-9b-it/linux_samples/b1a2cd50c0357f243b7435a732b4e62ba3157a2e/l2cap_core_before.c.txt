VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `l2cap_add_conf_opt` function call is potentially vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The function takes several arguments, including a pointer to a buffer (`ptr`), the size of the buffer (`sizeof(rfc)`), and a pointer to the data to be copied (`(unsigned long) &rfc`).
