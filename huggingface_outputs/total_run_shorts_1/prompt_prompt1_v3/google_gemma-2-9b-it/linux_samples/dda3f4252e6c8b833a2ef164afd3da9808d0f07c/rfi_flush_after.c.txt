VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 29, 30
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability.  Lines 29 and 30 involve the calculation `repetitions * l1d_misses_expected / 2`. If `repetitions` and `l1d_misses_expected` are large enough, the product could exceed
