VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `vcpu->arch.time_offset = data & ~(PAGE_MASK | 1);` performs a bitwise AND operation between `data` and `~(PAGE_MASK | 1)`. If `data` is larger than the maximum representable value for `vcpu->arch.time_offset`, an integer overflow
