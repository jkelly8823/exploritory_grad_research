VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if an `id` value is within a certain range and performs different actions based on the result. The vulnerability lies in the potential for a buffer overflow when `id` is used in the `read_idmap` array access. If `id` is larger than the allocated size of `
