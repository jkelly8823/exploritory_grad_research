VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `rcu_dereference(ima_rules)` call attempts to access the `ima_rules` pointer after it might have been freed.  

Without knowing the context of `rcu_read_lock()` and `rcu_dere
