VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 6, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the `__sys_recvmmsg` function, which is responsible for receiving multiple message segments. The vulnerability lies in the potential for a buffer overflow when handling the `struct mmsghdr` array passed to this function.

The `vlen` variable determines the number of
