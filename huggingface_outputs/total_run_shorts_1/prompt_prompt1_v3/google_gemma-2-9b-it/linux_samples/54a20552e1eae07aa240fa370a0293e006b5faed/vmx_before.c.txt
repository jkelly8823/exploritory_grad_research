VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `eb` is a 32-bit unsigned integer (`u32`).  The code sets `eb` to a value that could potentially exceed the maximum value representable by a 32-bit unsigned integer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Use a larger
