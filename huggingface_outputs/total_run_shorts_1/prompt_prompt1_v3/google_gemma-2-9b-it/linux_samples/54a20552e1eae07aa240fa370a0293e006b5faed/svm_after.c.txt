VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet repeatedly calls `set_exception_intercept` and `set_intercept` functions without bounds checking. This could lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities if the `svm` structure or related data structures have limited size.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking within the `set_exception_
