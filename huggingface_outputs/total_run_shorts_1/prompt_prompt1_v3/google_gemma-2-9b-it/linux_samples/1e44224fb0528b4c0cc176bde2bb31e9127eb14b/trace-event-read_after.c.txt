VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. Inside the loop, `sys` is allocated memory using `read_event_file(pevent, sys, size)`. However, the `free(sys)` call is only executed if `ret` is non-zero, indicating an error. If `ret` is zero (
