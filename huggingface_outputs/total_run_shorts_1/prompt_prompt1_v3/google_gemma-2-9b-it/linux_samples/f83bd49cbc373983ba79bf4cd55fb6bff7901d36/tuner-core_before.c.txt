VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the use of `fe_tuner_ops->get_status` function without proper bounds checking on the `tuner_status` variable. If the `get_status
