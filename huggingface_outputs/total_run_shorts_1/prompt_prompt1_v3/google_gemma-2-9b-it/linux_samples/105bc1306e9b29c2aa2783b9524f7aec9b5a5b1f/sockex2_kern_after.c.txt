VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing bounds check in `flow_dissector` function.
EXPLANATION:
The `flow_dissector` function loads a halfword value from the skb at offset 12. There is no check to ensure that the skb has at least 2 bytes remaining at this offset. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the skb is too short.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a bounds check before accessing the skb
