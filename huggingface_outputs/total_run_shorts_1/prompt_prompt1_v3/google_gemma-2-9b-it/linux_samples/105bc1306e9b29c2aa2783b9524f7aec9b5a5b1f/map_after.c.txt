VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `malloc(info.key_size)` call allocates memory for the `key` variable based on the value of `info.key_size`. However, there is no check to ensure that
