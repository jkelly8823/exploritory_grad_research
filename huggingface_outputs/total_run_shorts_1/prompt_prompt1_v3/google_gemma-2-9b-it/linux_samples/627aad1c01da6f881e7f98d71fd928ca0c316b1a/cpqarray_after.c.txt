VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a `copy_to_user` function call which is used to copy data from kernel space to user space. The issue is that the size of the data being copied (`sizeof(pciinfo)`) is not explicitly checked against the size of the buffer pointed to by `arg`. If the user-provided buffer is smaller than the size of `pci
