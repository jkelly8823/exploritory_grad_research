VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `copy_to_user` function is used to copy data from kernel space to user space. However, the size of the data being copied (`&pciinfo`) is not checked against the size of the buffer pointed to by `arg`. If the user-provided buffer is smaller
