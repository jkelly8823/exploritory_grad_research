VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the line `gfn += 1;`, the variable `gfn` is incremented by 1. If `gfn` is already near its maximum value, this increment could cause it to overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.
