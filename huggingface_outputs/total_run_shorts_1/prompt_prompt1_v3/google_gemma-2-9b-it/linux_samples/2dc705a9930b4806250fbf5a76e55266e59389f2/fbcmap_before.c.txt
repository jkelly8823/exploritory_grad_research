VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `copy_to_user` function is used to copy data from kernel space to user space. If the size of the data to be copied is larger than the available space in the user buffer, a buffer overflow can occur. This can lead to a crash or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
