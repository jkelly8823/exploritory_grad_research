VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `cfg->scan_request` to NULL, but then later accesses `cfg->scan_request` in the `if (fw_abort)` block. If `cfg` is freed before the `if` block is executed, this could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability
