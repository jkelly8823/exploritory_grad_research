VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 6, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential infinite loop. If `xen_allocate_irq_dynamic()` repeatedly returns -1, the code will continuously attempt to allocate a new IRQ, never reaching the `out` label. This can lead to resource exhaustion and system instability.
