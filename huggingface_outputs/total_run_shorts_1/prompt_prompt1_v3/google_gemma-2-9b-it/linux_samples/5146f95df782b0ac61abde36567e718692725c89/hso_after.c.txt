VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the loop condition: `for (i = 0; i <= if_num; ++i)`. 

If `if_num` is a large value, the loop will iterate beyond the bounds of the `driver_info` array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow
