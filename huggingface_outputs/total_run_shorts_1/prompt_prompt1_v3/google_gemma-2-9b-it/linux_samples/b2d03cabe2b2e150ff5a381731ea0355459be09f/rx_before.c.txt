VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `mmie_keyidx` is within a specific range. However, there is a potential for integer overflow if `mmie_keyidx` is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by the integer data type used. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access when accessing `rx->
