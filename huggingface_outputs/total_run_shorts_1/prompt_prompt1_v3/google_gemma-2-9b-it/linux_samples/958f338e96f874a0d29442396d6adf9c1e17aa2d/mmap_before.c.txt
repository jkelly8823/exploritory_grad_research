VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds read
EXPLANATION:
The code `phys_addr_valid(addr + count - 1)` potentially performs an out-of-bounds read. If `count` is equal to or greater than the size of the memory region pointed to by `addr`, then accessing `addr + count - 1` will go beyond the valid memory
