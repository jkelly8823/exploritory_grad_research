VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `elems->dtim_count = elems->bssid_index->dtim_count;`  is susceptible to a buffer overflow. 

Without knowing the exact size of `elems->bssid_index` and `elems->dtim
