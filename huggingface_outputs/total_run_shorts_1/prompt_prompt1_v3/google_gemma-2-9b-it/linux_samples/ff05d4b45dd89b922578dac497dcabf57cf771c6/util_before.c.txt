VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The line `nontransmitted_profile = kmalloc(params->len, GFP_ATOMIC);` allocates memory for `nontransmitted_profile` based on the value of `params->len`. If `params->len` is larger than the available memory, this could lead to a buffer overflow.
