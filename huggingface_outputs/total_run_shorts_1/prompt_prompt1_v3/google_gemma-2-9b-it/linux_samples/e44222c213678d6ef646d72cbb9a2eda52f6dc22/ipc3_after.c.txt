VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function is used without bounds checking. This means that if `msg->reply_size` is larger than the allocated size of `reply_data`, a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to data corruption, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a bounds-checked memory copy function,
