VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet conditionally uses either `__memcpy3d` or `__memcpy` for copying memory.  Without knowing the implementation details of these functions, there's a possibility that `__memcpy3d` could be vulnerable to a buffer overflow if the input `n` (size) is not properly validated
