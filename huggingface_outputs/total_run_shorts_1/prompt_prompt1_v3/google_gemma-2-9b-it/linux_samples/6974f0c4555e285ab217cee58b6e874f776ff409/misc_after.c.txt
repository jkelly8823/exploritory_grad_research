VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The `debug_putstr` function is likely not checking the length of the string it is attempting to print. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer allocated for it. A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory
