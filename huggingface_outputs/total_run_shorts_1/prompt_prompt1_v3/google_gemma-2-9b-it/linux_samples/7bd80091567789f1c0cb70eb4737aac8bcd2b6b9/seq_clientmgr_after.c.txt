VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 11, 16, 21, 26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite recursion and resource exhaustion.
EXPLANATION:
The code contains multiple instances of recursive calls to `snd_seq_client_enqueue_event`. This can lead to an infinite recursion loop if not handled properly. Additionally, the function allocates resources within the loop, which can
