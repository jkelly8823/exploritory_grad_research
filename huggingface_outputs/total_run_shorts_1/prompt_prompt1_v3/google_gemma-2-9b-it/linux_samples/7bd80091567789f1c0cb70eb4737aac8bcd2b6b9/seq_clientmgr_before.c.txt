VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 11, 16, 21, 26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential for infinite recursion and logic errors.
EXPLANATION:
The code contains multiple instances of recursive calls to `snd_seq_client_enqueue_event` without clear exit conditions. This can lead to infinite recursion, causing a stack overflow and program crash. Additionally, the logic for
