VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided does not include the full context of the `for_each_online_cpu` loop. However, based on the provided lines, there is a potential for an integer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates over all online CPUs, and if the number of online CPUs exceeds the maximum value that the `cpu` variable
