VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The line `movl __per_cpu_offset(,%eax,4), %eax` involves an arithmetic operation with `%eax` potentially leading to an integer overflow. If the value of `%eax` is large enough, adding 4 to it
