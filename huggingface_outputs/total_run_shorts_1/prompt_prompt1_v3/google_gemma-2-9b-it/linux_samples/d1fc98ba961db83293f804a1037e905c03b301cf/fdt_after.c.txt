VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when accessing the `fdt` structure. The `fdt_next_node` function is assumed to return a valid node pointer, but there's no guarantee that it won't return a value exceeding the allocated memory of `fdt`. This could lead to an integer overflow, potentially causing a
