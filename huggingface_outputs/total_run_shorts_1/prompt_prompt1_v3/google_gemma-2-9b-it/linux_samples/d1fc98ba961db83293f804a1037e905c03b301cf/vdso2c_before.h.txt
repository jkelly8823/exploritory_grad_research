VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 100-102
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
Lines 100-102 calculate the size of the fake sections and the number of sections. If the `fake_sections_size` is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint64_t`, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead
