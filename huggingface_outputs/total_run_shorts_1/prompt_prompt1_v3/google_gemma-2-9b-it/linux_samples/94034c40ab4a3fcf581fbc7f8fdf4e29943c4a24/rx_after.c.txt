VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function in lines 6 and 10 copies data without checking the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source data is larger than the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `strncpy` or `snprintf` instead of `memcpy`
