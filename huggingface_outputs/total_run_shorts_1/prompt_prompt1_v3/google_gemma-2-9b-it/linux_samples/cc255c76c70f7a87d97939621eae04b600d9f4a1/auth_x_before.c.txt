VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `sigblock->len = cpu_to_le32(4*sizeof(u32));` calculates the length of the signature block. However, the subsequent encryption operation `ceph_x_encrypt(&au->session_key, enc_
