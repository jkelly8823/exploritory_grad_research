VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19, 20, 21, 22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Lines 19-22 involve reading data from memory using `ops->read_std` without proper bounds checking. The `io_bitmap_ptr` and `port/8` values are used to
