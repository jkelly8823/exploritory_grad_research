VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use after free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The variable `bss_desc` is allocated using `kzalloc` but its lifetime is not explicitly managed. If the `bss` pointer becomes invalid (e.g., due to a previous deallocation or modification), accessing `bss_desc
