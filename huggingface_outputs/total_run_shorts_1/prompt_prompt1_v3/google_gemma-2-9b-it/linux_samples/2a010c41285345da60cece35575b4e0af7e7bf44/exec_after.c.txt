VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to access `exec` after it has been freed. This can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that `exec` is not accessed after it has been freed.
- Consider using a reference counting mechanism to track the lifetime of `exec`.
