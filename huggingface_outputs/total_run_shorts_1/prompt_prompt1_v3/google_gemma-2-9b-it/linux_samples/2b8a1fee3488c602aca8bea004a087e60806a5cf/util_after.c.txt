VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the `subframe_len` is greater than the remaining data (`remaining`). However, it does not adequately validate the `subframe_len` against the maximum buffer size. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `subframe_len` is larger than the available buffer space.
