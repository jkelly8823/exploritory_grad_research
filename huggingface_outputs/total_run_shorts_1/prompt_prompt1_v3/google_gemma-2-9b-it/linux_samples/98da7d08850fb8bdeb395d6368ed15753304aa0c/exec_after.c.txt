VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `ptr_size` plus `size` exceeds `ULONG_MAX`. This check is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. If `ptr_size` is large enough, it could cause `size + ptr_size` to overflow `ULONG_MAX`, leading to an incorrect result. This could potentially allow
