VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: NULL Pointer Dereference
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `cbuff` is NULL. If it is, the code jumps to the `err_exit` label. However, there is no check to ensure that `cbuff` is not NULL before accessing its contents. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `cbuff` is indeed NULL
