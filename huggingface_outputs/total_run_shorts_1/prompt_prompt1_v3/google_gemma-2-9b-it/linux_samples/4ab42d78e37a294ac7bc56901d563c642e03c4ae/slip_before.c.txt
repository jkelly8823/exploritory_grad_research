VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to `slhc_init(16, 16)`.  Without knowing the implementation of `slhc_init`, it is impossible to definitively say if a buffer overflow exists. However, if `slhc_init` allocates memory based on the provided arguments (16,
