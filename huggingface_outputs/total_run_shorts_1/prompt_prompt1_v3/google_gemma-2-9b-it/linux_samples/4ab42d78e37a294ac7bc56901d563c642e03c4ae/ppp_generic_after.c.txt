VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `val &= 0xffff;` performs a bitwise AND operation between `val` and `0xffff`. If `val` is larger than `0xffff`, this operation could result in an integer overflow. An overflow occurs when a calculation produces a result that is too large to be represented by the data type. In this
