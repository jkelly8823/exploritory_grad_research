VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. If `is->slcomp` is not properly freed when it is no longer needed, it can lead to a memory leak. This occurs because the code allocates memory for `is->slcomp` using `slhc_init()` and then potentially realloc
