VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for corrupted xattr entries. The vulnerability lies in the line `if ((void *)next >= s->end)`.  If `next` points to a memory location beyond the allocated buffer `s->end`, it can lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input to manipulate the `next
