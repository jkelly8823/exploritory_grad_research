VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 10, 15, 20, 25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the `segmented_read_std` and `segmented_write_std` functions. These functions handle memory access operations, and the lack of bounds checking on the `size` parameter could lead to a buffer overflow
