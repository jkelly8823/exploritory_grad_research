VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `stw r0,0(r3)` instruction performs a store operation. Without knowing the size of `r0` and the context of `r3`, it's impossible to determine if this operation will write beyond the allocated memory for `r3`. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if `r0` contains
