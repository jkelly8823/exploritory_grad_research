VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `reboot_code_buffer + KEXEC_CONTROL_PAGE_SIZE);` appears to be attempting to access memory beyond the bounds of the `reboot_code_buffer` variable. Without knowing the size of `reboot_code_buffer`, it's impossible to definitively
