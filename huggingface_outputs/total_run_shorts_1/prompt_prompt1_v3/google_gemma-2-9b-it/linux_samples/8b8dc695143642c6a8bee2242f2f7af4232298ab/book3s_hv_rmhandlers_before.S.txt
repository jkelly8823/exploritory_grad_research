VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential for Integer Overflow in MSR Manipulation
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates manipulation of the MSR (Machine Status Register) using the `ori` instruction.  The `ori` instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between two registers.  If the value in `r11` (which is intended to be the MSR) is already set with
