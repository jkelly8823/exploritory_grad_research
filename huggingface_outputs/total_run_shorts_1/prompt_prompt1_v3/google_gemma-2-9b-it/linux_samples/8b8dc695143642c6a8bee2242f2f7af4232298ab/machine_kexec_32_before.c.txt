VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `reboot_code_buffer + KEXEC_CONTROL_PAGE_SIZE);` appears to be attempting to write data to a memory location without properly validating the size of the buffer (`reboot_code_buffer`). This could lead to data overwriting adjacent memory locations, potentially
