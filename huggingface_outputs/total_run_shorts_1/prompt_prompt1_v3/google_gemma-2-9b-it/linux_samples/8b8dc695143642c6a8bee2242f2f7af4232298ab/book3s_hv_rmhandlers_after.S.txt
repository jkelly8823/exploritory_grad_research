VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The lines `LOAD_REG_ADDR(r11, dawr_force_enable)` and `lbz	r11, 0(r11)` load a value from memory into register `r11`.  If `dawr_force_
