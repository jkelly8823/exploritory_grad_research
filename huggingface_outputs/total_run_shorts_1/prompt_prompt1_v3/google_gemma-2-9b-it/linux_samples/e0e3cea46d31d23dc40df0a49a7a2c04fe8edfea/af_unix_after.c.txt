VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a double free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential double free vulnerability.  The `siocb->scm` pointer is set to `&tmp_scm` if it's NULL.  This could lead to a double free if `siocb->scm` was previously allocated and then freed elsewhere
