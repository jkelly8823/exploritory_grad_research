VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for a `file` structure using `kmalloc`. However, the code does not check if the allocation was successful before using the `file` pointer. If `kmalloc` fails to allocate memory, `file` will be `NULL`, and accessing it will lead to a use-after
