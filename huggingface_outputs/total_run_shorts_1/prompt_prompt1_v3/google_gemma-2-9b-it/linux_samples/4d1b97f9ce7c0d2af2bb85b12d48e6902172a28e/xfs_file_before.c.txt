VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the inode is an always COW inode. If it is not, it calls xfs_alloc_file_space to allocate file space. However, there is no check on the validity of the `offset` and `len` parameters passed to xfs_alloc_file_space
