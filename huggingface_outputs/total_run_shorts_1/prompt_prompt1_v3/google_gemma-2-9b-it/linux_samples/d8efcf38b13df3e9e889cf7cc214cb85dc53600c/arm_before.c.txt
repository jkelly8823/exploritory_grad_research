VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `cmd` is declared as an `unsigned long`, which typically has a limited range. If a value larger than the maximum representable value for `unsigned long` is assigned to `cmd`, an overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even security
