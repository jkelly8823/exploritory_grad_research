VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet performs a bitwise AND operation (`&=`) on `base_addr` and `PT64_LVL_ADDR_MASK(iterator.level)`. If `base_addr` is larger than the maximum value representable by the data type used for `base_addr`, an integer overflow could occur. This
