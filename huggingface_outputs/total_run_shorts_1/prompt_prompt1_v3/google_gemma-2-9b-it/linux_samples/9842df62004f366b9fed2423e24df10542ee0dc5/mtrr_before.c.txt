VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `case` statement uses integer values to determine which code block to execute. If a value larger than the maximum representable integer for the data type used in the `case` statement is encountered, it could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow can result in unexpected
