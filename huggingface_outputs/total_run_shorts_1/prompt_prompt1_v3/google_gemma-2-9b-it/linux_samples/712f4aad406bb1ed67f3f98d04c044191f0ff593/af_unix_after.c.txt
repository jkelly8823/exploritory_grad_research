VULNERABLE_LINES: 19,20,21,22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `unix_attach_fds` function. The vulnerability arises from the loop that iterates through the `scm->fp->count` number of file descriptors. The loop iterates without bounds checking, potentially leading to a buffer overflow
