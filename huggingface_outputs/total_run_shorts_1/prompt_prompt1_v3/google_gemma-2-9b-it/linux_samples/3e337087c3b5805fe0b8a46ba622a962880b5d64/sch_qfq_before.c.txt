VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory for `new_agg`, the code proceeds without checking the return value. This could lead to a scenario where `new_agg` is a null pointer, and subsequent operations on it (e.g.,
