VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `rtl_cam_del_entry(hw, p_macaddr)` and `rtl_cam_delete_one_entry(hw, p_macaddr, entry_id)` functions are called without any bounds checking on the input `p_
