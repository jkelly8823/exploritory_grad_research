VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `d` is assigned the result of `vhost_get_vq_desc()`, which is not explicitly checked for potential overflow. If `vhost_get_vq_desc()` returns a value larger than the maximum representable integer for the data
