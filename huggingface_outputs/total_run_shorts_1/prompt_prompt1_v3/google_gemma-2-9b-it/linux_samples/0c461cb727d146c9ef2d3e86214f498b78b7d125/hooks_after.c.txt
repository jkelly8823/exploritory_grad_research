VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when assigning a value to the `error` variable. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of `error` is larger than the allocated memory for the variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the size of the `error` variable is sufficient to hold the potential value being assigned.
