VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `max = ((-1UL) & STACK_RND_MASK) << PAGE_SHIFT;` is vulnerable to an integer overflow. 
The expression `(-1UL) & STACK_RND_MASK`  could potentially result in a value larger than the maximum representable value for `unsigned long`.  When this
