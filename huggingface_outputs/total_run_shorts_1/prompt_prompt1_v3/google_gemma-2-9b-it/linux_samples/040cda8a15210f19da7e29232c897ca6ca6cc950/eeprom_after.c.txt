VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function copies data from one location to another without checking the size of the destination buffer. If the length of the data being copied (`ETH_ALEN`) is greater than the size of the destination buffer (`dev->mt76.macaddr`), a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to data corruption or
