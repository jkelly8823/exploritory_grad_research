VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates through a memory region pointed to by `enc_buf` and `ret`. However, the loop condition `u + 1 <= (u64 *)(enc_buf + ret)` does not adequately check for buffer boundaries. If `ret` is larger than the
