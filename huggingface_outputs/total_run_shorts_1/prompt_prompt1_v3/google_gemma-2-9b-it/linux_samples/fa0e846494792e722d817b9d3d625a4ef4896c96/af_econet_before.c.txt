VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `eb->sec = *saddr;` could lead to a buffer overflow.  The size of `eb->sec` is not checked before assigning the value of `*saddr`. If `*saddr` is larger than the allocated space for `eb->sec`, it could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially causing a crash or security vulnerability.
