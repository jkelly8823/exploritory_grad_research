VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a switch statement (`case`) handling different keyring types. The line `ret = install_process_keyring_to_cred(new);` is potentially vulnerable to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability arises if the `install_process_keyring_to_cred` function does not properly validate the
