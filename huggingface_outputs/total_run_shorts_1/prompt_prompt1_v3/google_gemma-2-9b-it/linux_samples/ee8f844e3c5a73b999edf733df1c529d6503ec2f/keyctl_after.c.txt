VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `ret = PTR_ERR(name);` attempts to dereference a pointer `name` which may not be properly initialized or allocated. If `name` points to an invalid memory location or a buffer that is too small, writing data to it could
