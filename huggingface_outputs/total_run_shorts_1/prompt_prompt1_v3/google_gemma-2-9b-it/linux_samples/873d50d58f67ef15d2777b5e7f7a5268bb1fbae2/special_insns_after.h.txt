VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `bits_missing = ~val & cr4_pinned_bits;` performs a bitwise AND operation between the bitwise NOT of `val` and `cr4_pinned_bits`. If `val` is large enough, the result of
