VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4, 10, 13, 19, 22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly calls `unsafe_put_user` without ensuring sufficient buffer space. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the data being written exceeds the allocated size of the `infop` structure.
