VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3-5, 8, 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow and use-after-free vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly calls `unsafe_put_user` without checking if `infop` is valid. If `infop` is null, accessing its members will lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
