VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The lines 7 and 8 calculate offsets from a base address (`_stext`) and use these offsets to access memory locations. If the calculated offsets are larger than the allocated buffer size, it could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing
