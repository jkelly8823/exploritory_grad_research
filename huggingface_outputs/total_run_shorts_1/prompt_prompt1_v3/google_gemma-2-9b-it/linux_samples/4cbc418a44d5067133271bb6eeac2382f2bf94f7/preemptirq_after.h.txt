VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The lines 7 and 8 directly assign the values of `ip` and `parent_ip` to `__entry->caller_offs` and `__entry->parent_offs` respectively.  Without bounds checking, if `ip` or `parent_ip`
