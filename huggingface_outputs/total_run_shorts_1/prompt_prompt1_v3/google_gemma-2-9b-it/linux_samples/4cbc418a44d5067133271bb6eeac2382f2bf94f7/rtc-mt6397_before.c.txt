VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential for a race condition.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential race condition due to the use of a mutex lock. While the mutex `rtc->lock` is acquired before modifying the RTC registers, there's a possibility that another thread could access and modify the same registers concurrently, leading to inconsistent state.
