VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `kiocb_free(iocb);` line frees the `iocb` memory. However, subsequent lines attempt to access `iocb` (e.g., `if (head == tail)`), which could lead to
