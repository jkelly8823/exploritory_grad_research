VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line 1, Line 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for a condition where `intercept` is compared to `svm->x2avic_msrs_intercepted`.  The potential for an integer overflow exists if `intercept` or `svm->x2avic_msrs_intercepted` are larger than the maximum representable value
