VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `for` loop iterates through an array `direct_access_msrs` without bounds checking. If the size of the array is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially provide a malicious input that exceeds the allocated memory for the array, leading to a buffer overflow.
