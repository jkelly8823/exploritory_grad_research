VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the line `grefs[i] = err;`.  If `err` is larger than the allocated size of the `grefs` array, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This could allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or
