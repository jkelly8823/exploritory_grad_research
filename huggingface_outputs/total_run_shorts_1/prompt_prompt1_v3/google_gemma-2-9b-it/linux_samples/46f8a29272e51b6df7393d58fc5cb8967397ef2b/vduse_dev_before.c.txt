VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from `dev->config + offset` to `buf` with a length of `len`. If `offset` or `len` are manipulated to exceed the bounds of `dev->config`, a buffer overflow can occur.
