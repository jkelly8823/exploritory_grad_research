VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from `dev->config + offset` to `buf`. If `len` is greater than the remaining space in `buf`, a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
