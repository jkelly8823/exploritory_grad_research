VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `qca` using `kzalloc`. However, if `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory, the variable `qca` will be `NULL`.  The code then proceeds to access `qca` in the next line (`if (!qca)`), which could lead to
