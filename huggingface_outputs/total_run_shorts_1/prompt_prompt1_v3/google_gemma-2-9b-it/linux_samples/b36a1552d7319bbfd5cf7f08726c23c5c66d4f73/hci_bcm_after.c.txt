VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The `kzalloc` function allocates memory for a `bcm` structure. However, if `sizeof(*bcm)` is larger than the available memory, `kzalloc` might return a null pointer. In this case, the code will return
