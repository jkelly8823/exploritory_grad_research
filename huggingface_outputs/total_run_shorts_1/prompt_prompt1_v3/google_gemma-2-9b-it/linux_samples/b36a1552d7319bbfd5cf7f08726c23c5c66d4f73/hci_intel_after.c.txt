VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The BT_DBG macro is not shown, but it is likely a debug logging macro that takes a format string and arguments. If the format string is not properly sanitized, an attacker could provide a crafted input for the `hu` argument that overflows the buffer allocated for the debug message. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
