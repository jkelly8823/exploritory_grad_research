VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `kzalloc` to allocate memory for a `mrvl` structure. If `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory, the code returns `-ENOMEM`. However, there is no check to ensure that the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the entire `mrvl` structure. This could lead
