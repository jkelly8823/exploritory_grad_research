VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `buf->addr = addr;` assigns the value of `addr` to the `addr` member of the `buf` structure. However, there is no check on the size of `addr` before the assignment. If `addr` is larger than the allocated memory for `buf->addr`, it can lead to a
