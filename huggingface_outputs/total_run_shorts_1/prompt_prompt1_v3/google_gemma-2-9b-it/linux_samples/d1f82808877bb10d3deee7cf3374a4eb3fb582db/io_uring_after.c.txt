VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `buf->len = min_t(__u32, pbuf->len, MAX_RW_COUNT);` assigns the minimum value between `pbuf->len` and `MAX_RW_COUNT` to `buf->len`. If `pbuf->len` exceeds `MAX_RW_COUNT`, the
