VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability in lines 10 and 11. The expression `vcpu->arch.st.msr_val >> PAGE_SHIFT` shifts the value of `vcpu->arch.st.msr_val` right by `PAGE_SHIFT` bits. If `vcpu
