VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from one location to another without checking the size of the destination buffer. If the `addrlen` value is larger than the available space in the `info` buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to
