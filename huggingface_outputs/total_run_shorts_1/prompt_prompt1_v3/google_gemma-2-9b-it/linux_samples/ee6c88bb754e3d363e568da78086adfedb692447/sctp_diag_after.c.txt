VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from `&laddr->a` and `&from->ipaddr` into the `info` buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer. If the size of `laddr->a` or `from->ipaddr`
