VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `copy_to_user` function is used to copy data from kernel space to user space. If the size of the data to be copied (`sizeof(ca)`) is larger than the size of the buffer in user space (`argp`), a buffer overflow will occur. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations,
