VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds read
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability. In the loop iterating over `rep->field[i]->usage + j`, the variable `j` is not checked against the bounds of `rep->field[i]->maxusage`. This could lead to an out-of-bounds
