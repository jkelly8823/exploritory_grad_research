VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the size of an inode (`sbi->s_inode_size`) against several conditions. However, the check for `sbi->s_inode_size > blocksize` does not account for potential buffer overflows. If `sbi->s_inode_size` is larger than `blocksize`, it
