VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates through an array `gwj->mod.modfunc` without bounds checking. If the array is larger than `MAX_MODFUNCTIONS`, the loop could access memory beyond the allocated bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.
