VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from `vs_ie` to `ie->ie_buffer`. However, the size of the buffer is not checked before copying. If `vs_ie->len + 2` is larger than the available space in `ie->ie_buffer`, a buffer overflow will occur.
