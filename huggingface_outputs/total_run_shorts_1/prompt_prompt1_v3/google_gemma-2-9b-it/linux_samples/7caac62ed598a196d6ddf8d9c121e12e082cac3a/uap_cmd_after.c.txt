VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5, 10, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the handling of variable-length data. Specifically, the `memcpy` function is used to copy data from `rate_ie` and `wmm_ie` into `bss_cfg->rates` and `bss_cfg->w
