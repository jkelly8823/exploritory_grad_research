VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `if (copy_to_user(_control, control, sizeof(*control)))`  could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `copy_to_user` function copies data from kernel space to user space. If the size of the data being copied (`sizeof(*control)`) is larger than the
