VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 29
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a call to `copy_to_user(_control, control, sizeof(*control))`. This function copies data from kernel space to user space. If the `_control` buffer in user space is smaller than `sizeof(*control)`, a buffer overflow could occur.
