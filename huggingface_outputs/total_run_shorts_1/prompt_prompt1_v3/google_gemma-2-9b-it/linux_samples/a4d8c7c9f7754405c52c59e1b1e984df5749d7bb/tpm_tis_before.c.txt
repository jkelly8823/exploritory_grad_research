VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The lines in question involve setting interrupt vectors (`irq_s` and `irq_e`) based on a read from `ioread8(chip->vendor.iobase + TPM_INT_VECTOR(chip->vendor.locality))`. If the value read from
