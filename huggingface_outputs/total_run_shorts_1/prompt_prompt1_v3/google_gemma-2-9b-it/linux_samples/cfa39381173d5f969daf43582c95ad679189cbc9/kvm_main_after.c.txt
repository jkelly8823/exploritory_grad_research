VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If the `ops->destroy(dev)` function frees the memory associated with `dev`, subsequent access to `dev` within the `if (ret < 0)` block could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior. This is because the memory pointed
