VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the offset `offs` from the `s->base` pointer and then attempts to access memory at `s->base + offs`.  There is no bounds checking to ensure that `offs` does not exceed the allocated size of `s->base`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `offs` is larger
