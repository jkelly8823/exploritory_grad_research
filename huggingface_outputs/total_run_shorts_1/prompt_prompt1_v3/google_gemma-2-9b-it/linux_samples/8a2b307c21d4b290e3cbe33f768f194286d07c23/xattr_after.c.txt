VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the address of a value (`val`) within a buffer (`s->base`) based on the `e_value_offs` field. However, there is no bounds checking to ensure that `offs` (which is derived from `e_value_offs`) does not exceed the size of the buffer. This can
