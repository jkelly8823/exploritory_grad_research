VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Privilege Escalation
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the current user has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. If the user does not have this capability, an error is returned. However, the code does not properly handle the case where the user does have the capability. This could allow a user to escalate their privileges by bypassing the security check.
