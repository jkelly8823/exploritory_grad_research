VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `nlmsg_parse` function call. The function takes several arguments, including the size of the target buffer (`sizeof(*t)`). If this size is larger than the maximum value an integer can hold, an integer overflow can occur. This can lead to buffer overflows or other
