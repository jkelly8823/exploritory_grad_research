VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `nlmsg_parse` function is vulnerable to integer overflow. The function takes a buffer size as an argument, and if the input data exceeds this size, it can lead to a buffer overflow. In this case, the buffer size is `sizeof(*t)`, which is not explicitly defined. If `sizeof(*t)`
