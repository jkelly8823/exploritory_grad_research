VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Variable Redeclaration
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares the variables `limhops` and `err` twice. This is a redundancy and can lead to unexpected behavior if the values are modified in different parts of the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the duplicate declarations of `limhops` and `err`.
