VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when accessing the `crypto_dispatch` array using the `type` variable. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `type` is out of bounds.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking to ensure `type` is within the valid index range of `crypto_dispatch`.
