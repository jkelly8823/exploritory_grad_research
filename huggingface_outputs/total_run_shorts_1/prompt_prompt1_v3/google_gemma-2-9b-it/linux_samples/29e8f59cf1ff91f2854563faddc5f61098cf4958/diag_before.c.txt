VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Recursive call vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a recursive call to the `sk_diag_fill` function within the `sk_for_each` loop. This can lead to a stack overflow if the number of sockets in the `net->packet.sklist` is large enough.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a depth limit for recursive calls to
