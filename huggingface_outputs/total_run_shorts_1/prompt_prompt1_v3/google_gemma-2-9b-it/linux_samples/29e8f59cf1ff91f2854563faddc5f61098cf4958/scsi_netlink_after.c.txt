VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `goto` statements to jump to `next_msg` in multiple places. If the conditions in the `if` statements are never met, the code will continuously jump to `next_msg` without ever executing any other code, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid
