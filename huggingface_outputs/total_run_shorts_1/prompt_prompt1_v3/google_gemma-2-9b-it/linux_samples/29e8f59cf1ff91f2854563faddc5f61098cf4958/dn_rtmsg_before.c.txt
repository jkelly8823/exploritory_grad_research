VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the length of the network message header (`nlh->nlmsg_len`) is less than the size of the header itself or if the length of the skb (`skb->len`) is less than the header length. This check is crucial to prevent buffer overflows. However, the code does not explicitly validate the
