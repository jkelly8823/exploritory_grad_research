VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `kvm_iommu_map_pages` function. The line `gfn += page_size >> PAGE_SHIFT;` calculates a new gfn value by adding the `page_size` (shifted by `PAGE_SHIFT`) to the existing `gfn`.
