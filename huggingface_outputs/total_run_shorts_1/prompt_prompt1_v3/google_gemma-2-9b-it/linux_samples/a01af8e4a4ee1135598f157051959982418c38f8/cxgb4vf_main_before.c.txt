VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19,20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs` and `collect_netdev_mc_list_addrs` functions iterate through network device addresses and store them in the `addr` array. However, the size of the `addr` array is fixed
