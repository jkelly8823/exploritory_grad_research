VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `unix_tot_inflight` is greater than `UNIX_INFLIGHT_TRIGGER_GC`. If it is, a garbage collection is triggered.  There is a risk of integer overflow if `unix_tot_inflight` exceeds the maximum value an `unsigned int` can hold. This could
