VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `con->error_msg = "bad authorize reply";` could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.  Without knowing the size of the `con->error_msg` buffer, it's impossible to say for sure. If the buffer is too small to hold the string "bad authorize reply", it could overflow,
