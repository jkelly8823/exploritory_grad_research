VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `copy_from_user` function is used to copy data from user space to kernel space. However, there is no bounds checking performed on the size of the data being copied. If the `uent->id` buffer is larger than `sizeof(u_ent.id)
