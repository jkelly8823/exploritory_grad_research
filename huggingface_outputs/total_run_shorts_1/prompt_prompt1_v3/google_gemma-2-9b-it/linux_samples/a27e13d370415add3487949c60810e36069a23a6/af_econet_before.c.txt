VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 31-34
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability.  Lines 31-34 calculate the size of the `iov` array and the total size of the data being sent.  If `msg->msg_iovlen` is a very large number, the calculation `size += iov_len
