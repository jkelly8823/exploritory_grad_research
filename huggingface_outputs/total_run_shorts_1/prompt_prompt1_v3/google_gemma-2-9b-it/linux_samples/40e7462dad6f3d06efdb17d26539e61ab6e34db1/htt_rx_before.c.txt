VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Lines 1 and 2 involve accessing memory locations based on the values stored in `skb->data` and `tot_hdr_len`. If these values are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could potentially manipulate them to point to unintended memory locations, leading to
