VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function is used without bounds checking on the destination buffer `dir`. If the input `cpu` is larger than 15, it will lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use `snprintf` instead of `sprintf`. `snprintf` takes an additional argument specifying the buffer size, preventing buffer overflows.
