VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Lines 1 and 2 manipulate the stack pointer (`esp`) using `lea` and `CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET`.  Line 5 pushes a value onto the stack (`pushl_cfi $-1`). Without knowing the
