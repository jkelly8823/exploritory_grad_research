VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function is used without bounds checking on the destination buffer `dir`. If the input `cpu` is larger than 31 characters, it will overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer string formatting function like `snprintf` which takes a buffer size as an argument
