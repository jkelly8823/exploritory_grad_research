VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a `goto` statement to jump to a label named `out`. While this is not inherently a vulnerability, it can lead to issues if the `error` variable is not properly validated. If `error` is a large integer, the jump to `out` could potentially cause an integer overflow, leading to
