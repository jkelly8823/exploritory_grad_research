VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided does not include bounds checking when reading data into the `buffer` variable. This can lead to an integer overflow vulnerability if the length of the symlink is greater than `buflen`. An attacker could craft a symlink longer than `buflen`, causing the write operation to overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent
