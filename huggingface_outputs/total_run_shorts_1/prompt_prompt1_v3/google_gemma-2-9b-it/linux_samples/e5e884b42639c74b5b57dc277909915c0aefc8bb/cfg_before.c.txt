VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The line `for (hw = 0; hw < ARRAY_SIZE(lbs_rates); hw++)` iterates through an array named `lbs_rates`. The vulnerability arises in the line `if (hw_rate == (rates_eid[i+
