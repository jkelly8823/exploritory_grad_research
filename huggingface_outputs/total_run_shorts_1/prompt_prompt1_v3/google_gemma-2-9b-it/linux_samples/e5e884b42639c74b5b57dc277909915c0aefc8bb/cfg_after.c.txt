VULNERABLE_LINES: 19, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the loop iterating through the rates, the expression `hw_rate == (rates_eid[i+2] & 0x7f)` compares a calculated bitrate with a value from the `rates_eid` array. If `rates_
