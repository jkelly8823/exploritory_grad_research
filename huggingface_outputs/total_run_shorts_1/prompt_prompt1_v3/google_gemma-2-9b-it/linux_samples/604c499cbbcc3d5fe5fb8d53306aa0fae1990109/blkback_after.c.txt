VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `preq.nr_sects` (number of sectors) is used in the calculation of the end sector number (`preq.sector_number + preq.nr_sects`). If `preq.nr_sects` is large enough,
