VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates the potential for integer overflow vulnerabilities.  The `maxlen` field is set to `sizeof(int)`, which represents the size of an integer data type. If a user-supplied value exceeds the maximum value an integer can hold, it can lead to an integer overflow. This overflow
