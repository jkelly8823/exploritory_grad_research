VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Logic Error: Premature Return
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a `return NULL;` statement within the `for` loop. This will cause the function to exit prematurely, potentially before iterating through all elements in the `hw_mem_layouts` array. This could lead to incorrect behavior or a failure to find the appropriate memory layout.
