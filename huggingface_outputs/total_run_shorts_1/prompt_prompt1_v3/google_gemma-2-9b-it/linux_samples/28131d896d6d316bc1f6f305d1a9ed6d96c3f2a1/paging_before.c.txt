VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 6, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code performs memory copying operations without proper bounds checking. In both instances of `memcpy`, the source data size (`image->sec[sec_idx].len` and `image->sec[sec_idx].data + offset`) is not validated against the destination buffer size (`fwrt->
