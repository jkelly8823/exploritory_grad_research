VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11, 12, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. In the `iwl_mvm_ftm_resp_size_validation` function, the code compares the received packet length (`pkt_len`) with the size of specific response structures (`sizeof(struct iwl
