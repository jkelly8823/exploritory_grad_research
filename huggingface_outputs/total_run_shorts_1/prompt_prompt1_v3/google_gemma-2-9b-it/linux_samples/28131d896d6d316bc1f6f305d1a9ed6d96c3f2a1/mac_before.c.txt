VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code performs an addition operation (`pub_cfg->grp0 + pub_cfg->grp1`) without considering the potential for integer overflow. If the values of `pub_cfg->grp0` and `pub_cfg->grp1` are large enough, their sum might exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an integer
