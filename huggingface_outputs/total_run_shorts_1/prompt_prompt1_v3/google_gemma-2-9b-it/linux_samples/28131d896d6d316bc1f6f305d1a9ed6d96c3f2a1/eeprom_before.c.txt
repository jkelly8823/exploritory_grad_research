VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `mtd_read` function is called with a specified offset and length. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the provided offset plus the length does not exceed the bounds of the target buffer (`eep`). If the offset is maliciously crafted or the length is
