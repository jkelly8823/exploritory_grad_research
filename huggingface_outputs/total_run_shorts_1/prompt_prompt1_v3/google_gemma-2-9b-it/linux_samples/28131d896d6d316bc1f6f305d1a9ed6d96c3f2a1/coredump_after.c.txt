VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `_ath10k_coredump_get_mem_layout` function. The `for` loop iterates through an array (`hw_mem_layouts`) without checking the bounds of the array. If the array size is larger than expected, the loop could
