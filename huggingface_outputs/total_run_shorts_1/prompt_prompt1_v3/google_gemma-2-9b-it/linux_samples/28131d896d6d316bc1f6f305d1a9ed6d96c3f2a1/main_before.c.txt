VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 40-42
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memset` function is used to fill the `ht_mcs` and `vht_mcs` arrays with a specific pattern. However, the size of these arrays is not explicitly checked before the `memset` operation. If the size of these arrays is smaller
