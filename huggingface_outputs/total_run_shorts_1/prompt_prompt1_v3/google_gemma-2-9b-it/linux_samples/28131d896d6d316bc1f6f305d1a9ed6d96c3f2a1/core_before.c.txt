VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Null Pointer Dereference
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains multiple instances where a pointer (`sta`) is checked for null before being used. However, there's a possibility of a null pointer dereference occurring if the `sta` pointer becomes null after the initial check but before the pointer is used.
