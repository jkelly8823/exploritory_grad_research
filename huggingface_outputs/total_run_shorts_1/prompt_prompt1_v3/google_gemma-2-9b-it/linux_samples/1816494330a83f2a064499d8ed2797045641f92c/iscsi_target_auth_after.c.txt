VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `hex2bin` function is used to convert hexadecimal strings to binary data. However, there is no explicit check on the size of the destination buffer (`challenge_binhex`) before copying the converted binary data. If the converted binary data exceeds the size of `challenge_binhex`, it will overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to
