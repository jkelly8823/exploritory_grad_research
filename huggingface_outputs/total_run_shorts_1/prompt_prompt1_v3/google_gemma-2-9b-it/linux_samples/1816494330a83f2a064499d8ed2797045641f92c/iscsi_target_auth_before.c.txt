VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `chap_string_to_hex` function. This function converts a hexadecimal string to a binary representation. The `DIV_ROUND_UP(len, 2)` calculation determines the size of the destination buffer (`dst`). However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the calculated buffer size is less than or equal to the
