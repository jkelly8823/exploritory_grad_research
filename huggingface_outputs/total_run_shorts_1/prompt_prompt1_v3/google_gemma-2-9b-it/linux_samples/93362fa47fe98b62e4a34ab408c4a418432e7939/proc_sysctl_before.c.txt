VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Loop
EXPLANATION:
The code contains an infinite loop within the `for` loop. The condition `h` is never evaluated, and the `break;` statement is unreachable. This will cause the loop to continue indefinitely.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace the `break;` statement with a condition that evaluates to `true` under certain circumstances.
-
