VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `vsnprintf` function is used to format a string based on a format string and variable arguments. The issue arises when the length of the formatted string (`len`) exceeds the available space in the buffer (`sb->alloc - sb->len`).

In this case, if
