VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares an array `x_new` of pointers to `xfrm_state` structures with a fixed size of `XFRM_MAX_DEPTH`.  Without knowing the value of `XFRM_MAX_DEPTH`, it's impossible to determine if this array is large enough to accommodate all potential inputs.
