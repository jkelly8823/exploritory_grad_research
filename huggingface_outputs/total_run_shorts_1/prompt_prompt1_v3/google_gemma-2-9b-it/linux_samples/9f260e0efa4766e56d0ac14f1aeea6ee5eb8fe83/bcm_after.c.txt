VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into the `bo->procname` buffer, which has a fixed size of 32 bytes. However, the `sock_i_ino(sk)` function returns an unsigned long integer, which can potentially be larger than 32 bytes when represented as a decimal string
