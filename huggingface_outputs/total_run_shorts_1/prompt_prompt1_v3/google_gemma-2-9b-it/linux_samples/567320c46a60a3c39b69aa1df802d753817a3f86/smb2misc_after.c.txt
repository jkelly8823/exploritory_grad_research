VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the `StructureSize2` field of a packet against the expected size for the corresponding SMB2 command. However, the logic for handling `StructureSize2` is incomplete and could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Specifically, the `if` statement on line 14 checks if the `StructureSize2
