VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `lg2ff` using `kfree` but does not check if the allocation was successful. If `kfree` fails, `lg2ff` will be a null pointer, and subsequent attempts to access its members will lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
