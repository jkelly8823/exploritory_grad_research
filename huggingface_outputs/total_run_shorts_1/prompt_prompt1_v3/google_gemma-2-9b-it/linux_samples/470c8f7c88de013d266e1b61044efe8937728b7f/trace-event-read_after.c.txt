VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not include bounds checking when reading data into the `buf` buffer. This means that if `do_read()` returns more data than `buf` can hold, it will write beyond the allocated memory, potentially overwriting other data or causing a crash. This is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.
