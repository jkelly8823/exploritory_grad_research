VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `for_each_element` loop iterates over a sub-element (`sub`) within the `elem` data. The condition `sub->datalen < 4` checks if the sub-element's data length is less than 4 bytes. However, if `
