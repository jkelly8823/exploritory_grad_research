VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4, 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability arises in the `for_each_element` loop, where `elem->data + 1` is used as the starting point for iterating over the sub-elements. 

If `elem->datalen - 1
