VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `for_each_element` function iterates over a sub-element (`sub`) within the `elem` data. The condition `sub->id != 0 || sub->datalen < 4` checks for the sub-element's ID and data length.
