VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `u8 new_bssid[ETH_ALEN];` declares a buffer `new_bssid` of size `ETH_ALEN`. However, the subsequent code lacks bounds checking when copying data into this buffer. If `elem->datalen - 1`
