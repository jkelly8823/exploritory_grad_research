VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If `kmalloc_array` fails to allocate memory for any of the arrays (`vq->indirect`, `vq->log`, or `vq->heads`), the code proceeds to the `goto err_nomem` label. However, the
