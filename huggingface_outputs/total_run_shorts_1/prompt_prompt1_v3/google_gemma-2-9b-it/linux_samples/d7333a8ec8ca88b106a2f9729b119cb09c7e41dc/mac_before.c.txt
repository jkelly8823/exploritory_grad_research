VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The `dma_alloc_coherent` function allocates memory and its corresponding physical address. However, the code lacks a check to ensure that the allocated memory size (`IEEE80211_MAX_FRAME_LEN`) is within the
