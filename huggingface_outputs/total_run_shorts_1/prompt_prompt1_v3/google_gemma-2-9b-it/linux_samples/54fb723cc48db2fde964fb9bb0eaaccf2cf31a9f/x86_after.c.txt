VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `update_cr8_intercept` function. The line `r = 1;` initializes a variable `r` to 1. The subsequent `while (r > 0)` loop continues as long as `r` is greater than 0
