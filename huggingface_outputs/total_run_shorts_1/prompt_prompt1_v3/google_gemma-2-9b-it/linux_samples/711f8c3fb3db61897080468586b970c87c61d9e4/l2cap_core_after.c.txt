VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the value of `psm` against `L2CAP_PSM_LE_DYN_END`. If `psm` is greater than this value, it indicates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that `psm` is within the expected range
