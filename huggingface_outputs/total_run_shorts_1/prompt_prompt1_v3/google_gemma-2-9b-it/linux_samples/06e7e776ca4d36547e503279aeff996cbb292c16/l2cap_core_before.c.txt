VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `memcpy` function call. 
The `memcpy` function copies data from one memory location to another without checking the size of the destination buffer. 
If the `olen` (source length) is greater than the size of the
