VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential use-after-free vulnerability. Specifically, the `zap_pte_range` function call on line 10 might lead to accessing freed memory. The function modifies the `next` pointer, which is then used in the loop condition. If `zap_pte_range`
