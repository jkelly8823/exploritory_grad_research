VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `split_huge_page_pmd` function modifies the `pmd` pointer, potentially freeing the memory it points to. However, the subsequent `if (pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad(pmd))
