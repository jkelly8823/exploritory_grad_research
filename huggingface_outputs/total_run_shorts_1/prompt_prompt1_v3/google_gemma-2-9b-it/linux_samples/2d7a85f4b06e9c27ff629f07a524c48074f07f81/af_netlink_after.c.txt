VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a call to `memcpy_fromiovec`, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the length of the data being copied (`len`) is not properly validated against the available buffer space in `skb`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `len` parameter against the available buffer
