VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a conditional block (`#else`) that handles refcounting logic.  The issue lies in the potential for a use-after-free vulnerability within the block. 

The line `atomic_dec(&r->refs);` decrements the reference count. However,
