VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses mkstemp() to create a temporary file in the "/tmp/" directory. However, the path is constructed using string concatenation without proper sanitization of user-supplied input. This could allow an attacker to craft a filename that traverses outside the intended directory, potentially leading to access to sensitive files or data
