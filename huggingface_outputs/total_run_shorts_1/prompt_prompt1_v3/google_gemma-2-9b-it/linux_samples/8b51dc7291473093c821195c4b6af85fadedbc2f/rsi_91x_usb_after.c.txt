VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `kfree(rsi_dev->tx_buffer)` line frees the memory pointed to by `rsi_dev->tx_buffer`. However, there's a possibility that the code might still access `rsi_dev->tx_buffer` after
