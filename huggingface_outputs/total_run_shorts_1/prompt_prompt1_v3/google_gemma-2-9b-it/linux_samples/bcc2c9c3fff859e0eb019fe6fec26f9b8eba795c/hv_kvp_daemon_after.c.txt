VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `recvfrom` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The code does not check the length of the received data against the size of the `kvp_recv_buffer`. If the received data exceeds the buffer size, it can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
