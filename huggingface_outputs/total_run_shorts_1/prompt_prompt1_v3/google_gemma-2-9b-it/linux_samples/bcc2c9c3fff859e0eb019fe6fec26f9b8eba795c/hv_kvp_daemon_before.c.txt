VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `recv` function call. The `recv` function reads data from a socket into a buffer. In this case, the buffer is `kvp_recv_buffer`, and its size is `sizeof(kvp_recv_buffer)`. If the incoming data exceeds the
