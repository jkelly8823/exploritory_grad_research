VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates `len` times, incrementing `off` in each iteration. If `len` is larger than `vif->hash.size - off`, the loop will access memory beyond the bounds of the `
