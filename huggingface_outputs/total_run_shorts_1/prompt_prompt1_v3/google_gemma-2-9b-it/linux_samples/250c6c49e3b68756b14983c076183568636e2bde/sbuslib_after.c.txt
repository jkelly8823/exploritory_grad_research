VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `__get_user` function is used to read data from user space into kernel space. If the user provides data that exceeds the allocated size of the buffer, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the size of the data being read from user space before using `
