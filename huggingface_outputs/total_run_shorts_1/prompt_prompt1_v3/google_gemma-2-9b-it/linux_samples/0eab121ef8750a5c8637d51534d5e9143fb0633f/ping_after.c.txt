VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the length (`len`) is greater than 0xFFFF. This value represents the maximum size for a 16-bit unsigned integer. If `len` exceeds this limit, an integer overflow can occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a larger data type, such as a 32-bit unsigned integer
