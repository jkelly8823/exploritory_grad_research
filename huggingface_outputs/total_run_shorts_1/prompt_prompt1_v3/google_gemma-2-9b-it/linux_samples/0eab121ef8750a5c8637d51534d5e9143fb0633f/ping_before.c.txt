VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the length (`len`) is greater than 0xFFFF.  If it is, it returns an error. However, the code does not handle the case where `len` is a very large number that could potentially overflow the `int` data type. This could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability.
