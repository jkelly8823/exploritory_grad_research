VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `usb_fill_int_urb` function is used to set up an interrupt transfer request. The `transfer_buffer` argument points to a buffer that will receive data from the device. However, the code does not explicitly specify the size of this buffer. If the data received
