VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the line `skb_pull(skb, ((hdr->hdrlen + 1) << 3));`. 

The `hdr->hdrlen` value is not validated before being used to calculate the number of bytes to pull from the `skb`. If `hdr->hdr
