VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `pskb_expand_head` function call. If the `skb` buffer is not large enough to accommodate the requested expansion, it can lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the `skb` buffer has sufficient space before calling `pskb_
