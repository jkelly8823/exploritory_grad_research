VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `ethlen` variable, which determines the number of bytes to copy, is not properly validated against the size of the destination buffer `dst_u8`. If `ethlen` is larger than the size of `dst_u8`, a buffer overflow will occur,
