VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the lines `crng->init_time = jiffies - CRNG_RESEED_INTERVAL - 1;` and `unsigned long time = random_get_entropy() ^ jiffies;` involve arithmetic operations
