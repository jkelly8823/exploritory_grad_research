VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. In the `else if` block, the code attempts to write a `u16` value to the `data` buffer. However, the buffer size is only 4 bytes (initialized with `unsigned char data[4] = {0};`). If `
