VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of assert statements for error handling.
EXPLANATION:
Assert statements are used for debugging purposes and should not be relied upon for security or error handling in production code. If an assert statement fails, the program will typically terminate abruptly, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace assert statements with more robust error handling
