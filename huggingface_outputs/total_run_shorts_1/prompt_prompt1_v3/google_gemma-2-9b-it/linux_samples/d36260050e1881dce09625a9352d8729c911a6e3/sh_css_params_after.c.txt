VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ia_css_stream_isp_parameters_init` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of `out_infos` array without proper bounds checking. The code assigns a pointer to `args->out_frame[0]->info` to `out_infos`, but it doesn't verify the size of `out
