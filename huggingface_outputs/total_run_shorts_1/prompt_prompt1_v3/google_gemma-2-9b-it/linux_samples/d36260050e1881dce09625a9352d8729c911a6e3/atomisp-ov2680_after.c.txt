VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11,12,13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the `if (data_length != OV2680_8BIT && data_length != OV2680_16BIT)` block, the variable `len` is calculated as `data_length + sizeof
