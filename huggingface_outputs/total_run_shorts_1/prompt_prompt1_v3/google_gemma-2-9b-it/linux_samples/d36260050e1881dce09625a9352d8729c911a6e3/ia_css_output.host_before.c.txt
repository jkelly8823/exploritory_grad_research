VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `to->width_a_over_b = elems_a / to->port_b.elems;`  is susceptible to an integer overflow. If `elems_a` is significantly larger than `to->port_b.elems, the division operation could result in a value that exceeds the maximum representable
