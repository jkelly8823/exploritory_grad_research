VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `clipcount` is not initialized before being used in a loop condition. If `clipcount` is a large value, the loop may run for an excessive number of iterations, potentially leading to an integer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initialize `clipcount`
