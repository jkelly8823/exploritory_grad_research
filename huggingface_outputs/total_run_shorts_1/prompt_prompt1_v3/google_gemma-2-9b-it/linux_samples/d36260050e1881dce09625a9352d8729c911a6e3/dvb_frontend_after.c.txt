VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY: Out-of-Bounds Read
EXPLANATION:
The code iterates through an array `tvp` using a for loop. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access elements of the array. However, there is no check to ensure that `i` does not exceed the bounds of the array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read
