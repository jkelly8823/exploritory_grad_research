VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `ARRAY_SIZE(array)` to determine the size of the array. However, it does not check if the array is NULL or if it has a valid size. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the array is NULL or has a size of zero.
