VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the calculation of `FPNTBL_BYTES` and `SCTBL_BYTES`. These calculations determine the size of buffers used to store image data. 

Without the full context of the code, it's impossible to definitively say if an overflow will occur. However, the way these calculations are structured raises
