VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write
EXPLANATION:
The code iterates through an array `tvp` using a for loop. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access elements of the array. However, there is a potential for an out-of-bounds write if `tvps->num` is larger than the allocated size of the `
