VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential infinite recursion
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential infinite recursion issue. The `resizer_configure_in_continious_mode` function calls itself within the `if` statement. This can lead to an infinite loop if the condition `ipipeif_source == IPIPEIF_OUTPUT_RESIZER` is always true or false
