VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of assert statements for error handling.
EXPLANATION:
Assert statements are typically used for debugging purposes and should not be relied upon for production error handling. If an assert statement fails, the program will typically terminate abruptly, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to diagnose the issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace assert statements with more robust error handling
