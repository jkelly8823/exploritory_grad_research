VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to access `ctx->ring_pages[0]` after freeing `iocb`.  It's possible that `ctx->ring_pages` is allocated alongside `iocb` or is otherwise dependent on its existence.  Freeing `iocb` could lead to a dangling pointer
