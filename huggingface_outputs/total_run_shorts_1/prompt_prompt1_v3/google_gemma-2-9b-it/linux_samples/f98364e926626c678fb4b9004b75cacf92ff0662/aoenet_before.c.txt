VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `pr_warn` function is likely not performing bounds checking on the input strings. If the `ifp->name` or the string "consider increasing tx_queue_len" are longer than the buffer allocated for `pr_warn`, a buffer overflow could occur. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
