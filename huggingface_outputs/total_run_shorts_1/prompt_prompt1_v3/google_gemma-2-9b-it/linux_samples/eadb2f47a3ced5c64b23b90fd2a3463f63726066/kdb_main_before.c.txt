VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `permissions &= KDB_ENABLE_MASK;` performs a bitwise AND operation between the `permissions` variable and `KDB_ENABLE_MASK`. If `permissions` is larger than the size of `KDB_ENABLE_MASK`, an integer overflow could occur. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security
