VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `copy_from_user` function is used to copy data from user space to kernel space. The size of the data being copied is determined by `sizeof(arg64.LUN_info)`. However, there is no check to ensure that the size of the destination buffer
