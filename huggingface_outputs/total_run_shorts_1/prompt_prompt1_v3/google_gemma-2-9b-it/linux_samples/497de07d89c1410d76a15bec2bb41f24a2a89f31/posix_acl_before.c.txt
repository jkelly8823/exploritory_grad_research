VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `error = posix_acl_equiv_mode(acl, &inode->i_mode);`  has the potential for an integer overflow. The `posix_acl_equiv_mode` function's return value is an integer, and if it exceeds the maximum value an integer can hold, an overflow will occur
