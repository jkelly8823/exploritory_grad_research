VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for an integer overflow when calculating the total size of relocations. The condition `exec[i].relocation_count > INT_MAX / sizeof(struct drm_i915_gem_relocation_entry)` is designed to prevent overflow. However, it relies on the assumption that `exec[
