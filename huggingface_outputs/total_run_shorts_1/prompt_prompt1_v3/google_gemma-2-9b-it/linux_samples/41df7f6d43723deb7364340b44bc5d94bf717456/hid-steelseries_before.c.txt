VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `goto` statements to jump to a label named `err_free`. If the condition in the `if` statement is always true, the code will repeatedly jump to `err_free`, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace `goto` statements with more structured control
