VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `goto` statements to jump to an error handling section (`err_free`). If the conditions in the `if` statements are not met, the code will repeatedly jump to `err_free`, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a `while
