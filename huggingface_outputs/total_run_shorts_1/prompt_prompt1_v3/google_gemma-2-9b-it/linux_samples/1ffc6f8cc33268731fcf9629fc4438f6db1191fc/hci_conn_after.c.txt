VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet you provided uses the `bacmp()` function, which is a function for comparing Bluetooth addresses.  While not inherently vulnerable, the use of `bacmp()` without proper bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. If the input `dst` is maliciously crafted to be longer than the
