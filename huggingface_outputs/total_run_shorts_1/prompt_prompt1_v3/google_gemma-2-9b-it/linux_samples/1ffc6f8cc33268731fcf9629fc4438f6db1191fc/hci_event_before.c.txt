VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `hci_proto_connect_ind` function is not shown in the provided code snippet. It is unclear how this function handles the `&ev->bdaddr` argument. If `hci_proto_connect_ind` does not properly validate the length of the `bdaddr` data, a buffer overflow vulnerability could exist.
