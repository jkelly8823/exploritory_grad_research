VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `if (right_info && !right_info->bitmap &&` is incomplete, suggesting that there might be missing code or logic following this conditional statement. If the missing code involves operations that write data to `right_info`, without proper bounds checking, it could
