VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. In the `error_decode` block, `kfree(cert->pub->key)` and `kfree(ctx)` are used to free memory allocated for `cert->pub->key` and `ctx` respectively. However, the code does not guarantee that these allocations will always
