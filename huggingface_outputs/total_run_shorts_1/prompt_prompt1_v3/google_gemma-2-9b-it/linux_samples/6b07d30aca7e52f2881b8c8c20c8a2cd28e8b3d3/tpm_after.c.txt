VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Lines 7 and 8 perform a direct memory access operation using `*((__be32 *) (buf + 2))` and `*((__be32 *) (buf + 6))`.  Without bounds checking, if the `buf` buffer is smaller than
