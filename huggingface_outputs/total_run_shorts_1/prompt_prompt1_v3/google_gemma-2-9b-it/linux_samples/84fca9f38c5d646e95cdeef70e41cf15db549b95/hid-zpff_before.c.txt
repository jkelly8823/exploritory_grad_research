VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The variable `zpff` is allocated memory using `kzalloc`. However, if `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory (returning `NULL`), the code proceeds to use `zpff` without checking if it's valid. This can lead
