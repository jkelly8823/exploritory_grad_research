VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. The `kzalloc()` function is used to allocate memory for a `struct zpff_device`. However, if the allocation fails (`if (!zpff)`), the code does not handle the case where memory was not successfully allocated. This could lead to a memory leak if the `zp
