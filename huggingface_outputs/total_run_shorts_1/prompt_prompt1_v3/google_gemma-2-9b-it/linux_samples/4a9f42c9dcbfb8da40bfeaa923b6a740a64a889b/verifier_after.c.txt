VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in `check_flow_keys_access` function.
EXPLANATION:
The `check_flow_keys_access` function does not adequately validate the size parameter. If an attacker can control the `size` argument, they could potentially write beyond the bounds of the `struct bpf_flow_keys` structure, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the
