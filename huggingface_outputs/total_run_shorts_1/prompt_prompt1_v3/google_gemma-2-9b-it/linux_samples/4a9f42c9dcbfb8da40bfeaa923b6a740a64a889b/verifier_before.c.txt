VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `memcpy()` without proper bounds checking. The `memcpy()` function copies data from one memory location to another without verifying the size of the destination buffer. If the source data is larger than the destination buffer, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds
