VULNERABLE_LINES: 19, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of indefinite length data. 
The vulnerability arises in the loop that decodes the length of indefinite length data. The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is calculated as `len - 0x80`. If `n
