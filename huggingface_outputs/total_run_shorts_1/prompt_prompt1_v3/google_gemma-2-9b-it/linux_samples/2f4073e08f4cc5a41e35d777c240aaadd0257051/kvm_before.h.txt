VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a structure `riscv_sbi` with a `padding` array of size 256. This padding is not dynamically allocated and its size is fixed. If the input data to this structure exceeds 256 bytes, it will lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
