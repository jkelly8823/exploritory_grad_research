VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for insecure deserialization.
EXPLANATION: The code directly assigns the value of `rsp->SecurityMode` to `server->sec_mode` without any validation or sanitization. This could lead to an insecure deserialization vulnerability if `rsp->SecurityMode` contains malicious data. An attacker could craft a specially crafted SMB2 response to manipulate the `Security
