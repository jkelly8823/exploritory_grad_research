VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a call to `cifs_get_inode_info` which takes a buffer (`buf`) as an argument. There is no explicit check on the size of the buffer before passing it to the function. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the data returned by `cifs_get_inode_
