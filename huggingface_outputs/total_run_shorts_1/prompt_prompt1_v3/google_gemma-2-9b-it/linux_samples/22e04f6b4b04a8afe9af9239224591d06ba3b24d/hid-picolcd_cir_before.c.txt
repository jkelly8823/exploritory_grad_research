VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to unregister a device (`rc_unregister_device(rdev)`) after setting the `data->rc_dev` pointer to NULL. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability because `rdev` might still be referencing memory that has already been freed.
