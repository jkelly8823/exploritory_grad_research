VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `holtekff->field->value[i] = data[i];` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The code iterates through the `data` array and copies its contents into the `holtekff->field->value` array. However, there is no check on the size of the `data` array
