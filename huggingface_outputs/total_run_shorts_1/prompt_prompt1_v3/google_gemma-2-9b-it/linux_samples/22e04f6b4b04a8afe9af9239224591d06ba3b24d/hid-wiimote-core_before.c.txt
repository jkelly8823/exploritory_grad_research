VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `sprintf` function calls.  The `sprintf` function does not have bounds checking on its output, meaning that if the format string or the provided arguments are larger than the allocated buffer, it can write beyond the intended memory space. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary
