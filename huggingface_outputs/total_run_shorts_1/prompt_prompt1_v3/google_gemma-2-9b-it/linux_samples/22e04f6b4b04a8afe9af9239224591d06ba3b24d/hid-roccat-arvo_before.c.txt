VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strict_strtoul` function is used to parse a string (`buf`) into an unsigned long integer. However, there is no explicit bounds checking on the input `buf`. If an attacker provides a maliciously crafted input string that exceeds the allocated memory for `state`,
