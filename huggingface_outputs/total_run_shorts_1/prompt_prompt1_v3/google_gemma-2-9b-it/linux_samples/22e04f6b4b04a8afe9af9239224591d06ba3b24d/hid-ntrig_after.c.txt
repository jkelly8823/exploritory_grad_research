VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly uses `kstrtoul` to parse a string (`buf`) into an unsigned long (`val`).  It then compares `val` against various limits (e.g., `nd->sensor_physical_width`, `0x7f`).  If `buf` contains a value larger than the maximum representable by `unsigned long`, an integer overflow
