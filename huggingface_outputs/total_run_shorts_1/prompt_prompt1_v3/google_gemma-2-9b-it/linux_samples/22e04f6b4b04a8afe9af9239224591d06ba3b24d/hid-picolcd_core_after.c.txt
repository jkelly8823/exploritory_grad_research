VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `buf += 10;` increments the size of the buffer `buf` by 10 bytes. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the buffer has sufficient space to accommodate this increase. If the buffer is already full, this operation could lead to
