VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `strict_strtoul` to parse a string (`buf`) into an unsigned long integer (`profile`).  While `strict_strtoul` helps prevent buffer overflows, it doesn't inherently protect against integer overflows. If the input string `buf` represents a number larger than the maximum value an `unsigned
