VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `strict_strtoul` to parse an integer from a buffer (`buf`).  While `strict_strtoul` helps prevent buffer overflows, it doesn't inherently protect against integer overflows. If the input buffer (`buf`) contains a value larger than the maximum representable value for the
