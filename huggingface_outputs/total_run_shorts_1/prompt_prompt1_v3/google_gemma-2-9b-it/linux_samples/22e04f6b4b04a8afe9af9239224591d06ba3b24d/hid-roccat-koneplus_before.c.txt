VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `strict_strtoul` to parse a string (`buf`) into an unsigned long integer (`profile`).  There is no bound check on the parsed value before it is used in a comparison (`if (profile > 4)`). This could lead to an integer overflow if the input string `buf` represents a
