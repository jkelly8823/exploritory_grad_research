VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `unit_expo` is less than 0x08. If it is, it returns `unit_expo` directly. Otherwise, it doesn't perform any checks or bounds validation before returning the value. This can lead to an integer overflow if `unit_expo` is a large value.
