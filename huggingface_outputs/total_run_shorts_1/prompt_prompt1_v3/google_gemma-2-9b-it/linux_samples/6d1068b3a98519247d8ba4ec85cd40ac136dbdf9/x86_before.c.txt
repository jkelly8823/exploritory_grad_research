VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not explicitly show an integer overflow vulnerability. However, the code snippet sets the `dt.size` variable twice, first with the IDT limit and then with the GDT limit.  Without knowing the sizes of these structures and the potential values of `sregs->idt.limit` and `sregs->gdt.limit`, it is impossible to definitively rule
