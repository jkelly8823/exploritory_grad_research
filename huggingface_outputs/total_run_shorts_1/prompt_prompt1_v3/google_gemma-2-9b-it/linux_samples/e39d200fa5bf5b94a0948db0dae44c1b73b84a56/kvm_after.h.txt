VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from the `val` pointer to the `__entry->val` buffer. However, the size of the copy is determined by `min_t(u32, sizeof(__entry->val), len)`, which could allow an attacker to
