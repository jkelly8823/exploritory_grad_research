VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates `redir_index` by shifting `ioapic->ioregsel - 0x10` by one bit to the right. If `ioapic->ioregsel` is large enough, this shift operation could result in an integer overflow, leading to an unexpected value for `redir_index`.
