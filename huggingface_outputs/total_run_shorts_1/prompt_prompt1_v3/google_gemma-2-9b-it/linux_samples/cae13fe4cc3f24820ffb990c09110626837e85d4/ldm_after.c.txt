VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `f->map &= 0x7F;` performs a bitwise AND operation with `0x7F`. This operation could lead to an integer overflow if `f->map` is already large enough that the result exceeds the maximum value representable by the data type of `f->map`.
