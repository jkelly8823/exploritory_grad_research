VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19, 23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential for buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
Lines 19 and 23 use `sprintf` to format a string into a fixed-size buffer (`buffer`). The size of the buffer is determined by a literal value (`sizeof("nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:nnnnn")`), which is 32 bytes.
