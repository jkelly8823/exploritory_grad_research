VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Lines 6, 7, and 8 involve copying data from `f->event_mask` into `uf.event_mask` using pointer arithmetic.  

Without knowing the size of `f->event_mask` or `uf.event_mask
