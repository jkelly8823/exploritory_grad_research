VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the loop condition `i < adapter->num_rx_queues`. If `adapter->num_rx_queues` is a very large number, the loop might iterate beyond the intended bounds, leading to an integer overflow. This could result in unexpected behavior or even a crash.
