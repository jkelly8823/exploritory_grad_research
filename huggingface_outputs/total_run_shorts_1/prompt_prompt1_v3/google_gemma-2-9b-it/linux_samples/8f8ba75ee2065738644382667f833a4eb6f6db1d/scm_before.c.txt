VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates through a range of file descriptors (`fdmax`) and accesses memory pointed to by `cmfptr`.  The loop condition `i < fdmax` does not explicitly check the bounds of the memory region pointed to by `cmfptr`. If `fdmax` is
