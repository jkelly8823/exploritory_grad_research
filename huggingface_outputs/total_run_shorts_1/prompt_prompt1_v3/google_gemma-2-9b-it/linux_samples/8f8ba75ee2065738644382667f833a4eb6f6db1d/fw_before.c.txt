VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strsep()` function, when used without proper bounds checking, can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string (`options`) is longer than the allocated buffer size.

In this case, the `strsep()` function is used to split the `options` string based on commas
