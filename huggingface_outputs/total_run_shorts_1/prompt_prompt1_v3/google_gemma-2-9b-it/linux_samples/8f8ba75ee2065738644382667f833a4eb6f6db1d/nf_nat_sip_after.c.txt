VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16, 22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
Lines 16 and 22 demonstrate potential buffer overflows. The `sprintf` function is used without a proper bounds check on the size of the `buffer` array. If the formatted string exceeds the size of the buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory
