VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `copy_from_user` function is used to copy data from user space to kernel space. If the `uifc32` buffer provided by the user is larger than the `ifc32` buffer, a buffer overflow will occur. This can allow an attacker
