VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the packet length exceeds the device's MTU. However, if the packet is not a GSO packet, it calls `kfree_skb(skb)`, which frees the skb without ensuring that the skb's data is properly deallocated. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the skb contains uninitialized
