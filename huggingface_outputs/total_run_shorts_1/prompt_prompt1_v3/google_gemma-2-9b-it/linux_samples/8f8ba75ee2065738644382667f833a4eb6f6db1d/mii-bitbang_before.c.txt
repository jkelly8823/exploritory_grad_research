VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `new_bus->phy_mask = ~0;`  sets the `phy_mask` member of the `new_bus` structure to the bitwise complement of 0, which is effectively all bits set to 1. This could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the size of the `phy_mask
