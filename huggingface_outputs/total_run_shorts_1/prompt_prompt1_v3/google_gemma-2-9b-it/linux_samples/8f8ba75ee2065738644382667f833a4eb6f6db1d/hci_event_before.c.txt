VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 10, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains calls to functions like `mgmt_remote_name` and `hci_resolve_name` which may involve string manipulation. Without knowing the exact implementation of these functions, it's impossible to definitively say if they are vulnerable to buffer overflows. However, the
