VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `ev = llc_station_ev(skb);` allocates memory for an `llc_station_state_ev` structure using `llc_station_ev(skb)`. However, the code does not explicitly check the size of the allocated memory or the size of the data being copied into the structure
