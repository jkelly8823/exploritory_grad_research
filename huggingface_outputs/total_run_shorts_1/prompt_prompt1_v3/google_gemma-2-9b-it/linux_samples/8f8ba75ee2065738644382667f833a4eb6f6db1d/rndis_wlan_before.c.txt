VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The `krealloc` function is used to resize the `pmkids` buffer. However, the calculation of the new buffer size (`newlen`) does not account for potential buffer overflows. If `count` is a very large number, `new
