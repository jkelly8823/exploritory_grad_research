VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the `bi_length` against `escan_buflen - WL_ESCAN_RESULTS_FIXED_SIZE`. If `bi_length` is not equal to this value, it logs an error and exits. However, there is no check to ensure that `bi_length` is within the bounds
