VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the length of `bss_info_le` against the expected size based on `escan_result_le->buflen`. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the `bss_info_le` pointer itself. This means that if `bss_info_le` points to a memory
