VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code assumes that `task->mm` is valid. If `task->mm` is freed before the code executes the `if` statement, accessing `task->mm` will lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This can result in crashes or arbitrary code execution.
