VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the `asm volatile` instruction to perform a DIAG operation. The `srl` instruction shifts the result of the `diag` operation right by 28 bits. This can lead to an integer overflow if the result of the `diag` operation is large enough.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Limit the number of
