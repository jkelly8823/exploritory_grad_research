VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `syscall_get_arguments` function is responsible for retrieving syscall arguments from the target task's stack. However, the code lacks bounds checking on the `args` array, which has a fixed size of 6 elements. If a syscall requires more than 6
