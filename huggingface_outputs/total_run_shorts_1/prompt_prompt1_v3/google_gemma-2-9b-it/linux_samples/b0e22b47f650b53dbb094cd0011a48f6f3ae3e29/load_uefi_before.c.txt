VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `dbx` but does not deallocate it if `efi_rt_services_supported` returns false. This can lead to a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure `dbx` is deallocated using `kfree(dbx)` within the `if` statement's block.
