VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `uefi_blacklist_hash` function call appears to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The function takes four arguments: `source`, `data`, `len`, and a string literal `"bin:", 4`.  The issue lies in the potential for `len` to be larger than the allocated buffer for `data`.
