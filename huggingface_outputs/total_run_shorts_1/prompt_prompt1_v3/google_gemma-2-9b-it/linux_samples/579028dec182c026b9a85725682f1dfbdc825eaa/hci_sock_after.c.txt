VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Error Handling
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `sk->sk_err = EPIPE` and `sk->sk_state = BT_OPEN` without properly handling the potential consequences of this action. Setting `sk->sk_err = EPIPE` indicates a broken pipe, which might lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent operations involving the socket.
