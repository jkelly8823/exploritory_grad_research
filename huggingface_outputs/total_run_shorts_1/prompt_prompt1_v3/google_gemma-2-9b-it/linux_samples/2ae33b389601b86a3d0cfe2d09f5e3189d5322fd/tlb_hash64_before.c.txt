VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided does not include any explicit checks for potential integer overflows. However, the `user_segment_size(addr)` and `get_kernel_vsid(addr, mmu_kernel_ssize)` functions are not shown. These functions could potentially return values that, when used in subsequent calculations (e
