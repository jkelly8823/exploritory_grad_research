VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8,9,10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the `smbios_present` function, the line `dmi_ver = (buf[6] << 8) + buf[7];` calculates the `dmi_ver` variable by shifting `buf[6]` eight bits to the
