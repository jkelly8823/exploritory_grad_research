VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a macro `C` that reads a register value and checks a bit. However, the variable `status` used in the macro is not declared or initialized within the provided snippet. This suggests a potential use-after-free vulnerability. If `status` is a dynamically allocated memory location, it might
