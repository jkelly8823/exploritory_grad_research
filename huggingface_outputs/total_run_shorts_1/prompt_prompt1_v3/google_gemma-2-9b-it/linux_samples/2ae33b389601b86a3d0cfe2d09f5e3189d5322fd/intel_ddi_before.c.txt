VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `val = I915_READ(DDI_BUF_CTL(port));` reads data from memory location `DDI_BUF_CTL(port)`. If the size of the `val` variable is smaller than the data read from memory, it can lead to
