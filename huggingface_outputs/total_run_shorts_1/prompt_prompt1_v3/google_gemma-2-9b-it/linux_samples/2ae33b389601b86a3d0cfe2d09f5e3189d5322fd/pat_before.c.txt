VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if a base address is greater than a calculated high memory address. The calculation `__pa(high_memory-1)` could potentially lead to an integer overflow if `high_memory` is a large value.  An overflow could result in an incorrect comparison, potentially allowing for memory access beyond the intended bounds
