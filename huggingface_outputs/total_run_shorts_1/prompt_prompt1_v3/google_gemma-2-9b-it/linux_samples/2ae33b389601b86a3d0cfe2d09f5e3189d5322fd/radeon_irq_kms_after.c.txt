VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Repetitive Code
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet demonstrates a pattern of repetitive code. Multiple nearly identical blocks of code exist, each handling a different aspect of interrupt handling. This repetition increases the likelihood of errors and makes it harder to maintain and update the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Extract Common Logic:** Identify the common operations performed in each block and extract them into a separate function. This will reduce redundancy and
