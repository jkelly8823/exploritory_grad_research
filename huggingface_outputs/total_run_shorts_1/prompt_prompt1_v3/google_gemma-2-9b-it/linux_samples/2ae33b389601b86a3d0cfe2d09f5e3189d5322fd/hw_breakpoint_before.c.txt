VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `smp_call_function_single` function expects an integer argument representing the CPU ID. However, the code directly casts the `(int)cpu` value to an integer without any bounds checking. This can lead to an integer overflow if the `cpu` value is larger than the maximum supported CPU ID.
