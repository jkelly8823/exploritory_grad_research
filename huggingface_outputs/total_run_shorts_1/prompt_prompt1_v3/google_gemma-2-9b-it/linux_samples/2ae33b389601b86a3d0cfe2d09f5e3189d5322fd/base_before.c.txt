VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability.  If `ret` is 0, the code proceeds to decrement the `engine->refcount` atomically. However, there's no guarantee that `engine` is still valid after this operation. If `engine` is freed
