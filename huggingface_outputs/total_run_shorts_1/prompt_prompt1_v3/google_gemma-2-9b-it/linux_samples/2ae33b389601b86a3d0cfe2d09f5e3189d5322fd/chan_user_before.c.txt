VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `write(thread_fd, &c, sizeof(c))` statement attempts to write a single character (`c`) with a size of `sizeof(c)`, which is 1 byte. However, the `write` system call can return a value greater than the
