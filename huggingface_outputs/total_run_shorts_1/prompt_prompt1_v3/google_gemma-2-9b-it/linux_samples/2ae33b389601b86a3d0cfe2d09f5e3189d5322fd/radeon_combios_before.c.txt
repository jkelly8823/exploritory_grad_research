VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be checking for a value in a variable called 'found'. If 'found' is 1, it proceeds with a specific action. Otherwise, it falls back to a different function call. This logic doesn't inherently present any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
