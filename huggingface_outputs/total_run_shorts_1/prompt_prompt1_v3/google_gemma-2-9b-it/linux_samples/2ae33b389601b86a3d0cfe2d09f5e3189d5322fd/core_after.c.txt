VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `rng_get_data` function is called without bounds checking on the size of the data being read into the `rng_buffer`. If `rng_get_data` returns more data than the allocated size of `rng_
