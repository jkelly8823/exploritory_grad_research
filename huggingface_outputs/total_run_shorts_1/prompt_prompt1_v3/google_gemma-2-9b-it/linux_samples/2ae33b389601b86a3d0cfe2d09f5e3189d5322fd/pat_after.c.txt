VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if a given base address is within the valid kernel memory range. However, the condition `(__pa(high_memory-1) <= base + size)` could lead to an out-of-bounds write if `size` is large enough. 

If `size` exceeds the remaining
