VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when accessing memory locations. The `mwait_ptr` pointer is not validated before use, which could lead to a buffer overflow if it points to an invalid memory address.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that `mwait_ptr` is initialized to a valid memory address before use.
- Implement bounds checking when accessing memory through `mwait_
