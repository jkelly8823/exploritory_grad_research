VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8,9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `dmi_ver`. 

Line 7: `dmi_ver = (buf[6] << 8) + buf[7];`

This line shifts the value of `buf[6]` by 8 bits (left
