VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In line 1, `divisor` is calculated as the result of dividing `parent_rate` by `rate`. If `parent_rate` is significantly larger than `rate`, the result of this division could exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an integer variable
