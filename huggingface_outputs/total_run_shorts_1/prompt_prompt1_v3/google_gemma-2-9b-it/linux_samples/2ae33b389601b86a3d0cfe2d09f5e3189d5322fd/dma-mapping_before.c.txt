VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `__alloc_from_contiguous` and `__alloc_remap_buffer` functions are called without proper bounds checking on the input size (`pool->size`). If an attacker can manipulate the value of `pool->size` to exceed the allocated buffer size,
