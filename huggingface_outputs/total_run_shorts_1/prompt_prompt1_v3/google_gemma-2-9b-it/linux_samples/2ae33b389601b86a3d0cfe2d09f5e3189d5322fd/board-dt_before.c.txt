VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Use After Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `of_find_compatible_node` function allocates memory for the `device_node` structure. However, the code does not explicitly free this memory after it is used.
