VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 21, 22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. In the loop iterating through the TOC entries, the line `*toc_entry = *toc_entry + offset;` adds the `offset` value to the current TOC entry. If the `offset` value is large enough, it could cause an integer
