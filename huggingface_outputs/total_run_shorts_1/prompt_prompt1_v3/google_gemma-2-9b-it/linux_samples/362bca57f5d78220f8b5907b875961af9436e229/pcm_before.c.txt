VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `err` is assigned a value of `-ENXIO` (which is a negative integer) and then potentially overwritten by the result of `snd_pcm_info_user(substream, info)`. If `snd_
