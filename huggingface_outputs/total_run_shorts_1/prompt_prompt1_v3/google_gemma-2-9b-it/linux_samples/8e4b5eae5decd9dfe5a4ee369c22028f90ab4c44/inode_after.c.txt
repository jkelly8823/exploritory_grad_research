VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION:
The use of a `goto` statement to jump directly to a label named `bad_inode` without any clear exit condition can lead to an infinite loop. If the conditions that would normally prevent the jump to `bad_inode` are not met, the code will repeatedly execute the code block leading up to the `goto`
