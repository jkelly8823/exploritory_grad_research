VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION:
The `goto bad_inode;` statement creates a potential for an infinite loop if the conditions leading to this jump are not carefully managed. Without seeing the code that defines `bad_inode`, it's impossible to say for sure if this is a problem. However, if `bad_inode` doesn't have proper
