VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `val |= CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN;`  may lead to an integer overflow. The `val` variable is not initialized, and the bitwise OR operation (`|=`) with `CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN` could potentially result in a value exceeding the maximum representable value for the
