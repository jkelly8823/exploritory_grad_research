VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 21,22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if an interrupt number (`irq`) is within a valid range. However, the check `irq < VGIC_NR_SGIS || irq >= vcpu->kvm->arch.vgic.nr_irqs` could lead to an integer overflow if `VGIC_NR_SGIS
