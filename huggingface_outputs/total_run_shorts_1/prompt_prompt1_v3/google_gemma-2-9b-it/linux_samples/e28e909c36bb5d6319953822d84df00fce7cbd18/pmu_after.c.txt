VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 21,22,23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for a valid interrupt number. However, it lacks bounds checking on the `irq` variable. If `irq` is a very large number, it could potentially overflow the `vcpu->arch.pmu.irq_num` variable, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.
