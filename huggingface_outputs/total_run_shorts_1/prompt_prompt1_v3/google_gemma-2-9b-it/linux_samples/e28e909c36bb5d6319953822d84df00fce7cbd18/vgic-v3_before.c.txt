VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between a 64-bit value (`val`) and a 32-bit mask (`ICH_LR_VIRTUALID_MASK`). If `val` is greater than or equal to 2^32, this operation can result in an integer overflow, leading
