VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `sk_rcvqueues_full` function checks if the receive queues for the socket (`sk`) are full. If they are, the code attempts to increment a UDP6 statistics counter (`__UDP6_INC_STATS`). However, without seeing the full implementation of `__UDP
