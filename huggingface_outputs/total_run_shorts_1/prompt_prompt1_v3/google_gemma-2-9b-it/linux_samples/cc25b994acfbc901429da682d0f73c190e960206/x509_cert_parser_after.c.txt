VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `mktime64` function call. The `*_t` variable is not explicitly defined, and its size is unknown. If `mktime64` returns a value larger than the allocated memory for `
