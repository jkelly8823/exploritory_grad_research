VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `merge_64` macro can lead to integer overflow. When merging two 32-bit unsigned integers, the result should be a 64-bit unsigned integer. However, the macro uses bitwise operations and addition, which can overflow if the sum of the two 32-bit integers exceeds the
