VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `parser->global.report_id` is within the valid range (0 to HID_MAX_IDS - 1). However, if `parser->global.report_id` is equal to HID_MAX_IDS, the check will fail, leading to an integer overflow.
