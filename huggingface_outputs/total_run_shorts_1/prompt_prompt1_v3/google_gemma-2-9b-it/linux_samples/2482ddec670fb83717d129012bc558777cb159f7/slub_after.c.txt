VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the `freelist_ptr` function. When calculating the obfuscated freelist pointer, it performs a bitwise XOR operation between the input pointer, a random number per cache (`s->random`), and the address where the pointer is held (`ptr_addr`).  

If `ptr_addr`
