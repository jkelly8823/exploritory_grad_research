VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks context regarding the size and contents of `frag->len` and the `len` variable.  Without knowing their data types and how they are initialized, it's impossible to definitively say if a buffer overflow will occur. However, the line `frag->len -= len;`  suggests a potential
