VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks context regarding the size and initialization of the `frag->len` variable. If `frag->len` is not properly bounded or validated, a malicious actor could potentially provide a value for `len` that exceeds the allocated memory for `frag->len`, leading to a buffer overflow.
