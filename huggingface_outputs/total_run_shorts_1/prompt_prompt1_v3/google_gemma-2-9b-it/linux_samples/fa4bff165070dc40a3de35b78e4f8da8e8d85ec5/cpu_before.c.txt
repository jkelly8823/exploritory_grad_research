VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function is vulnerable to buffer overflow if the format string is not properly sanitized. In this case, the `buf` variable is not checked for size before being used with `sprintf`. If the format string contains more characters than `buf` can hold, it will overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code
