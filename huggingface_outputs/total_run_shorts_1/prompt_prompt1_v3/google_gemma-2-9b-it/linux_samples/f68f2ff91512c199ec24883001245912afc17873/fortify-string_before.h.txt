VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `strcpy` function does not properly handle potential buffer overflows. 
EXPLANATION:
The `strcpy` function copies the contents of the source string (`q`) to the destination string (`p`) without checking if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the entire source string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer string
