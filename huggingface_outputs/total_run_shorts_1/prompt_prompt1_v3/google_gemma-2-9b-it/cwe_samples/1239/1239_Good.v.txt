VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-15, 18-23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability.  The lines in question repeatedly assign values to the `data` array, which appears to be 16 bytes long.  Without knowing the source of the values being assigned, it's impossible to definitively say
