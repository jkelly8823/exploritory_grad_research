VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly constructs a file path using the `downloadedFilePath` variable without any sanitization or validation. This opens the door to a path traversal attack, where an attacker could provide a malicious `downloadedFilePath` that leads to accessing or modifying files outside the intended directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the `downloadedFilePath`
