VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `realloc` function is used to resize the `cleartext_buffer`. If `get_secret()` returns a value larger than the current size of `cleartext_buffer`, `realloc` will allocate a new buffer of the requested size. However, the code does not check
