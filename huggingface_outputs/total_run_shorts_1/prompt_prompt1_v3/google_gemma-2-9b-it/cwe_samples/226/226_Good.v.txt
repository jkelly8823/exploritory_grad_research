VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability.  The `p_c` array is being cleared to 0 in multiple instances. While this might seem harmless, if the size of the `p_c` array is not explicitly defined or if it'
