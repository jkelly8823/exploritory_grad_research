VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` is vulnerable to ReDoS.  A malicious user could craft a long string containing many repeated characters, causing the regex to take an extremely long time to evaluate. This could lead to a denial of service attack, as the application becomes unresponsive.
