VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code does not handle potential integer overflow when dividing two large numbers. If the result of the division is too large to be represented as a double, it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a larger data type, such as long double or a custom type, to accommodate potentially larger results.
