VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Division Truncation
EXPLANATION:
The code performs integer division (totalTime / numRequests). Integer division truncates the decimal portion of the result, which can lead to an inaccurate average response time if the total time is not perfectly divisible by the number of requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use floating-point division (totalTime / (float)numRequests) to preserve
