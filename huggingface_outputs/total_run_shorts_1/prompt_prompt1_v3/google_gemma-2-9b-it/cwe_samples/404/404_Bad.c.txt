VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `fgets(buf, BUF_SZ, f)` function reads data from the file into the `buf` buffer. However, there is no check on the length of the input data being read. If the input data exceeds `BUF_SZ`, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to security vulnerabilities.
