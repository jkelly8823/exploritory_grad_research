VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of `os.urandom` for seeding a PRNG is insufficient for cryptographic security.
EXPLANATION: While `os.urandom` provides cryptographically secure random bytes, seeding a PRNG with only 2 bytes is insufficient for cryptographic security.  A PRNG seeded with a small amount of entropy can be predictable and vulnerable to attacks.
