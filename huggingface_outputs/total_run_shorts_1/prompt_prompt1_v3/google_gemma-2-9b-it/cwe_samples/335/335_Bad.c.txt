VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Use of a predictable seed for the random number generator.
EXPLANATION:  The code uses `srand(time())` to seed the random number generator. While `time()` provides a seemingly random value, it is not cryptographically secure and can be predictable, especially if the same code is executed multiple times in close succession. This can lead to predictable random numbers
