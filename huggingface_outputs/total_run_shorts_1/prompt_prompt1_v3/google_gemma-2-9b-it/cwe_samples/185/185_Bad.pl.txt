VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `system("lookup-phone $phone");` to execute a command with the user-supplied `$phone` variable directly embedded. This is a classic command injection vulnerability. An attacker could provide a malicious phone number that, when interpreted by the `lookup-phone` command, would execute arbitrary system commands.
