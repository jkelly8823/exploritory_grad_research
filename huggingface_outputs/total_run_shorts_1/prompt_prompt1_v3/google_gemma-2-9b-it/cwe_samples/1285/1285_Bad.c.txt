VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `gen_recv` function reads data from a socket into the `buf` buffer, which has a fixed size of `BUFFER_SIZE`. However, the code does not validate the length of the received data before copying it into `buf`. If the received data
