VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the line `array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];`. This line performs an array access using an expression that involves `trusted_ptr`. If `trusted_ptr` is under the attacker's control and they can manipulate its value, they could potentially cause a buffer overflow.
