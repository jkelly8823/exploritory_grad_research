VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABILITY_LINES: 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Loop
EXPLANATION: 
The code within the constructor of the `StockSymbolBean` class creates an infinite loop. The `while(listening)` loop will continue to execute indefinitely because the `listening` variable is always set to `true` and never modified within the loop. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive and consuming excessive resources.
