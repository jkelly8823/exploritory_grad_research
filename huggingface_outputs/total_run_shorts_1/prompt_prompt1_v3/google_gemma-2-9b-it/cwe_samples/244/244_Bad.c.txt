VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `realloc` function is used to resize the `cleartext_buffer`. If `get_secret()` returns a value larger than the allocated size, `realloc` will attempt to allocate a new buffer of size 1024. However, if the new buffer is not
