VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  LineNumbers/None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly executes a system command using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make")`. This is highly vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the input to the `exec` function, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Avoid using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` whenever possible
