VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code iterates indefinitely due to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and performs addition (`count += i`) within the loop. As `i` increases, `count` will eventually exceed the maximum value an integer can hold, leading to an integer overflow. This can result in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
