VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code iterates indefinitely due to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and keeps adding `i` to `count`.  Since `i` is a `long`, it can potentially exceed the maximum value of an `int`, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can result in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
