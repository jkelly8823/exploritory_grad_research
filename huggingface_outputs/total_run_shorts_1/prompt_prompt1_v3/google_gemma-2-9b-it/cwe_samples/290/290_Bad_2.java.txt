VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for DNS Rebinding Attack
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly constructs a hostname from the client's IP address using `InetAddress.getByName(ip)`.  An attacker could potentially control the client's IP address and craft a malicious hostname that resolves to a different, malicious server. This could allow the attacker to bypass security measures or gain unauthorized access
