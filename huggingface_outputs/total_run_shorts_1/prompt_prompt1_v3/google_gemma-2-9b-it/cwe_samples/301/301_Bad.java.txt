VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: The code directly constructs a command string using user-supplied input ("some cmd to execute & the password"). This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the string, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other system compromises.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before constructing the command string.
- Use a parameterized query or command template to separate user data from the command structure.
-
