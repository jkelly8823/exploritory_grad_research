VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Recursion
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential for infinite recursion. The recursive call `do_something_recursive(flg);` is made within a loop that doesn't have a clear termination condition. If the value of `flg` never changes to 0, the function will call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
