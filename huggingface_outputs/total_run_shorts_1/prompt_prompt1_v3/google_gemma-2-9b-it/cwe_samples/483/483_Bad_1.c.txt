VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for unintended code execution due to lack of proper conditional branching.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability due to the placement of `Do_X();` and `Do_Y();` statements.  In the provided context, both functions will always execute if the `condition` evaluates to `true`, regardless of the intended logic.
