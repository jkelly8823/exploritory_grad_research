VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `gets()` function is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows. It reads input from the user without any bounds checking, meaning that if the user provides input longer than the size of the `buf` array (64 bytes), it will overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or even arbitrary code execution
