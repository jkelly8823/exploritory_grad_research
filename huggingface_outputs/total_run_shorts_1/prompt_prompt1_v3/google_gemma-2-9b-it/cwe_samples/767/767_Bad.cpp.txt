VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. While the data type is declared as `float`, the assignment operation (`price = newPrice;`) could lead to an overflow if `newPrice` exceeds the maximum representable value for a float. This can result in unexpected behavior or even crashes.
