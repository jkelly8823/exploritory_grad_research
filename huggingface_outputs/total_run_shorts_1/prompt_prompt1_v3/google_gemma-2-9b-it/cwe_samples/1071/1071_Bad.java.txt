VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer division by zero
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to divide the variable 'a' by the variable 'b', which is initialized to 0. This will result in an ArithmeticException. However, the catch block does not handle the exception, effectively ignoring the error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* Check the value of 'b' before performing the division.
