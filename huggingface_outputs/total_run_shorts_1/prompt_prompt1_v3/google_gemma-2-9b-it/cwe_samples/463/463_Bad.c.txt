VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates a buffer of size 10 characters using `calloc`. However, the loop iterates 10 times, writing 'a' to each character of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer size is not sufficient to hold the data being written. In this case, the buffer is exactly
