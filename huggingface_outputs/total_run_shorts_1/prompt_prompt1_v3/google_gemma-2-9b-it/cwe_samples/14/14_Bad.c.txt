VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the `GetPasswordFromUser` function call. If this function does not properly validate the length of the input password, an attacker could provide a password longer than the `pwd` buffer's size (64 characters). This would lead to a buffer overflow, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and allowing for code execution.
