VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code adds two inputs (`input1` and `input2`) together to calculate `step`. If `input1` and `input2` are large enough, their sum could exceed the maximum value an integer can hold, leading to an integer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a data type that can handle larger
