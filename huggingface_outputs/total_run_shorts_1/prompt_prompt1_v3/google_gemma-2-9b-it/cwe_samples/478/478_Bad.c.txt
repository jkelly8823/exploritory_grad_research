VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unnecessary exit() call in case of failure.
EXPLANATION: The code exits the program immediately upon a security check failure. This prevents any further actions or logging that could be crucial for debugging or incident response.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Remove the `exit(-1)` call.
2. Log the security check failure with relevant details.
