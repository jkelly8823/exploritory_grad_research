VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code performs an addition operation (`input1 + input2`) and stores the result in the `step` variable. If `input1` and `input2` are large enough, their sum could exceed the maximum value that the `step` variable can hold, leading to an integer overflow. Integer overflow can result in unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or security vulnerabilities.
