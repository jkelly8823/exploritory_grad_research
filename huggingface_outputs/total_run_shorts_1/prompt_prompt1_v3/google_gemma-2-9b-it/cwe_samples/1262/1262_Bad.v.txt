VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Input Validation
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for access to certain CSRs (Control and Status Registers) based on privilege levels and debug mode. However, it lacks proper input validation for `csr_addr_i[11:4]`. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the value of
