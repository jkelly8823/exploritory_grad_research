VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to calculate the maximum value for an integer and a short integer. However, the calculation for `intPrimitive` involves bitwise operations that can lead to integer overflow.  The expression `(int)(~((int)0) ^ (1 << (sizeof(int)*8-1)))`  is designed to
