VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Use of Weak Encryption Algorithm
EXPLANATION: The code uses the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for encryption. DES is a very old and outdated algorithm that is known to be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  Use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of DES.
