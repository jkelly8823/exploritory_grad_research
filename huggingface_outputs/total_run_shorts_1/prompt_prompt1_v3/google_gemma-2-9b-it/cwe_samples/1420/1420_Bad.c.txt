VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `x` is less than `array1_size`. If it is, it calculates an index for `array2` using `array1[x] * 4096` and assigns the value at that index to `y`. 

The vulnerability arises because `array
