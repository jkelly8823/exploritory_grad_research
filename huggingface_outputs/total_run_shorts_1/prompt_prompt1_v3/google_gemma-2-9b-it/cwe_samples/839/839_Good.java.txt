VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not explicitly check for integer overflow when calculating the withdrawal amount. If a user attempts to withdraw a very large amount, it could potentially exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold, leading to an overflow and unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement checks to ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the maximum value
