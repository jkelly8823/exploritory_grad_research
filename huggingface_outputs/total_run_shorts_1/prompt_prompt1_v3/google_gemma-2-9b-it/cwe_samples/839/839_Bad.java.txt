VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code does not explicitly check for potential integer overflow when calculating the `newBalance`. If `accountBalance` is a large number and `withdrawAmount` is also large, the subtraction could result in an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a data type that can handle larger values, such as
