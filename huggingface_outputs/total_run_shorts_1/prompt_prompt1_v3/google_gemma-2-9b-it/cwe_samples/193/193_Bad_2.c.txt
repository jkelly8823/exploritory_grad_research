VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `filename` array is declared with a fixed size of `PATH_SIZE` (60 characters). However, the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i <= PATH_SIZE`, meaning it attempts to write characters beyond the allocated memory for `filename`. This
