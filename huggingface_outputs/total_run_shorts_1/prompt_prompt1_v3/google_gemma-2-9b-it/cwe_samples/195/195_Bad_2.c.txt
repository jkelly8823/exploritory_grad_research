VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader));` allocates memory based on the value of `numHeaders`. If `numHeaders` is larger than the available memory, this can lead to a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can hold.
