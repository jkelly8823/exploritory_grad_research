VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy(buf, strm, len);` line is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `buf` array has a fixed size of 512 bytes, but the `len` variable, which determines the number of bytes to copy, is not validated against the buffer size. If `len` is greater than
