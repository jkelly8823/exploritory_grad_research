VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not explicitly handle the potential for integer overflow when calculating the `amount` variable. If the `result` variable holds a large enough value, it could potentially cause an overflow when added to `amount`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a data type with a larger range,
