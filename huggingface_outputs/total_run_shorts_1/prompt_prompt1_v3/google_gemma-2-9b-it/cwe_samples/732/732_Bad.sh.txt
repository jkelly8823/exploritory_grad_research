VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory traversal vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `chmod -R ugo+r DIRNAME` command could be vulnerable to directory traversal if `DIRNAME` is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input for `DIRNAME` that includes `..` (parent directory) sequences, allowing them to access and modify files outside the intended directory.
