VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Predictable Random Number Generation
EXPLANATION: 
Using `System.currentTimeMillis()` as a seed for the random number generator can lead to predictable sequences of random numbers. If an attacker knows the time at which the code was executed, they can potentially predict the generated `accountID`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPR
