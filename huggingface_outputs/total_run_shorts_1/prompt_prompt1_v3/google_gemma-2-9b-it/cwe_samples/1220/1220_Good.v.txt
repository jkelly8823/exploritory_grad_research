VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8,9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates through two nested loops, potentially accessing and modifying elements in the `connectivity_map_o` array. Without knowing the exact sizes of `NB_SUBORDINATE` and `NB_MANAGER`, it's impossible to definitively say if a buffer overflow will occur. However, if these
