VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11,12,13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability within the `for` loop. The loop iterates from `j=0` to `j < 6`, incrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration.  While this appears harmless, the loop condition `j
