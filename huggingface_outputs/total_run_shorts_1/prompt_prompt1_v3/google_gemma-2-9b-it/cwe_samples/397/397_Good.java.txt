VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for unchecked exceptions
EXPLANATION: The method signature declares `throws IOException, InvocationTargetException, SQLException`. This means the method can potentially throw these exceptions, but it doesn't handle them.  Unhandled exceptions can lead to abrupt program termination and unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Handle exceptions:** Implement `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential `IOException`, `InvocationTargetException`, and `SQLException`
