VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Error Handling
EXPLANATION:  The code catches `IOException` but sends a generic `SC_NOT_FOUND` (404) error response. This doesn't provide specific information about the underlying issue (e.g., file not found, network error).  A more informative error response would be helpful for debugging and understanding the problem.
