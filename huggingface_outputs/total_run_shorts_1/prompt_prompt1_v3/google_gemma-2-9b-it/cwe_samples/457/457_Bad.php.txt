VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user-supplied input from `$_POST['names']` without any sanitization or validation. This means an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `$nameArray` variable, which would then be echoed back to the user.
