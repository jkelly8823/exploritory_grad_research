VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The `LoginUser()` function is not shown, but if it constructs a SQL query using user input without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker could manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL code, potentially compromising the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize all user input before using it in SQL queries
