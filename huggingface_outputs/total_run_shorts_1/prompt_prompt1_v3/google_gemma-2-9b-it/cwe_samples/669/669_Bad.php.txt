VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8,9,10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper sanitization. The `$username` and `$password` variables are concatenated directly into the query string, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query and potentially execute arbitrary SQL code.
