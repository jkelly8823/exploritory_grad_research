VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The database credentials (username and password) are stored directly in the code. This is a major security risk as anyone with access to the code can easily see the credentials.

- Store database credentials in an environment variable.
- Use a configuration file to store sensitive information.
- Implement a secrets management system.
