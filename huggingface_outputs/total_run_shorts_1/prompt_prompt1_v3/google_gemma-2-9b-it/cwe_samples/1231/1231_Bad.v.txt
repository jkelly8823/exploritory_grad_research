VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a for loop with the increment expression `j=j+1`. While this appears harmless, there's a potential for integer overflow if the value of `j` reaches the maximum representable value for the data type used.  When `j` reaches its maximum, adding 1 will cause
