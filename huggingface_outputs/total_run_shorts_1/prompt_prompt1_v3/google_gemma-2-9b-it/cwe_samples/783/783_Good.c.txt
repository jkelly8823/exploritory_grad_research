VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Direct comparison with a string literal.
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly compares the result of the `AuthenticateUser` function with the string literal `FAIL`. This is problematic because it assumes that the function always returns a string. If the function returns a different data type, such as an integer or boolean, the comparison will be incorrect and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
