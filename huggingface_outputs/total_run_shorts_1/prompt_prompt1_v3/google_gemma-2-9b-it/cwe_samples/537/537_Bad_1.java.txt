VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses user-supplied input (`username` and `password`) in the `authenticateUser` method without any sanitization or validation. This opens the door to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input that modifies the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data, modify records, or even execute arbitrary code on the database server.
