VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Bitwise AND operation used instead of OR
EXPLANATION: The code intends to check if a user has both read and write access. This should be done using a bitwise OR operation (`|`) to combine the read and write bits. However, it is currently using a bitwise AND operation (`&`), which will only return true if both bits are set.
