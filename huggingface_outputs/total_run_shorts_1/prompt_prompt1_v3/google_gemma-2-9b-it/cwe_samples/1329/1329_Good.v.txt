VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  HMAC Key Update Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability where the HMAC key is updated based on an external input (`hmac_key_i`) controlled by the `hmac_patch_en` signal. This allows an attacker to potentially modify the HMAC key in real-time, leading to a compromise of message integrity.
