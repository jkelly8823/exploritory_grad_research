VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly concatenates user input (`usernme` and `ccn`) into the log message without any sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input that alters the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries
