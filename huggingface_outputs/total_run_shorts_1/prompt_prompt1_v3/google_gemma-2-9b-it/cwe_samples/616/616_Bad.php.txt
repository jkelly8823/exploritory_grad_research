VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Variable Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential for variable injection. The variable `$varname` is directly used in the file name construction without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate the value of `$varname` to include malicious code or commands, leading to unintended file creation or execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize
