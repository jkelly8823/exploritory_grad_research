VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: The code directly inserts the value of `$_GET['username']` into an SQL query without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data from the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
