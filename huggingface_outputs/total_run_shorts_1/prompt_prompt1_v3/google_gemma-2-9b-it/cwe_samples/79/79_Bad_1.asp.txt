VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code concatenates user input (`eid`) directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This involves separating the SQL code from the user input and using placeholders
