VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the `$query` variable to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data, modify data, or even take control of the database server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This involves
