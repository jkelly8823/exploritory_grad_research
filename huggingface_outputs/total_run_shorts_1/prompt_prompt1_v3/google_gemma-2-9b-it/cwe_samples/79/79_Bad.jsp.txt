VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION: The code directly uses user input from the request parameter "eid" without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "eid" parameter, which will then be displayed on the page, potentially allowing them to steal user data, hijack sessions, or deface the website.
