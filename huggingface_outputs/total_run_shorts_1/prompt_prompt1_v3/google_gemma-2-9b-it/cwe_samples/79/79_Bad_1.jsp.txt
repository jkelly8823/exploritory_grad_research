VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly inserts the user-supplied `eid` variable into the SQL query without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or even complete system compromise.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries to separate the data from the SQL command.
