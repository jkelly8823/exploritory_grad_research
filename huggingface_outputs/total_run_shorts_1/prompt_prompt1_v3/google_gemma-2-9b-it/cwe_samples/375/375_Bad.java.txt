VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code declares a `patientList` array with a fixed size of 50. If a method attempts to add more than 50 patients to the list, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space of an array, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing
