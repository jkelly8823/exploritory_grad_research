VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `strcpy(cp_buf, buf)` function does not perform bounds checking. If the input read by `fgets(buf, 10, stdin)` exceeds 9 characters (remembering the null terminator), it will write past the end of the `cp_buf` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
