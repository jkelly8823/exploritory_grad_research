VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user input from `request.getParameter(ITEM_NAME)` in a string comparison without any sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input that alters the intended comparison, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input using appropriate methods
