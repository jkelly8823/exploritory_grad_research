VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Resource Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code opens a `FileInputStream` but does not properly handle the resource. While `fis.close()` is called, it's not guaranteed to be executed if an exception occurs within the `processPFile` method. This can lead to a resource leak where the file stream remains open, consuming system resources.
