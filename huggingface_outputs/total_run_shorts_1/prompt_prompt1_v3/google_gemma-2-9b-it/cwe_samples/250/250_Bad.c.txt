VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `chdir("/")` call after `chroot(APP_HOME)` can lead to a directory traversal vulnerability.  Even though `chroot` restricts the process to the `APP_HOME` directory, `chdir("/")` changes the current working directory to the root directory (`/`), effectively bypassing the `chroot` restriction
