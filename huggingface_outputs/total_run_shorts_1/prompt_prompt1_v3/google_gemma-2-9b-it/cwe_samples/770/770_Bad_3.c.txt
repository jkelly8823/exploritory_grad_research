VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. The `connection()` function allocates memory using `malloc(1024)` but doesn't explicitly check if the allocation was successful. If `malloc()` fails, it returns `NULL`, and the code will continue, leading to a
