VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Loop
EXPLANATION: The code contains an infinite loop due to the `while (1)` statement. This means the program will continuously accept connections without any exit condition, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Add a condition to the `while` loop to break the loop under specific circumstances, such as receiving a certain signal or closing the socket.
