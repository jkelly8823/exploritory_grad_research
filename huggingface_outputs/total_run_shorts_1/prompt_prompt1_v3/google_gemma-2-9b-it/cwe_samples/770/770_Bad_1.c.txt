VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `writeToFile` function.  Without knowing the implementation of `writeToFile`, we can assume it writes the contents of the `buffer` to a file. If the `buffer` is larger than the allocated space in the file, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
