VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code uses a string interpolation with the variable "{StorageAccountName}" without proper sanitization. This could lead to an attacker injecting malicious code or data into the string, potentially compromising the storage account.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Sanitize the input for "{StorageAccountName}" before using it in the string interpolation.
- Use parameterized queries
