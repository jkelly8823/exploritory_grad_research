VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `gets()` function is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows. It does not take into account the size of the buffer and will write data beyond its allocated memory if the input is longer than `BUFSIZE`. This can overwrite critical data structures or execute arbitrary code, leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace `gets()`
