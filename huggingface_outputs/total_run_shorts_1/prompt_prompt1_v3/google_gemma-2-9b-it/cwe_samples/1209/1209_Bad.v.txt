VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `gpio_out` is declared as an integer, and it is assigned a value of 1. However, the context suggests that `gpio_out` might be used to control a GPIO pin, which typically has a limited range of values (e.g
