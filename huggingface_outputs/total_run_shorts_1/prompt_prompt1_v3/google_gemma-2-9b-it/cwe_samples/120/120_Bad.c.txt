VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reads user input into a fixed-size character array (`last_name`) without checking the length of the input. If the user enters more than 19 characters, it will overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a crash or security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a bounded input function
