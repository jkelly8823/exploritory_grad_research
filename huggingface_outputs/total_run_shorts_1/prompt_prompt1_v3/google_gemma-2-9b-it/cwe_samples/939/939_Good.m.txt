VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: URL Injection
EXPLANATION: The code directly constructs a URL string using user-supplied data (`stringURL`). This makes the application vulnerable to URL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `stringURL` parameter to redirect the application to malicious URLs or execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before constructing the URL.
- Use a URL encoding library
