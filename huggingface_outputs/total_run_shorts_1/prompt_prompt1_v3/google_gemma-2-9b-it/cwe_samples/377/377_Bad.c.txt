VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `fwrite` function writes data from the `recvbuf` buffer to the `tmp` file without checking the size of the data being received. If the `recv` function receives more data than the buffer can hold, it will overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to a buffer overflow
