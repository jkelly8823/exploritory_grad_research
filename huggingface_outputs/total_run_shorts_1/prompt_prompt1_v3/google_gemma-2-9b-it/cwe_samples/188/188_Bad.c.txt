VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to write a null terminator (`0`) to the memory location pointed to by `(&a + 1)`.  However, `a` is a single character, so `(&a + 1)` points to memory beyond the allocated space for `a`. This can lead to a buffer overflow, overwriting adjacent memory
