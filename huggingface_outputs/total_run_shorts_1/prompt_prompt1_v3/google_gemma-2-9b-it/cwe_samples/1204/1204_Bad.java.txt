VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Initialization of Key Generator
EXPLANATION: 
The code initializes a DES key generator with a key size of 56 bits using `kg.init(56)`. However, DES is a deprecated and insecure algorithm with a known key size of 56 bits. Using DES is highly discouraged due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks.
