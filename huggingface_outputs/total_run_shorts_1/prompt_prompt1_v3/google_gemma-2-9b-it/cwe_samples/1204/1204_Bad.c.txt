VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Initialization of Encryption Context
EXPLANATION: 
The code initializes an encryption context using `EVP_EncryptInit`. However, it fails to properly initialize the encryption key and initialization vector (IV). The key is generated using `RAND_bytes`, which is a good practice, but the IV is simply set to all zeros using `memset`. This is a major
