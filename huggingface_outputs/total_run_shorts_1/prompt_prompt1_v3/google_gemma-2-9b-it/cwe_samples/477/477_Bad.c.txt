VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers/None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the `strtok` function to parse the `pwdline` string.  Without proper bounds checking, `strtok` could potentially read beyond the allocated memory of `pwdline`, leading to a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer
