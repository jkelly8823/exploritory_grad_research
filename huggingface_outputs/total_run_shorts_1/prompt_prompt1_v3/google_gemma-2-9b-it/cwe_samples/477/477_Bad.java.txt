VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly constructs a command by concatenating user-supplied input from the environment variable "cmd" without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safe command execution library that handles escaping and sanitization automatically.
- Validate and sanitize user input before using it
