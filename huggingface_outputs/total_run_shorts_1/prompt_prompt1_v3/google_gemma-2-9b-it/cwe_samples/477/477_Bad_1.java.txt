VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses a constructor for the String class that takes a byte array and an offset. Without knowing the size of the `nameBytes` array, there is a risk of a buffer overflow if `highByte` is not carefully calculated. If `highByte` is larger than the length of `nameBytes`, it could
