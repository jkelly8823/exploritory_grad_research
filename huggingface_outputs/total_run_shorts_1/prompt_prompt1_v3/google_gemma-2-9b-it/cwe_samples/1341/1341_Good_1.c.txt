VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Close File
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to close the file twice. This is a potential issue as it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. While the second close attempt might not always cause problems, it's generally considered bad practice and can lead to resource leaks or inconsistencies.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the second `fclose(f)` call on line
