VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cache Timing Attack
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential cache timing attack. Lines 4 and 7 are particularly concerning. Line 4 attempts to read kernel memory, and the `jz retry` instruction indicates that the process is repeated until a non-zero value is found. This repeated access to specific kernel memory locations can leak information about the contents
