VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: NullPointerException
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to access the `getName()` method of the `user` object without ensuring that `user` is not null. If `user` is not initialized before calling `someMethod()`, this will result in a NullPointerException.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Check if `user` is null before calling `user.getName()
