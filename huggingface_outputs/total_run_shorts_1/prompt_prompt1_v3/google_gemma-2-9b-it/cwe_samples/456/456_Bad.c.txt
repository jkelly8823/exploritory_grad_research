VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `sscanf` to parse integers from the `untrusted_input` string. However, there are no bounds checks on the input size. This means that an attacker could provide a maliciously crafted input string that is longer than the allocated space for `m` and `n`, leading to a buffer overflow.
