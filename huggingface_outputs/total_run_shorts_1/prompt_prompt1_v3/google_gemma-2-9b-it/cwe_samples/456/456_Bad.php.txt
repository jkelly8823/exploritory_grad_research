VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: The `authenticate($username,$password)` function is vulnerable to SQL injection. If the function does not properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the `$username` or `$password` parameters. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, or modify the database.
