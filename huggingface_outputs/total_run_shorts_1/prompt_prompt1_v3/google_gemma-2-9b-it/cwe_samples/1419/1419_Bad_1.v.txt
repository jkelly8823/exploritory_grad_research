VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Out-of-Bounds Memory Access
EXPLANATION:
The code iterates through an array `acct_mem` using a for loop with the index `j`. The loop condition `j < AcCt_MEM_SIZE` checks if `j` is less than the size of the array. However, the loop increment `j=j+1`
