VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet displays a warning indicating a connection attempt to a MySQL database using the `mysql_pconnect()` function. The warning message reveals the username ('root@localhost') and the fact that a password is being used ('N1nj4').  This practice of directly embedding credentials within the code is highly insecure.
