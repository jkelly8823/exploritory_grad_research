VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Infinite Loop Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code contains an infinite loop due to the `while(true)` statement. This loop will continue to execute indefinitely, consuming resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace the `while(true)` statement with a conditional statement that terminates the loop under specific conditions
