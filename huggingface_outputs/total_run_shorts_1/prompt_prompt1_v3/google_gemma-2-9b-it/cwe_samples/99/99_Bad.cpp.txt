VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet reads input from a file stream (`ifs`) and stores it directly into a string `s` without any size check. This creates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. If the input file contains more data than the string `s` can hold, the excess data will overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to program crashes or malicious
