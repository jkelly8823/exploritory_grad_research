VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `fgets(filename, sizeof(filename), network);` line is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.  `fgets` reads data from `network` into `filename` until a newline character is encountered or the buffer is full. If the data from `network` is longer than `sizeof(filename)`, it will overwrite adjacent memory
