VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code snippet directly embeds the database username ("scott") and password ("tiger") within the connection string. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive information directly in the source code, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a secure method for storing and retrieving credentials, such as using environment variables
