VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 7, 10, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not explicitly check the length of the `output` string before writing it to the file. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the `output` string is longer than the allocated buffer in the `writeToFile` function. Similarly, the
