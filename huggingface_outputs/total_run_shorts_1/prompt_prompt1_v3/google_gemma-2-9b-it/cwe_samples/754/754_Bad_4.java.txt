VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Null Pointer Exception
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to read from a `FileReader` object (`reader`) that is initialized with the `readFile` object. However, `readFile` is initialized as `null` and never assigned a valid file object. This will result in a `NullPointerException` when `new FileReader(readFile)` is executed.
