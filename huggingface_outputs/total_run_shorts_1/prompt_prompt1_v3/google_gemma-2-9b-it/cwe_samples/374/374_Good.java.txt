VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a shallow copy vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code creates a copy of the `Book` object using `book.clone()`. However, if the `Book` class contains mutable objects (e.g., lists, maps) as fields, cloning might only create a shallow copy. This means that changes to the mutable objects within the `bookSold` copy will also affect the original `book`
