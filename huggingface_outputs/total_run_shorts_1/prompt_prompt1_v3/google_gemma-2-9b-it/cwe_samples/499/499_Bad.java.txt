VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5,6,7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive data exposure

The constructor `Patient` directly assigns these values to the instance variables without any validation or sanitization. This leaves the data vulnerable to exposure if the object is accessed or manipulated improperly.
