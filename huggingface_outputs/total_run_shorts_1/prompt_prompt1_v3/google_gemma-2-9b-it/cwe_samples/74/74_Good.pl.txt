VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` is vulnerable to ReDoS.  The `\w` character class can match a wide range of Unicode characters, including those that are computationally expensive to process. An attacker could craft a malicious input string containing a large number of these expensive characters, causing the regular expression to take an excessive amount of time
