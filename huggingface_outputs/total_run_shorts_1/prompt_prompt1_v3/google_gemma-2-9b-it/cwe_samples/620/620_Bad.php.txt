VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses user input from the $_GET array to construct a SQL query without any sanitization or validation. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data from the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input
