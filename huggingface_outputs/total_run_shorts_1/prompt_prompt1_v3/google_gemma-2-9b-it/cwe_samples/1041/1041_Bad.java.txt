VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code calculates `surface_area` using `Math.pow(r, 2)`. If `r` is a large integer, `Math.pow(r, 2)` could result in a value that exceeds the maximum value representable by a `double`. This can lead to integer overflow
