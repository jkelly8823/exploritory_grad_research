VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for redundant calculations and unnecessary resource consumption.
EXPLANATION: 
The code calculates the `surface_area` twice within the `main` method, both under the condition that `r` is greater than a specific threshold. This redundancy can lead to unnecessary computations and potential performance issues, especially if the `ComplexMath` function is computationally expensive
