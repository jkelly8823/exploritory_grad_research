VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. While `free(ptr)` is used to deallocate the memory allocated for `ptr`, it's unclear if `ptr` is always properly initialized and if the `new BarObj()` call is successful. If `new BarObj()` fails, `ptr` might remain a null pointer
