VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Code Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `System.loadLibrary("awt")` within a privileged context. This could be vulnerable to code injection if the "awt" library is not carefully controlled. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious library with the same name, which would then be loaded and executed with elevated privileges.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
