The code snippet exhibits a classic double-checked locking pattern vulnerability. While the intent is to ensure thread safety when initializing the `helper` object, the pattern can lead to performance issues and potential race conditions.

Here's why:

1. **Redundant Check:** The `if (helper == null)` check is performed both
