VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak. If the `err` condition is false, the `ptr` pointer will be allocated memory, but if `abrt` is set to 1, the `ptr` pointer will not be freed. This can lead to a memory leak over time as more allocations occur without corresponding deallocations
