VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory dynamically using `new int[2]` if the `heap` variable is true. However, it doesn't have a corresponding `delete` statement to free the allocated memory when it's no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, where the allocated memory is not released back to the system
