VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `param('name')` function to retrieve a user-supplied value and directly incorporates it into a system command (`$nslookup $name`). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system, potentially leading to malicious actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in system commands.
