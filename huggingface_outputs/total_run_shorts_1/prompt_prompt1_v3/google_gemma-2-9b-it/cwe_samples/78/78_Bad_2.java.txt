VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: The code directly constructs a command string by concatenating user input (`btype`) with hardcoded system commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the command string, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other system compromises.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input (`btype`) before using it in the command string.
- Use a safer method for executing commands, such as
