VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the `memcpy` function is used to copy data from `hp->h_addr` to `server.sin_addr`. The size of the data being copied is determined by `hp->h_length`, which is not
