VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
Shifting an unsigned integer left by a negative amount can lead to an integer overflow. In this case, `1 << -5` attempts to shift the binary representation of 1 five positions to the left.  Since the shift amount is negative, it effectively shifts the bits five positions to the right, which is equivalent to dividing by
