VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `choose_bit` function subtracts `bit_number_from_elsewhere` from `reg_bit`. If `bit_number_from_elsewhere` is larger than `reg_bit`, this will result in an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
