VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABILITY_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Trust based on class comparison
EXPLANATION: The code trusts an object (`inputClass`) based solely on its class type (`inputClass.getClass() == TrustedClass.class`). This is a vulnerability because an attacker could potentially create a malicious class that inherits from `TrustedClass` and bypass security checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Avoid relying solely on class comparisons for
