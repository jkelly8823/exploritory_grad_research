VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly constructs a command string using user-supplied input from `System.getProperty("cmd")`.  Without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands into this string, which would then be executed by the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize user input:**  Never directly use user input in command construction.
