VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Logic Error
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to have a logic error in the assignment statement. It assigns `rom_rdata` to `rom_rdata_linux` regardless of the value of `ariane_boot_sel_i`. This means that the output `rom_rdata` will always be the same as `rom_rdata_linux
