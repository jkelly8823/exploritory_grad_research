VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not explicitly show SQL queries being constructed. However, the presence of variables like `name` and `email` suggests that user input might be used in constructing SQL queries later in the application. If these variables are directly concatenated into SQL statements without proper sanitization, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
