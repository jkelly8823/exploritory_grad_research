VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Sensitive Data Exposure
EXPLANATION: The code snippet reveals the declaration of private variables (`name` and `email`) intended to store user registration information. However, the code lacks proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms.  Without these safeguards, an attacker could potentially inject malicious data into these fields, leading to sensitive information exposure or other security breaches.
