VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code constructs a URL object using "file:subdir/". This is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because an attacker could potentially manipulate the "subdir/" part of the URL to access files outside the intended directory. For example, an attacker could provide "file:../../etc/passwd" to access the system's password file.
