VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `body = &message[1][0];` attempts to assign the address of the second element in the `message` array to the `body` pointer. However, the code does not validate the size of the `message` array or the length of the message body.
