VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the length of a message is within a valid range (0 to MAX_LENGTH). However, it lacks bounds checking on the `message` array itself. If `getMessageLength(message[0])` returns a value larger than the actual size of the `message` array, a buffer overflow vulnerability could occur
