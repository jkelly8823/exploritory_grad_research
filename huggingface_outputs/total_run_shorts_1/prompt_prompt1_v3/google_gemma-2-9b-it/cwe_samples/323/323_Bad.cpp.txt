VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper use of cryptographic functions and potential for nonce reuse.
EXPLANATION: 
The code demonstrates several security flaws:

1. **Weak Nonce Generation:** The nonce (`bad nonce`) is generated using a predictable string. A strong nonce should be cryptographically random.

2. **Nonce
