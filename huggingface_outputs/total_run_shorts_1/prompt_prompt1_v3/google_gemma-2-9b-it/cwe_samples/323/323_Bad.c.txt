VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of hardcoded nonce and potential buffer overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a hardcoded nonce ("bad") which is a major security flaw.  A hardcoded nonce can be easily discovered by attackers, rendering the encryption scheme ineffective. Additionally, there's a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the calculation
