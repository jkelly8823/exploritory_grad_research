VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code lacks bounds checking for the `$transfer_amount` variable. If a user attempts to transfer a very large amount, it could potentially lead to an integer overflow. This means the result of the subtraction (`$balance - $transfer_amount`) could wrap around to a negative value, potentially causing unexpected behavior or allowing for unauthorized access
