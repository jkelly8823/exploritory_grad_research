VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4, 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `strncpy` to copy data from command-line arguments (`argv[2]` and `argv[3]`) into the `Filename` and `Pattern` buffers respectively. While it attempts to mitigate buffer overflow by specifying a maximum copy length using `sizeof(Filename)-1`
