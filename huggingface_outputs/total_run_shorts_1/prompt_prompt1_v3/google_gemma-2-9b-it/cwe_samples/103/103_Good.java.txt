VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not directly demonstrate SQL injection. However, the absence of input sanitization and validation for the 'name' field raises a concern. If the 'name' field were to be used in a database query without proper escaping or validation, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code.
