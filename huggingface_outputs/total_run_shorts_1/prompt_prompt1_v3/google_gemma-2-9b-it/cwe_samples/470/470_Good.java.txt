VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user input from the `request.getParameter("ctl")` without any sanitization or validation. This input is used to dynamically construct the command to be executed (`AddCommand` or `ModifyCommand`). If an attacker can manipulate the `ctl` parameter, they could potentially inject malicious SQL code into the command, leading to data breaches or other security vulnerabilities
