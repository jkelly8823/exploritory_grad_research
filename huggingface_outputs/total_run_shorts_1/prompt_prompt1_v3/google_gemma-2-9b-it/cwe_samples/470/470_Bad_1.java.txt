VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION: 
The code dynamically loads a class using `Class.forName(ctl + "Command")` based on user input from the `request.getParameter("ctl")` parameter. This is highly vulnerable to RCE attacks. An attacker could provide malicious input for the `ctl` parameter, leading to the execution of
