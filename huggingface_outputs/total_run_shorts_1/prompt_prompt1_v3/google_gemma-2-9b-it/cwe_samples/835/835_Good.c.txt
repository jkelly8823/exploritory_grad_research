VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:Infinite Loop Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential infinite loop vulnerability. The `while` loop condition `connected < 0 && count < MAX_ATTEMPTS` will continue to execute as long as the connection attempt fails (`connected < 0`) and the attempt count is below the maximum allowed (`count < MAX_ATTEMPTS`).
