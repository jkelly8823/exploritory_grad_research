VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of single equals sign for comparison
EXPLANATION:
The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {` uses a single equals sign (`=`), which is an assignment operator, not a comparison operator. This will assign the result of `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` to the variable `cert` instead
