VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds array access
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `GetUntrustedOffset()` to determine the index for accessing an element in the `items` array. If `GetUntrustedOffset()` returns a value that is less than 1 or greater than the size of the array (4), it will result in an out-of-bounds array access
