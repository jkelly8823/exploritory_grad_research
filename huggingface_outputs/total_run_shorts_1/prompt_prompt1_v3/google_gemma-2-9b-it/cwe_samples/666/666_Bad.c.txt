VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Free
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a double free vulnerability.  The line `free(ptr);` is executed unconditionally at the end of the code block. However, there is also a conditional `free(ptr);` within the `if (abrt)` block. This means that under certain conditions, `ptr` will be freed twice,
