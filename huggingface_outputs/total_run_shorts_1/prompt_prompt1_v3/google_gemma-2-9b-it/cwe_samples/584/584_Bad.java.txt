VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Resource Leak
EXPLANATION:
The `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. This means that the resource `r` will always be returned, even if an exception occurs during the `try` block. If `r` represents a resource that needs to be closed or released, this could lead to a resource leak.
