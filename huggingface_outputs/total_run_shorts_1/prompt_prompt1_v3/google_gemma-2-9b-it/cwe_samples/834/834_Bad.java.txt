VULNERABLE_LINES: 11,12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the number of days until the inventory count reaches the minimum threshold. The `inventoryCount` is decremented by `rateSold` in each iteration of the `while` loop. If `rateSold` is large enough, `inventoryCount` could become negative, leading to an integer overflow.
