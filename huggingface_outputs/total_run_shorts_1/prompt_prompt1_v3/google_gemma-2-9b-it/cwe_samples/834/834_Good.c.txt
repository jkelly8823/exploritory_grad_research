VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Recursion
EXPLANATION:
The code has a potential for infinite recursion. The recursive call `do_something_recursive(flg);` is made within a conditional statement that only checks if `flg` is non-zero. If `flg` is not modified within the recursive function, the condition will always be true, leading to an infinite loop
