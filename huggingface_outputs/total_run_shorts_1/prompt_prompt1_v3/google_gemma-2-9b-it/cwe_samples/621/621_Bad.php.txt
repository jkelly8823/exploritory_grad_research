VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2,5,6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user input is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.  The `buildQuery` function is not shown, but it likely constructs a query that includes the `$user` and `$pass` variables. An attacker could manipulate these inputs
