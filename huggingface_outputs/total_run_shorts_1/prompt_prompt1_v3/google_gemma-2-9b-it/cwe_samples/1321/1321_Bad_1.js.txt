VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype Pollution
EXPLANATION:
The code utilizes `setValueByPath` to modify object prototypes.  Specifically, it attempts to set `isAdmin` properties on the `__proto__` of an empty object and on the `constructor.prototype` of an empty object. This can lead to prototype pollution, a vulnerability where attackers can inject malicious properties into object prototypes
