VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for race condition
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) within a synchronous always block triggered by both `clk` and `rst`. This can lead to a race condition if multiple processes try to modify the value of `q` simultaneously.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use blocking assignments (`=`) instead of non-blocking
