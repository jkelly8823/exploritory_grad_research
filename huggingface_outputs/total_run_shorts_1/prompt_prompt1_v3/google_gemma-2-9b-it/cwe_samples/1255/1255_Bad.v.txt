VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a race condition.
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) within a synchronous always block triggered by both `clk` and `rst`. This can lead to a race condition if the `rst` signal changes state between the time the `clk` edge is sampled and the assignment to `q` is performed.
