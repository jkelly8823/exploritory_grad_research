VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Data Loss due to Type Casting
EXPLANATION: 
The code casts the float value `$floatVal` to an integer using `(int)$floatVal`. This truncation operation discards the decimal portion of the float, potentially leading to data loss.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- If preserving the decimal precision is crucial, consider using a data type that supports floating
