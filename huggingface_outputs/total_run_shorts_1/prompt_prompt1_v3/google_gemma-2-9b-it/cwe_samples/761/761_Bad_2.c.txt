VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates a fixed-size buffer (`input`) of 40 characters using `malloc`. However, it doesn't check the length of the user input received from `get_user_input`. If the user provides input longer than 40 characters, it will overflow the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and
