VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `recvfrom` function receives data from a client and stores it in the `msg` buffer. However, the size of the `msg` buffer is fixed (determined by `MAX_MSG`). If a client sends more data than `MAX_MSG` allows, the excess
