VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `read()` function reads data from the file descriptor `fd` into the buffer `buf`, which has a fixed size of `BLOCK_SIZE`. If the data read from the file exceeds `BLOCK_SIZE`, it will overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow
