VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Using ECB mode for RSA encryption is highly insecure.
EXPLANATION:  The code uses the ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode for RSA encryption. ECB mode is known to be extremely vulnerable to attacks, as it encrypts each block of data independently without considering the context of previous blocks. This makes it
