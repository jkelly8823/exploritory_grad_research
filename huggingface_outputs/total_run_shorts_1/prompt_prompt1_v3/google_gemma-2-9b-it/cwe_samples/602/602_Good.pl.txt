VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive information (username and password) is being sent in plain text over the network.
EXPLANATION: The code directly sends the username and password in the "AUTH" command without any encryption or hashing. This makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, as an attacker could easily intercept and capture this sensitive data.
