VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet does not directly demonstrate SQL injection. However, the `getCustomerId()` method and the setter `setCustomerId(String id)` raise a concern. If these methods are used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the database. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
