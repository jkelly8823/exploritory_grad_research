VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal because the `$profilePath` variable is constructed by concatenating the `$dataPath` with the `$username` parameter without proper sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious `$username` value that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") to access files outside the intended
