VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allows an attacker to potentially traverse outside the intended "safe_dir" directory by providing a malicious input path.  The `startsWith("/safe_dir/")` check only verifies the beginning of the path, not the entire path. An attacker could craft a path like "/safe_dir/../../etc/passwd"
