VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal because the `$dir` variable is concatenated with the user-supplied `$lang` variable without proper sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious `$lang` value that includes directory traversal sequences, such as ".." or "../", to access files outside the intended directory.
