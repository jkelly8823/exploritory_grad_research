VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Bitwise XOR operation with potentially uninitialized data.
EXPLANATION:
The line `in_sr = ^ (poly_i [15:0] & entropy16 [15:0]);` performs a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) on the result of a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between `poly_i` and `entropy1
