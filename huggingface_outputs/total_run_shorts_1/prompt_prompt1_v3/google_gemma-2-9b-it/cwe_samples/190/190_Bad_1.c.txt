VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `xmalloc` function allocates memory for the `response` array based on the value of `nresp`. However, there is no check to ensure that `nresp` is within a safe range. If `nresp` is larger than the available memory, it can lead
