VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `num_imgs` number of `img_t` structures using `malloc`. However, `num_imgs` is obtained from an external function `get_num_imgs()`. If this function returns a value larger than the available memory or if an attacker can manipulate the return value, a buffer overflow
