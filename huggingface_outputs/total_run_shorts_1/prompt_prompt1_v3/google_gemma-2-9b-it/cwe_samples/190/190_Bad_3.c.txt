VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `short` variables to store sales figures (`JanSold`, `FebSold`, `MarSold`, and `quarterSold`).  Shorts have a limited range (typically -32,768 to 32,767). If sales figures exceed this range, an integer overflow will occur.
