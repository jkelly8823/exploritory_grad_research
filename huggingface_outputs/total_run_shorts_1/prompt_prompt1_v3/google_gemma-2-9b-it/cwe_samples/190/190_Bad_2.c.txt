VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `buf` array is declared with a fixed size (`SOMEBIGNUM`), but the `while` loop reads data from `getFromInput` without checking if the data will exceed the buffer's capacity.  

The `bytesRec` variable keeps track of the number of
