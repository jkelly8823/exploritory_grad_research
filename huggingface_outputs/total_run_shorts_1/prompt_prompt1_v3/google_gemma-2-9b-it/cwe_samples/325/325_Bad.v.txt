VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to `hmac` with the argument `bigData`. Without knowing the size of `bigData` or the expected input size of the `hmac` function, there's a risk of a buffer overflow. If `bigData` is larger than the buffer allocated for the `hmac
