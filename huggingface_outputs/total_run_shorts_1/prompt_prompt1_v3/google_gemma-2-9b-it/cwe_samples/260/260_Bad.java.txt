VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores sensitive information (username and password) as strings within the variables `webapp.ldap.username` and `webapp.ldap.password`. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes credentials directly in the code, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive information
