VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `GetUntrustedInt()` function is assumed to return an integer value from an untrusted source.  If this function returns a value larger than the maximum capacity of a `HashMap`, it can lead to a buffer overflow. When a `HashMap` is created with a size exceeding its
