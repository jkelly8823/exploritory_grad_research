VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `size` is obtained from an untrusted source (`GetUntrustedInt()`), meaning its value could be arbitrarily large. When `size` is multiplied by `sizeof(char)`, the result (`totBytes`) could exceed the maximum value an `unsigned int` can hold
