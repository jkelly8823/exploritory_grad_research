VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Arbitrary Code Execution
EXPLANATION:
The `handleConfigAction` function dynamically constructs and executes code based on user input (`param('action')` and `param('key')`). This opens the door to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate these parameters. An attacker could craft malicious input to execute arbitrary code on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize
