VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `processString` function. The vulnerability arises from the use of `strlen(str)` to determine the length of the input string `str`. If the input string is maliciously crafted to be longer than the allocated memory for `str`, it could lead to a buffer overflow.
