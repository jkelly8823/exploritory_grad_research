VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a path traversal vulnerability. The `getInputPath()` function is assumed to accept user input, which is directly used to construct the file path. If a malicious user provides input containing ".." (parent directory traversal), the resulting path could lead outside the intended "safe_dir" directory, potentially allowing access to sensitive
