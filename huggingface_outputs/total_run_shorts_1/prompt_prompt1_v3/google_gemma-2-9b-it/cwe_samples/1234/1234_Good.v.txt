VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8,9,10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates through a loop with a counter variable 'j'. The loop condition `j < 6` suggests a maximum value of 5 for 'j'. However, the increment operation `j=j+1` could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the
