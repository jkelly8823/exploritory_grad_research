VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly includes a file path constructed from user-supplied input (`$_GET['module_name']`). This allows an attacker to specify a malicious file to be included, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Sanitize and validate user input before using it to construct file paths.
