VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION: 
The `generateSessionId()` function is not shown, but if it doesn't properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the `sessionID` variable. This could lead to XSS attacks where the attacker's script is executed in the user's browser.
