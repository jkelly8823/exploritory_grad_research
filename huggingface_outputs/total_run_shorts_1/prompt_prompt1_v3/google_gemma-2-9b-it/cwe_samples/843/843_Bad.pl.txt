VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code uses a direct comparison of an array with a string, which is not the correct way to check for membership.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet attempts to determine if the user has the privilege "user" by comparing the entire `$UserPrivilegeArray` array to the string "user". This comparison will always evaluate to false because arrays and strings are not directly comparable in this manner.
