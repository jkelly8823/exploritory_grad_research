VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly inserts the value from the $_GET['value'] parameter into the query without any sanitization or validation. This opens the door for SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could craft malicious input to manipulate the database query and potentially execute unauthorized commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
