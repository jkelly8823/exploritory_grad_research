VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Use of MD5 for password hashing
EXPLANATION: MD5 is a weak hashing algorithm that is easily vulnerable to collision attacks. This means that attackers could potentially find two different passwords that hash to the same value, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Replace MD5 with a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or
