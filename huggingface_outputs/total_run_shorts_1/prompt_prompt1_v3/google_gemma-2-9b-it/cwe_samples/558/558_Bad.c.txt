VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for privilege escalation vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet checks if the current user belongs to a trusted group (`isTrustedGroup(pwd->pw_gid)`). If they do, it grants access (`allow()`). This could be vulnerable if the `isTrustedGroup` function is not properly implemented and allows unauthorized users to bypass the intended access control
