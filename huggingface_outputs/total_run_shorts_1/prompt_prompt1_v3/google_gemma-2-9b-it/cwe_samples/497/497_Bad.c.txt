VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the size of the destination buffer (`stderr`) is not checked against the length of the format string. If the `path` environment variable is longer than the buffer allocated for `stderr`, it can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
