VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using `malloc` but does not have a corresponding `free` call to release the memory when it is no longer needed. This will lead to a memory leak over time as the program continues to allocate memory without freeing it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a `free(foo)` statement before the end of the function
