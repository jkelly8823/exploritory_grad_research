VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded File Path
EXPLANATION: The code directly references a file path ("app/properties.config") within the source code. This makes the application vulnerable to path traversal attacks if user input is used to construct or modify the file path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Use environment variables or configuration files to store the file path, making it more flexible and secure.
