VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Error Handling
EXPLANATION: The code catches all exceptions (Throwable) and logs the error message. This can mask underlying issues and prevent proper debugging. It's best practice to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Catch specific exceptions like IOException instead of Throwable.
2. Handle each exception type differently based on its nature
