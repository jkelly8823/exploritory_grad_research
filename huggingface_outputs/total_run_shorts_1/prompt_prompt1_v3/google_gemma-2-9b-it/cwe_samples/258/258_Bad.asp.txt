VULNERABLE_LINES: 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code snippet stores database credentials (username and password) directly within the connection string. This is a major security vulnerability as these credentials are exposed in plain text, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Store database credentials securely using environment variables or a configuration file.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
