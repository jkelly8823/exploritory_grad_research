VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a hardcoded password vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code directly compares a user-provided password with a hardcoded value `compressed_password`. This is a major security risk as the hardcoded password is directly exposed in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
-  Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
-  Never store passwords
