VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a NullPointerException
EXPLANATION: 
While the code includes an assertion (`assert email != null;`), assertions are primarily for debugging and are not guaranteed to be executed in production environments. If `request.getParameter("email_address")` returns null, a NullPointerException could occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Handle the null case:** Use an if statement to check if `email` is null
