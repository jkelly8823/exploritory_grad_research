VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Session ID Length Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:  Setting a fixed session ID length to 8 bytes can be a security risk. Attackers may be able to exploit weaknesses in session ID generation or storage to guess or brute-force session IDs, especially with a predictable length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
-  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate session IDs
