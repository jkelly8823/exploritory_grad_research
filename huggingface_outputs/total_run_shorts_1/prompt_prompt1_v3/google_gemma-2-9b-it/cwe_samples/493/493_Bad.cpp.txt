VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Configuration
EXPLANATION: The code directly embeds the configuration path "/etc/application/config.dat" as a string literal. This makes the application vulnerable to attacks if an attacker gains access to the system and modifies this hardcoded path.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use environment variables to store sensitive information like configuration paths.
- Implement a mechanism to read configuration
