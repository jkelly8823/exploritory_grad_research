VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly constructs a file path using string concatenation.  An attacker could potentially manipulate the value of the `configPath` variable to access files outside the intended directory. For example, if `configPath` were to be set to "/etc/application/config.dat../../etc/passwd", an attacker could potentially read sensitive system files.
