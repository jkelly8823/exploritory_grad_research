VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds array access
EXPLANATION:
The code contains a vulnerability where it accesses an array element beyond its valid index. When `index` is greater than or equal to `len`, the code executes `value = array[index]`, which attempts to read from a memory location outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to undefined behavior,
