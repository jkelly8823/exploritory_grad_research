VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the `gen_recv` function. The `gen_recv` function is responsible for reading data from a socket and storing it in the `buf` buffer. However, the size of the `buf` buffer is fixed at `BUFFER_SIZE`, and there is no explicit check
