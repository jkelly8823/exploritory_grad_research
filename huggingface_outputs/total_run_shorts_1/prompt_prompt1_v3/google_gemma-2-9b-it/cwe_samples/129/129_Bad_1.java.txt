VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code does not validate the `untrustedListSize` input against the maximum size of an array. A malicious actor could supply an extremely large value for `untrustedListSize`, potentially leading to an integer overflow. This could result in the allocation of an excessively large array, consuming excessive memory and potentially causing a denial-of-service
