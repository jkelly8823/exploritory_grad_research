VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Exception Handling
EXPLANATION:  The code catches all exceptions of type `Exception` without specifying a more specific exception type. This can mask potential issues and prevent proper error handling. It's best practice to catch specific exception types to handle them appropriately.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Catch specific exception types instead of the general `Exception` class.
- Log exceptions with relevant context for debugging.
