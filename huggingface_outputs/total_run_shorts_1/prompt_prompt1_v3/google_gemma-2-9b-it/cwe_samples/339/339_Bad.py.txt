VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of `os.urandom` for seeding a PRNG is not sufficient for cryptographic security.
EXPLANATION: 
While `os.urandom` is generally considered a good source of randomness, using only 2 bytes for seeding a PRNG is insufficient for cryptographic security. An attacker with knowledge of the seed could potentially predict future random numbers generated by the
