VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Heap Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to allocate memory using `malloc` but calculates the size using `sizeof(foo)`.  `sizeof(foo)` returns the size of the pointer variable `foo`, not the size of the array of doubles it intends to allocate. This will result in a heap overflow as the allocated memory is insufficient to hold the desired number
