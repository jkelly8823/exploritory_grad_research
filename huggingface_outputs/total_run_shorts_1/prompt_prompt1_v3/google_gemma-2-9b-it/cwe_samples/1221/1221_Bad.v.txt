VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code uses a hardcoded default value for the register that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
In the `register_top` module, the `Insecure_Device_ID_1` instance uses a default value of `1224` for the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter. This value is hardcoded and does not appear to be based on any security considerations.
