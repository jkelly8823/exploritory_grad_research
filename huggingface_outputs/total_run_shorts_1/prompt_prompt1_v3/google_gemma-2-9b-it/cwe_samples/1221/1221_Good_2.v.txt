VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability within the `for` loop. The loop iterates using the variable `j`, incrementing it by 1 in each iteration (`j=j+1`).  If `AcCt_MEM_SIZE` is a large value, there's a risk that `j` could
