VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Fallthrough Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a fallthrough vulnerability within the switch statement. Due to the lack of `break` statements after each case, the execution will "fall through" to the next case, effectively executing all cases from the current case onwards. This can lead to unintended behavior and security risks if the output of multiple cases is combined.
