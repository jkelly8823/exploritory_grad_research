VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Reference Equality
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses the `==` operator to compare two `BankAccount` objects. This performs reference equality, meaning it checks if the two objects refer to the same memory location. It does not compare the actual data within the objects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Override the `equals()` method in the `BankAccount` class to implement a meaningful comparison
