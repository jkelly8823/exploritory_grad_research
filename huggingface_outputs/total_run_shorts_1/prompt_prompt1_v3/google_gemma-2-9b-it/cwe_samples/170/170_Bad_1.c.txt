VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet reads data from `readlink(pathname, buf, MAXPATH)` into a buffer `buf` of size `MAXPATH`. However, it does not check if the length of the data read (`length`) exceeds the buffer size. If `readlink` returns more data than `MAXPATH`, it will overwrite memory
