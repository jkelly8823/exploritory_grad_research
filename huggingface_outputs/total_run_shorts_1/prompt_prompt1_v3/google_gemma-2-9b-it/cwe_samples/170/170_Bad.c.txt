VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6,7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code reads data from a file (`read(cfgfile,inputbuf,MAXLEN)`) without ensuring the input is null-terminated. Subsequently, `strcpy(pathbuf,inputbuf)` is used to copy the potentially oversized input into `pathbuf`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds `MAX
