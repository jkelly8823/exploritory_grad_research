VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Arbitrary Code Execution
EXPLANATION:
The `handleConfigAction` function dynamically constructs and executes code based on user input (`param('action')` and `param('key')`). This opens the door to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate these parameters to inject malicious code that would be executed by the `eval` function.
