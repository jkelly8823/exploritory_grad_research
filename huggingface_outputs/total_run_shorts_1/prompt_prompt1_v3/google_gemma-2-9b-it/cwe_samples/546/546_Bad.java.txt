VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential NullPointerException
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the `user` variable is null. If it is, the code includes a TODO comment indicating that the null condition should be handled. However, without any specific handling logic, accessing any properties or methods of the `user` object when it's null will result in a NullPointerException at runtime.
