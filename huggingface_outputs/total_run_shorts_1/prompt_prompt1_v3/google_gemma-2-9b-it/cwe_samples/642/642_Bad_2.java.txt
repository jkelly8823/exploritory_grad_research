VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code reads data from a file into an array `arr` without specifying the size of the array. If the file content is larger than the size of `arr`, it can lead to a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer (in this case, the `arr`)
