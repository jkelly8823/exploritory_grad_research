VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection

The code is vulnerable to command injection because the `$ENV{HOMEDIR}` variable is used directly in the `open` command without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the `ENV` variable to execute arbitrary commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in commands
