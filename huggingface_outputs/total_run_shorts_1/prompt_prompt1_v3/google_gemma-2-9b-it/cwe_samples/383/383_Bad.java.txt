VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
EXPLANATION:
The code creates a new thread for each incoming request without any limits or safeguards. This can lead to a DoS attack where an attacker can flood the server with requests, exhausting system resources and causing the server to become unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement thread pool management to limit the number of concurrent threads.
- Consider using asynchronous processing techniques
