VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Database Credentials
EXPLANATION: The database connection string `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysqldb` contains the database hostname, port, and name hardcoded. This makes the credentials easily accessible to anyone with access to the code, posing a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Store database credentials securely using environment variables or a configuration file
