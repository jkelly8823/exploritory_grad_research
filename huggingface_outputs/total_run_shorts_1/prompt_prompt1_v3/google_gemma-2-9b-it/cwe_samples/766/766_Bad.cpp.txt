VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Sensitive Data Exposure
EXPLANATION:  Storing a password as a plain text character array (`char* password`) is a severe security risk.  An attacker gaining access to the memory containing this variable could directly read the password.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Hash the password:**  Use a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
