VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABILITY_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly injects user-supplied input (`login.getUserName()` and `login.getPassword()`) into an XPath expression. This can lead to SQL injection if the underlying XML data is processed in a way that interprets the XPath expression as a SQL query. An attacker could craft malicious input to manipulate the XPath expression and execute arbitrary SQL commands
