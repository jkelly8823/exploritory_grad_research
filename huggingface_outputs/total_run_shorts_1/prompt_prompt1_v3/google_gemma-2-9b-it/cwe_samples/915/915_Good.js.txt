VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype Pollution Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code allows arbitrary property assignment on an object's prototype chain by iterating through a provided path and creating objects along the way. An attacker could craft a malicious path that targets the prototype of an object, potentially leading to the modification of shared properties across all instances of that object type.
