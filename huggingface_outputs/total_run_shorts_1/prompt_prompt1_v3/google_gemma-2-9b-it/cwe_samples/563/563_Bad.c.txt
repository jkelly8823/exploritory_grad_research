VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `getNewBuffer(buf)` function is likely responsible for allocating a new buffer. However, there's no check on the size of the input `buf` before copying it into the new buffer. If `buf` is larger than the allocated space in the new buffer, it
