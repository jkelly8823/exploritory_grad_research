VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `strncmp` function in the code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The function compares the hostname retrieved from `gethostbyaddr` (`hp->h_name`) with the hardcoded hostname `tHost`.  If the hostname retrieved is longer than the size of `tHost`, a buffer overflow will occur
