VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `recvfrom` function call. The `recvfrom` function receives data from a socket and stores it in the provided buffer (`msg`). However, the buffer size (`MAX_MSG`) is not explicitly checked against the incoming data length. If the received data exceeds `MAX
