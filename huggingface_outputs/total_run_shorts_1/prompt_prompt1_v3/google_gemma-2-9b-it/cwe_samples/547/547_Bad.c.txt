VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `fgets` function reads user input from `stdin` and stores it in the `buffer` array, which has a fixed size of 1024 bytes. If the user enters more than 1024 bytes of input, the excess data will overflow the allocated
