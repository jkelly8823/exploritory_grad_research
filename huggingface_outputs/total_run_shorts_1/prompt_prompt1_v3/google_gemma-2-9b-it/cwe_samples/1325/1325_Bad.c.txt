VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11,12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Heap Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `alloca` to allocate memory on the stack. However, the allocated memory is not freed after use. This can lead to a heap overflow vulnerability if the `end_limit` variable is large enough. As the loop iterates, it keeps allocating memory on the stack, which eventually overflows the stack
