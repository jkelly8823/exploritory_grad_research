VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to write to `id_sequence[3]`, but the array `id_sequence` is only declared to hold 3 elements (indices 0, 1, and 2). Accessing an index beyond the bounds of an array leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This can allow attackers to overwrite adjacent memory locations
