VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The `strcat` function appends a string to an existing string without checking the size of the destination buffer. In this case, `str` is declared as a character array of size 20. If the input string "hello world" is longer than 19 characters (including the null terminator), it will overflow the buffer
