VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user-supplied data (`username` and `accountNumber`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate these values to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This involves
