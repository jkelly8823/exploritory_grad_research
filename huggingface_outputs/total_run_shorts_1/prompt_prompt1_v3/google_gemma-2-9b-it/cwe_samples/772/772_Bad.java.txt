VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:

The `BufferedReader` object is used to read lines from a file, but there is no explicit check on the length of the input lines. If a malicious actor were to provide a file containing extremely long lines, it could potentially overflow the buffer allocated for `line`, leading to a buffer
