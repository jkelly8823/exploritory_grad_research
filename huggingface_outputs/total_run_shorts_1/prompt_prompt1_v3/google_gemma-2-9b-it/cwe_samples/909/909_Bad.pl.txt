VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:  The code snippet uses `GetCurrentUser()` and `GetStateData()` which could be susceptible to SQL injection if these functions construct SQL queries using user input without proper sanitization.  An attacker could potentially manipulate the `$username` variable to inject malicious SQL code into the queries, leading to data breaches or other security issues.
