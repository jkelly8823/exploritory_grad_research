VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Indirect Branch
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability known as an indirect branch. An attacker can control the value of `rsi`, which points to the address of the jump target. This allows the attacker to redirect the program flow to arbitrary code locations, potentially executing malicious instructions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using indirect branches whenever possible.
- If indirect
