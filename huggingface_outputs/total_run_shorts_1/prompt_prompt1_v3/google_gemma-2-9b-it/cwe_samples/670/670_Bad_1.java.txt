VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a NullPointerException
EXPLANATION: 
While the code asserts that `email` should not be null, it doesn't handle the case where `request.getParameter("email_address")` could return null. If the user doesn't provide an email address, this assertion will fail, leading to a runtime exception.
