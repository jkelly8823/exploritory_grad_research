VULNERABILITY:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `value = buf[match.end(2) + 1:match.start(1) + length - 1]` extracts a substring from the `buf` variable based on the captured `length` value. If `length` is larger than the remaining bytes in
