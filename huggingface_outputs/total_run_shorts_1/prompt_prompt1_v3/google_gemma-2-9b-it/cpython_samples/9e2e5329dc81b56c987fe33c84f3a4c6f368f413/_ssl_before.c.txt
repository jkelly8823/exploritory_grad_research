VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Default SSL/TLS Configuration
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `SSL_VERIFY_NONE` which disables certificate verification. This means that the server will accept any certificate presented by the client, regardless of its validity or authenticity. This is a major security risk as it allows man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of spoofing.
