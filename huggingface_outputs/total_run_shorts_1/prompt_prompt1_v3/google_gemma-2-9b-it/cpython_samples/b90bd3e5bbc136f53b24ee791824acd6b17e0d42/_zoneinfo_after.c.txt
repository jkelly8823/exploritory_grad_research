VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `utcoff` and `dstoff` but does not deallocate it. This can lead to a memory leak if the function exits without freeing these pointers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add `free(utcoff);` and `free(dstoff);` before the `cleanup`
