VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `wchar_t fullpath[MAXPATHLEN];` declares a buffer named `fullpath` with a fixed size of `MAXPATHLEN`. If a path longer than `MAXPATHLEN` is passed to the function, it will overflow the buffer
