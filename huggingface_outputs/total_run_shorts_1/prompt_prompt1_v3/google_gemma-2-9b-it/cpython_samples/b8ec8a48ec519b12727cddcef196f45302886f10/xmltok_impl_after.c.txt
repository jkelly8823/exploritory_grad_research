VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line 6, Line 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while (ptr < end)` loop iterates through a buffer pointed to by `ptr`. The `switch` statement processes each byte based on its type. The `LEAD_CASE` macro expands to handle different lead byte types.

The issue arises from
