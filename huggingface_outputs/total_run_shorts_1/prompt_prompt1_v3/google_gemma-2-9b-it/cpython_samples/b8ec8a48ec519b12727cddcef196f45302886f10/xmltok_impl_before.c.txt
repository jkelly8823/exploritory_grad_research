VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while (ptr != end)` loop iterates through a buffer pointed to by `ptr`. The `switch` statement processes each byte based on its type. However, the `LEAD_CASE` macro expands based on the byte type, potentially leading to an
