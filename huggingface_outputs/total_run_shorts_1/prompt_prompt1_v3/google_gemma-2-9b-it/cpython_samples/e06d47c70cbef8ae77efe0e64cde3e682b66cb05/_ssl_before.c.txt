VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `len = BIO_gets(biobuf, buf, sizeof(buf)-1);` is susceptible to an overflow. The `BIO_gets` function reads data from the `biobuf` BIO object into the `buf`
