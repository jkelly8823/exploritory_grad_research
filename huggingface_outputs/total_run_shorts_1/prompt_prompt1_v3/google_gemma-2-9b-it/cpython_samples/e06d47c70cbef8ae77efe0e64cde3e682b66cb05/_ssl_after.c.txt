VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 29-31
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `BIO_gets(biobuf, buf, sizeof(buf)-1)` line. The `BIO_gets` function reads data from a BIO object (biobuf) and stores it in the `buf` buffer. The `sizeof(buf)-
