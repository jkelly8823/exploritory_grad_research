VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `readline(_MAXLINE + 1)` function call reads data from the file object (`self.file`) into a buffer with a maximum size of `_MAXLINE + 1`. However, the code does not adequately handle the case where the input line exceeds this buffer size
