VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4, 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the size of a table (`tablen`) based on image dimensions and data type. The calculation `tablen = xsize * ysize * zsize * sizeof(Py_Int32)` can potentially lead to an integer overflow if the product of these values exceeds the
