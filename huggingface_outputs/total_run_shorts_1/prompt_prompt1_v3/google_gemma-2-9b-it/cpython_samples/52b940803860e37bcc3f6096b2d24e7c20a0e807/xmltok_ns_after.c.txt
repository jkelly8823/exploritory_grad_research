VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 49
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `XmlUtf8Convert` function is used to convert an encoding to UTF-8. However, the `XmlUtf8Convert` function does not have any bounds checking on the input buffer size. This means that if the input string is larger than the `ENCODING_MAX` buffer size, a buffer overflow will occur.
