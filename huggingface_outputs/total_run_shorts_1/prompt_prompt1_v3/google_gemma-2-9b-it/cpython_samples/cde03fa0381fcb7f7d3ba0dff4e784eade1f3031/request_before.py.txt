VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Input Validation
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability due to improper input validation. Specifically, the code relies on string comparisons (`name[-6:] == '_proxy'`) to determine if a variable should be processed as a proxy configuration.  An attacker could potentially craft malicious input that bypasses this check, leading to unintended
