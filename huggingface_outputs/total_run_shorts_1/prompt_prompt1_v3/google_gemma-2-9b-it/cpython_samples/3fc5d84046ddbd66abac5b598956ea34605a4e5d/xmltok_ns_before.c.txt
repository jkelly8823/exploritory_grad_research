VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `XmlUtf8Convert` function is used to convert a character pointer (`ptr`) to a UTF-8 encoded string. The conversion result is written to a buffer (`buf`) of fixed size (`ENCODING_MAX`). If the input string (`ptr`) is longer than `ENCODING
