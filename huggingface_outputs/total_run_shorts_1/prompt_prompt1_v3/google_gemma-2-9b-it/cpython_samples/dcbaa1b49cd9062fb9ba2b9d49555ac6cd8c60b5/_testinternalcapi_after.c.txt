VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `GetModuleFileNameW(hPython3, py3path, MAX_PATH)` is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability. If the path to the Python3 DLL is longer than `MAX_PATH` characters, the function will write beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a crash
