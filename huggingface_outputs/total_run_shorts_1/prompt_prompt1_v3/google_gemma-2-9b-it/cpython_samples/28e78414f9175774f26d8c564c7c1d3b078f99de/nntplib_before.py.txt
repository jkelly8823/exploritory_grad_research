VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided shows a function call to `self.file.readline()`.  Without knowing the context of `self.file`, it's impossible to definitively say if a buffer overflow vulnerability exists. However, if `self.file` represents a file-like object that reads data from an
