VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-31
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly calls audioop functions with potentially large input sizes (`size`) and performs arithmetic operations on these sizes. Integer overflow can occur if the size values exceed the maximum representable value for the integer data type used. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
