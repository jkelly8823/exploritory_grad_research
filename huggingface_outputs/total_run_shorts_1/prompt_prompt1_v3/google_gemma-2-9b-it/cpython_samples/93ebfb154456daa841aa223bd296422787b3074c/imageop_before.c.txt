VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code snippet contains multiple instances of potential buffer overflows. 
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly calculates the required size of a string based on various parameters (x, y, size) and then allocates memory using `PyString_FromStringAndSize`. However, it does not adequately validate the input values for x, y, and size. If these values are maliciously crafted, an attacker could potentially cause a
