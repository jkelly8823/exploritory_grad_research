VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to excessive wildcard handling.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates testing for wildcard certificate handling. While the tests aim to ensure proper behavior, the line `cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'a*b.co*'),),)}`  could potentially lead to a DoS vulnerability if exploited.  An attacker could craft a malicious certificate with an
