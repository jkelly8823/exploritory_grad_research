VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 10, 19, 28
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code modifies the `sys.set_int_max_str_digits()` setting, which controls the maximum number of digits allowed in integer string representations. Setting this value to 7000 could potentially lead to integer overflow issues if the code later attempts to
