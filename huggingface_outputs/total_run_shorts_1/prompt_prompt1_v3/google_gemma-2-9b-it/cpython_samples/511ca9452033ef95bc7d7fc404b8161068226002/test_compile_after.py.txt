VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Unsafe use of eval()
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses the `eval()` function to evaluate strings containing arbitrary code. This is highly dangerous as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.  An attacker could craft malicious input that would be evaluated by `eval()`, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other security issues
