VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `_Py_ID` function is used to retrieve object identifiers, which are likely integers. The code then compares these identifiers to `_PyObject_IMMORTAL_REFCNT`, which
