VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential for an infinite loop. The `delay` variable is repeatedly multiplied by 2 and compared to `max_delay`. If `delay` exceeds `max_delay`, the loop will continue indefinitely.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a counter to limit the number of iterations.
2.
