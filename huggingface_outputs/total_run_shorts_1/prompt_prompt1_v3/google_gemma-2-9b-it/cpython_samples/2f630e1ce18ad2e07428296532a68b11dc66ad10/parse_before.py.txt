VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `replace()` method, when used without bounds checking, can lead to a buffer overflow if the replacement string is longer than the original string. In this case, the code iterates through a list of unsafe bytes and replaces them with
