VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reads a line from a socket using `self.file.readline(_MAXLINE + 1)`.  While it sets a maximum line length of _MAXLINE, the `+ 1`  could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if a received line is longer than _MAX
