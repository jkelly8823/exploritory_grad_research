VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-31
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to repeated calls to audioop functions with invalid data.
EXPLANATION:
The code iterates through a list of `INVALID_DATA` tuples, each containing invalid data and a size. For each tuple, it repeatedly calls various audioop functions with the invalid data and size. This can lead to
