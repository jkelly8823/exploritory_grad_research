VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Default SSL/TLS Configuration
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `SSL_VERIFY_NONE` which disables certificate verification. This means that the application will not validate the authenticity of the server's certificate, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, `SSL_OP_ALL` enables all SSL/TLS options
