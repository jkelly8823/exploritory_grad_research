VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `self.rfile.read(chunk_size)` function reads data from a file-like object. If `chunk_size` is larger than the available data in the file, it can lead to a buffer overflow. This occurs because the `read()` function might attempt to
