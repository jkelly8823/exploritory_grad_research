VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reads data from `self.rfile` in chunks. While this is generally safe, the absence of bounds checking on the `chunk_size` variable could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. If `size_remaining` is manipulated to be larger than the available memory, `self.rfile.read(chunk
