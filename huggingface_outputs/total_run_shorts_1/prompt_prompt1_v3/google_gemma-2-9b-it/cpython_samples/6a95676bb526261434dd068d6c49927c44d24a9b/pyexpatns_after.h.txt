VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
EXPLANATION:  The code snippet defines macros that map XML parser functions to Python equivalents. While this doesn't directly demonstrate XXE, it sets the stage for it.  XXE vulnerabilities arise when an XML parser allows external entities to be loaded and processed. If the underlying Python `PyExpat` library doesn
