VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
EXPLANATION:  The code snippet defines macros that map C functions to Python functions. While this doesn't directly demonstrate XXE, it sets the stage for it.  XXE vulnerabilities arise when an application parses XML input without properly sanitizing it. If the application using these macros allows user-controlled XML input
