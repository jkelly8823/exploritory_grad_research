VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION: 
The code dynamically constructs a method name (`name`) based on user input (`urltype`). This could lead to RCE if an attacker can manipulate `urltype` to call a malicious method that exists elsewhere in the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize and validate `urltype` to prevent arbitrary method name construction.
- Consider
