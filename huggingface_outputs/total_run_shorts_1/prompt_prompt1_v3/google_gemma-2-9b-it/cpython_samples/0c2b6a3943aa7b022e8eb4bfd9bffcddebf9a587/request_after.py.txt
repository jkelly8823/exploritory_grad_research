VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION: 
The code dynamically constructs a variable name (`name`) based on user input (`urltype`). This variable name is then used to access an attribute of the `self` object. If an attacker can control the value of `urltype`, they could potentially craft a malicious input that results
