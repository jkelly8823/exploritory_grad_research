VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `readline` function does not properly handle the `limit` parameter. If `limit` is set to a value greater than the length of the line, it can lead to a buffer overflow. This is because the code inserts the truncated line back into the `lines` list, potentially overwriting adjacent data.
