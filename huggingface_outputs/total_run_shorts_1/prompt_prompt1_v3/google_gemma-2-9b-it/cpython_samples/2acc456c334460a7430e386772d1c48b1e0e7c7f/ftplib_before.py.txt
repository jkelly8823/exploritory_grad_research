VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `getline` method. The `while 1` loop reads data from the file (`fp.readline()`) and appends it to a buffer without checking the buffer size. If the incoming data exceeds the buffer capacity, it can overwrite
