VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `offset = int(self.rest)` is vulnerable to an integer overflow. If `self.rest` contains a very large integer value, the `int()` conversion could result in an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the input value of `self.rest` before
