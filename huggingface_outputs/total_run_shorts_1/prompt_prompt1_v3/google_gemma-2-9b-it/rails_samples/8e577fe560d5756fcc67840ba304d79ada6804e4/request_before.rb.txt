VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The line `LOCALHOST =~ remote_addr && LOCALHOST =~ remote_ip` appears to be performing a comparison using the `=~` operator, which is often used for regular expression matching in Ruby. If `remote_addr` or `remote_ip` are user-supplied input, this could lead to SQL injection
