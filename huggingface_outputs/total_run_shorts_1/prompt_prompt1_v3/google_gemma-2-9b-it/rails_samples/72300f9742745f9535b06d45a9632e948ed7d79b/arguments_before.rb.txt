VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for YAML Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses the `argument` string without proper sanitization when handling the `String` case. This opens the door for YAML injection attacks if the `argument` originates from an untrusted source. An attacker could craft a malicious string that, when deserialized, could execute arbitrary code or cause other unintended consequences.
