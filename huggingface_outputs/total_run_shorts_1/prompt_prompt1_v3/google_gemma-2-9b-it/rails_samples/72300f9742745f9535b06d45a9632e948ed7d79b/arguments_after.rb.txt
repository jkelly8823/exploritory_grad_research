VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Recursive Deserialization Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a recursive deserialization process. While the intent is likely to deserialize nested data structures, the lack of a clear termination condition within the `when Array` case presents a risk. If `argument` contains an array with deeply nested structures, the recursive calls could potentially lead to an infinite loop or stack overflow
