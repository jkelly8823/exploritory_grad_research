VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Session ID Exposure
EXPLANATION: The code directly exposes the user's session ID in the response. This can lead to session hijacking attacks where an attacker can steal the user's session and impersonate them.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Do not directly expose the session ID in the response.
- Consider using a secure token-based authentication system.
