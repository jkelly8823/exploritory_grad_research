VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Cache Poisoning
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability to cache poisoning. Specifically, the `find_session` method attempts to retrieve a session from the cache using both the private and public IDs of the session. If an attacker can manipulate the cache to store a malicious session with a valid public ID, they could potentially
