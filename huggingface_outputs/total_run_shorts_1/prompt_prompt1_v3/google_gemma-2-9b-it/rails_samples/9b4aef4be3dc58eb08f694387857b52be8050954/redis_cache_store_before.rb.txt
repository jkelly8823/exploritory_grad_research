VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for deserialization vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `Marshal.load` to deserialize entries from the cache. This can be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if malicious data is stored in the cache. An attacker could craft serialized data that, when loaded, executes arbitrary code on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using `Marshal.load` for deserialization.
- Consider using a safer serialization format
