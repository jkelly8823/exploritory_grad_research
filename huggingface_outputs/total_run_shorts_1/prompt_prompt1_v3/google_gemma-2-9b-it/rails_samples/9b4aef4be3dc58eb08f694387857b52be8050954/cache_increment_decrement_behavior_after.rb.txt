VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code does not handle potential integer overflow when incrementing or decrementing values in the cache. If the cached value is already very large, incrementing it could result in an overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. Similarly, decrementing a very small value could result in an underflow.
