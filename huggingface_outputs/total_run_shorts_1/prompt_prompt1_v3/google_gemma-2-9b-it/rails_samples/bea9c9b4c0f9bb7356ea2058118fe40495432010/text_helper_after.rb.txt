VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `raw(paragraph)` without proper sanitization. This means that if `paragraph` contains malicious JavaScript code, it will be directly injected into the HTML output, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the `paragraph` content
