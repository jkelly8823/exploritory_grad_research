VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
EXPLANATION:
The code lacks proper error handling for the `rescue` block. If an error occurs within the `begin` block, the `rescue` block will catch it, but it doesn't prevent the `state.complete!` call from executing. This could lead to a DoS attack
