VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `exec_no_cache` method directly constructs and executes an SQL query using the `@connection.async_exec` method. The `sql` variable, which presumably holds the SQL query string, is concatenated with user-supplied data (`binds`) without proper sanitization
