VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Timing Attack
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet implements a constant-time string comparison function, `secure_compare`, but it appears to be incomplete. The line `res == 0` is likely intended to perform a constant-time comparison, but it lacks the actual comparison logic. This could lead to a timing attack vulnerability, where an attacker could
