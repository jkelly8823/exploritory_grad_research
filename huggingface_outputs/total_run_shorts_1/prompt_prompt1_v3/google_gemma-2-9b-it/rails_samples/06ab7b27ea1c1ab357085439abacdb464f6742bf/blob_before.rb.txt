VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
The `service.url` method accepts user-supplied data (`filename`, `content_type`, `options`) which are directly concatenated into the URL without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
