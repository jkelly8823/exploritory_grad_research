VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `blob.key` directly in the URL construction. If `blob.key` is user-supplied or not properly sanitized, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious `blob.key` that includes SQL code, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
