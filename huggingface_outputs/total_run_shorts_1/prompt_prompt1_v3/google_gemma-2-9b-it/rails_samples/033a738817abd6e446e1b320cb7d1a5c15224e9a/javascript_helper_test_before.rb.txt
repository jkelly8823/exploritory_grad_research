VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses string interpolation with user-supplied data (`%(dont <\\/close> tags)` and `%(dont </close> tags)`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the output. For example, an attacker could provide input that includes `<script>alert('XSS')
