VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`record`).  The `@key_strategy.call record.model_name` line could potentially lead to SQL injection if `record.model_name` is not properly escaped before being used in a database query.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement parameterized queries
