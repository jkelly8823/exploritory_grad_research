VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet processes user-supplied input (`options[:file]`) without proper sanitization. This could lead to a path traversal vulnerability if an attacker provides a malicious file path. For example, an attacker could craft
