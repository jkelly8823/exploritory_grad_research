VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for `MissingTemplate` exception if no templates are found.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for the existence of templates using `find_all` and raises a `MissingTemplate` exception if no templates are found. However, the `find_all` method itself might not handle the case of no templates gracefully, potentially leading to an unexpected exception.
