VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow/Underflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if an integer value is within the range of a signed 64-bit integer. However, the check only considers the upper and lower bounds of the 64-bit range. It does not account for potential integer overflow or underflow issues that could occur if the input value is too large
