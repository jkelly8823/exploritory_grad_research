VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code parses XML data from a string.  Without proper sanitization of the `data` variable, an attacker could inject malicious XML code that references external entities. This could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the system, perform denial-of-service attacks, or execute arbitrary code.
