VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly embeds user-supplied input (`location`) into an HTML page without proper sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious URL in the `location` parameter, which would be rendered as part of the HTML response.
