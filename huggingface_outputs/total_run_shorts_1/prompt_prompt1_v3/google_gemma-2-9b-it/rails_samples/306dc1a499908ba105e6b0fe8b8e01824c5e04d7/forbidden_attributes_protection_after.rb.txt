VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Mass Assignment Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to define a method `sanitize_forbidden_attributes` which is aliased as `sanitize_for_mass_assignment`.  Without further context, it's impossible to determine the exact implementation of this method. However, the naming strongly suggests that it's intended to sanitize attributes before mass assignment.
