VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Mass Assignment Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential mass assignment vulnerability.  The `assign_attributes` method, if not properly protected, could allow an attacker to set arbitrary attributes on the `person` object, potentially including sensitive data. This is because the code directly assigns attributes from a hash (`ProtectedParams.new({}))` without any
