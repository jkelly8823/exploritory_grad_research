VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly inserts user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection attacks, where malicious users can manipulate the query to execute unintended commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries to separate data from SQL commands.
- Sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters.
