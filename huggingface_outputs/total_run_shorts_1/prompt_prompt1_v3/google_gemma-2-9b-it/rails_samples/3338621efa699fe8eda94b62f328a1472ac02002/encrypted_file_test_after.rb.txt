VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The `assert_equal` statement in the first test case directly compares user-supplied content (`#{@content}`) with the contents of the encrypted file (`@encrypted_file.read`). If `#{@content}` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into this string, potentially leading to SQL injection
