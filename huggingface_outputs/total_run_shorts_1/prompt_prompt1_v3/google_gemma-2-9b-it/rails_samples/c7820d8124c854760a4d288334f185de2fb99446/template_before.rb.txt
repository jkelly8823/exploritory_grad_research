VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `File.basename(@virtual_path)` to extract the base name from a potentially user-supplied `@virtual_path` variable. If `@virtual_path` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could craft a malicious input that leads to accessing files outside the intended directory structure, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing for arbitrary file execution.
