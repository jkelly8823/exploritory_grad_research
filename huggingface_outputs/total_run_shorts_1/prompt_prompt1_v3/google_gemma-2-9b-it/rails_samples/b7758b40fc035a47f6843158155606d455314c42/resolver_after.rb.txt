VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential for Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `build_query` method is responsible for constructing a glob pattern based on the provided `path` and `details`. However, the code snippet does not demonstrate any sanitization or validation of the `path` input. This could lead to a path traversal vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the `path`
