VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 6, 7, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for `MissingTemplate` exception due to lack of error handling in `find_all` and `find_file` methods.
EXPLANATION:
The code raises a `MissingTemplate` exception if no matching template is found. However, there is no explicit error handling mechanism to gracefully handle this situation
