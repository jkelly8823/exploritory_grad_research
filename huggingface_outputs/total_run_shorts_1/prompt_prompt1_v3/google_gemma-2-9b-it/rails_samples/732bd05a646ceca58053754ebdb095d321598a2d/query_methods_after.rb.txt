VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a SQL query that is vulnerable to SQL injection. The query uses user input directly within the SQL statement without any proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries
