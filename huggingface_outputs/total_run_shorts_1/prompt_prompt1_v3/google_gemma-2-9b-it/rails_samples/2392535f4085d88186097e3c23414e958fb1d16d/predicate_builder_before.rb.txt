VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user-supplied data (`value`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization. The `column` variable, which is likely obtained from user input, is used to construct the query, making it susceptible to malicious code injection.
