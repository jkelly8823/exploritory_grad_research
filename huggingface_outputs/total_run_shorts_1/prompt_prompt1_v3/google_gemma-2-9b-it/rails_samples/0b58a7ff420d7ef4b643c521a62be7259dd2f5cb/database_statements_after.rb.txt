VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `WHERE` clause in the SQL query dynamically constructs the query string using user-supplied input (`#{quoted_primary_key}` and `#{quoted_table_name}`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially compromising the database.
