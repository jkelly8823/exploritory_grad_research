VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Key Derivation Weakness
EXPLANATION: 
The code generates a key using `ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator` with a fixed salt (`b3c631c314c0bbca50c1b2843150fe33`).  Using a fixed salt in a key derivation function can lead to a key
