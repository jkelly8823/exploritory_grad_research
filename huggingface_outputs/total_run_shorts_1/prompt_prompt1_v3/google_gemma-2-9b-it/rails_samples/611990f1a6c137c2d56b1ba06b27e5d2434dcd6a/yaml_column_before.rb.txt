VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: YAML Deserialization Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code includes a `yaml_load` method that uses `YAML.unsafe_load` if the YAML library supports it. `YAML.unsafe_load` allows arbitrary code execution if the YAML payload is maliciously crafted. This is a serious vulnerability as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.
