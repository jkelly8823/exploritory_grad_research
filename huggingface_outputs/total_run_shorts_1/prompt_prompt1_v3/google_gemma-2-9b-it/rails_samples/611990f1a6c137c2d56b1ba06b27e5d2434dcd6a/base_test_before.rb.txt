VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The `update!` method on the `Topic` model is likely using SQL to update the database. The `payload` variable is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization. This means that an attacker could craft a malicious payload containing SQL code that could be executed by the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input
