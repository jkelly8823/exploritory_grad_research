VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: YAML Deserialization Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allows applications to opt into using `unsafe_load` on the `ActiveStorage::Coders::YamlColumn`. Using `unsafe_load` for YAML deserialization is highly vulnerable to arbitrary code execution attacks. An attacker could craft malicious YAML data that, when deserialized using `unsafe_load`, would
