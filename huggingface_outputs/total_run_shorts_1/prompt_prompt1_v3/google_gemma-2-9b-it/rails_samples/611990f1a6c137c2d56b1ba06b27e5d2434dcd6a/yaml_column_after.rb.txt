VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: YAML Deserialization Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code allows for arbitrary code execution through YAML deserialization. The `yaml_load` method uses `YAML.load` or `YAML.unsafe_load` without proper sanitization, which can allow attackers to inject malicious YAML payloads that execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize all YAML input before deserialization.
