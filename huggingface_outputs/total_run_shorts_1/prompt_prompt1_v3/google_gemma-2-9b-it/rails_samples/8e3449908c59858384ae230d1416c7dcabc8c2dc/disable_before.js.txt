VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks proper sanitization of user input. The `element` variable is directly assigned the value of `e.target` without any validation or escaping. If a malicious user interacts with the page and provides crafted input, it could potentially be injected into the DOM as part of the `element` variable. This could lead to XSS vulnerabilities
