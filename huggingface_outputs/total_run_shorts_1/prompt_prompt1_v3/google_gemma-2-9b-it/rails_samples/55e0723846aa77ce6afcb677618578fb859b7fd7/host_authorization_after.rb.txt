VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `Regexp.escape` to escape special characters in the `host` variable. However, if the `host` variable contains a long string with many special characters, the resulting regular expression can be extremely complex and computationally expensive to evaluate. This can lead to a denial of service attack,
