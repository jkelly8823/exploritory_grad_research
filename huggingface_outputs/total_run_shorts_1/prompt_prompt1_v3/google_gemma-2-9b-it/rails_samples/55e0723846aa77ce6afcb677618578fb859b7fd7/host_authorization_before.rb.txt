VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular expression injection vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code constructs regular expressions based on user input (`host`).  Without proper sanitization, an attacker could craft malicious input that modifies the regular expression's behavior, potentially leading to unintended data access or code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input (`host`) before using it in regular expressions.
-
