VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The code snippet uses a regular expression `TOKEN_REGEX` to match the beginning of a token string. However, it does not sanitize user input before using it with this regular expression. If a malicious user can inject arbitrary data into the input, they could potentially craft a payload that exploits this vulnerability
