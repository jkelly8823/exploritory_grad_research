VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Secret Key Exposure
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals a potential vulnerability related to the handling of the `secret_key_base`.  In line 10, the `secret_key_base` is directly assigned a hardcoded value. This practice is highly discouraged as it exposes the secret key directly in the code, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access
