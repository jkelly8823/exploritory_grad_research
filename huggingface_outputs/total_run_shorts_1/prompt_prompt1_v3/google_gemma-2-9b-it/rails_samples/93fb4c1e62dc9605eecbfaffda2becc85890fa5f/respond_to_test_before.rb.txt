VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a test case where the response body contains 'alert(JS)'. This string, if directly injected into a web page, could be interpreted as JavaScript code by a user's browser. An attacker could manipulate the input to the `:json_with_callback` route to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
