VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates the use of a dependency management system, likely within a Ruby on Rails project. It defines dependencies for both production and development environments. There are no immediately apparent vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
While not a vulnerability, consider using explicit version constraints for dependencies whenever possible to ensure consistency and avoid potential compatibility issues.
