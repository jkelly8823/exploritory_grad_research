VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet assigns integer values to variables.  While not directly shown, the context suggests these values might be used in calculations.  If these integers are not properly bounded, operations like addition or multiplication could result in integer overflow. Integer overflow occurs when a calculation produces a result that is too large to be represented by the data
