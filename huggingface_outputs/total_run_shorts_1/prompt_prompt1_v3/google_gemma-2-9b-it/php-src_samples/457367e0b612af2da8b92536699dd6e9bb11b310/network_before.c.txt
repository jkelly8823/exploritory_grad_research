VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `strpprintf(0, ...)` which is a potentially vulnerable function. `strpprintf` can lead to buffer overflows if the format string is not properly sanitized and the provided arguments are not carefully controlled.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace `strpprintf` with a safer alternative
