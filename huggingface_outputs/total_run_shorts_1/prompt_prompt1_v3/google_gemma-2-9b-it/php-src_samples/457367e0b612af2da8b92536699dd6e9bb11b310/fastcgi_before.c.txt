VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
Lines 10 and 11 demonstrate a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The code attempts to assign the value of `tmp` to `in_len`, but `tmp` is not checked for potential overflow before assignment. If `tmp` exceeds the maximum value for an `unsigned int` or `int`
