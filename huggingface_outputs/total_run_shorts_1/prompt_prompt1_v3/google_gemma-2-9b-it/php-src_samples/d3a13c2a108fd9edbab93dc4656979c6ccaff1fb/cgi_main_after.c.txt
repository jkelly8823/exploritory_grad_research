VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a call to `php_getopt` which parses command-line arguments.  The `php_getopt` function can be vulnerable to buffer overflows if the input arguments are not properly sanitized. If an attacker provides a maliciously crafted command-line argument, it could potentially overflow the buffer allocated
