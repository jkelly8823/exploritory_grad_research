VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. In lines 10 and 13, the `php_stream_read` function reads data from a stream into a buffer of fixed size. If the data received exceeds the buffer size, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to a buffer overflow.
