VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet checks if the maximum value of an integer (`PHP_INT_MAX`) is 2147483647. This value is typical for 32-bit systems. If it's not, the script dies, indicating it's not suitable for 32-bit systems. This is a conditional check, not a vulnerability.
