VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses `var_dump()` to display the contents of the `$value` variable.  Without proper sanitization, if `$value` originates from user input, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it in any database queries.
