VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates through the `keybuf` array, potentially writing data beyond its allocated bounds. The `q - (u_char *) keybuf` expression calculates the current position within `keybuf`. If the `key` value is large enough, the loop might
