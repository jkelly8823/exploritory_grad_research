VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `strlen(func_name)` to determine the length of the `func_name` string. If `func_name` is a user-controlled input, an attacker could provide a maliciously crafted string longer than the allocated buffer, leading to a
