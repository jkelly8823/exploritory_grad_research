VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a call to `php_getopt` which parses command-line arguments. The `php_getopt` function expects a string argument representing the options. If the input string is not properly sanitized, an attacker could provide a maliciously crafted string that exceeds the allocated buffer size, leading
