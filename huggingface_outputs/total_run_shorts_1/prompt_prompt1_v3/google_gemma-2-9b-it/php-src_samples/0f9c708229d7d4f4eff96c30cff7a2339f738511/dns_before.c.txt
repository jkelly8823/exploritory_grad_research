VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `php_gethostbyname` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability occurs because the function does not properly validate the length of the hostname input. An attacker could provide a hostname that is longer than the buffer allocated for it, causing data to be written beyond the intended memory location. This can lead to arbitrary code execution
