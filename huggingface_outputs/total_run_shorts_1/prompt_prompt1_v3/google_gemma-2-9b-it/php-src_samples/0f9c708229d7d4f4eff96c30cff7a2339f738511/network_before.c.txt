VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses `spprintf` to construct an error message. `spprintf` is a potentially unsafe function as it does not perform bounds checking on the output buffer. If the `error_string` buffer is too small to hold the formatted error message, a buffer overflow could
