VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `safe_emalloc` which is likely a wrapper around `malloc`. However, the calculation of the memory size for `wbmp->bitmap` is potentially vulnerable. 

The line `if ((wbmp->bitmap = (int *) safe_emalloc(wbmp->width * wbmp->height, sizeof(int), 0)) ==
