VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code repeatedly allocates memory using `safe_emalloc` and `gdMalloc` without ensuring that the allocated size is within safe bounds. This can lead to buffer overflows if `width` or `height`
