VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the code due to the use of `safe_emalloc` and unchecked input values.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates several potential vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows. 

1. **Unchecked Input:** The `overflow2` function is called with `sizeof(int)` and potentially user-controlled values like `width` and `height`. If these values are manipulated maliciously,
