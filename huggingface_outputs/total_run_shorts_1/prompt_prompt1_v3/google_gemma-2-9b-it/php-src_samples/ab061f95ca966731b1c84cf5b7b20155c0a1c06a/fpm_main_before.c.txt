VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;` concatenates `script_path_translated` with `ptlen` to form `path_info`. If `ptlen` is larger than the allocated memory for `path_info`, it can lead
