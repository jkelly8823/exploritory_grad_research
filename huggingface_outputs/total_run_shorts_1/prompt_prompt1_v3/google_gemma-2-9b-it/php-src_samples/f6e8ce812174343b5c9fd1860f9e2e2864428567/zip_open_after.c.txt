VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reads data from memory pointed to by `cdp` using `_zip_read8`.  Without knowing the size of the buffer pointed to by `cdp`, it is possible that reading 8 bytes in each of the `_zip_read8` calls could exceed the allocated buffer size, leading to
