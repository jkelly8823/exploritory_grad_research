VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reads two bytes from memory using `_zip_read8(&cdp)`.  Without knowing the size of the `cdp` buffer, it is possible that reading these two bytes could overflow the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate the size of the `
