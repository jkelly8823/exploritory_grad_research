VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Input Validation
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet lacks any input validation for the `$xml` variable. This means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious XML code into the system.  If the `$xml` variable contains untrusted data, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or gain unauthorized access
