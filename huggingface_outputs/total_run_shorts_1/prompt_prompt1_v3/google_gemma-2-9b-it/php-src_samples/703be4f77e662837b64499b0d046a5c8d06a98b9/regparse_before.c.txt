VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The assignment of values to `*state` and `*type` without bounds checking could lead to data overwriting beyond the allocated memory space. This can result in unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even malicious code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking
