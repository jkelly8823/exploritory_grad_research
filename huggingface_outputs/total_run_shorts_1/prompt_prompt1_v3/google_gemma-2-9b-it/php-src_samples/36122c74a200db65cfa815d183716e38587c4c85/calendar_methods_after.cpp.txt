VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be parsing parameters using `zend_parse_parameters_none()`.  While this function itself doesn't directly involve SQL queries, the lack of input sanitization or validation creates a potential vulnerability. If user-supplied data is later used in SQL queries without proper escaping or filtering, it could lead to SQL injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement
