VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `thestr = strbuf + ASN1_STRING_length(timestr) - 3;` calculates a pointer `thestr` to a location within the `strbuf` buffer. However, the subsequent calls to `atoi(thestr)` and `*
