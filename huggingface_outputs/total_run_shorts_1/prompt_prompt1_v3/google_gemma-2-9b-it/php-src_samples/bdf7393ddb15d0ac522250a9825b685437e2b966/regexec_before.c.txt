VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates over a pointer `p` and increments it based on the result of `enclen(reg->enc, p)`.  Without knowing the implementation of `enclen`, it's impossible to determine if it could potentially write beyond the bounds of the
