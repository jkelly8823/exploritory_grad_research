VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `safe_emalloc` function allocates memory for a buffer of size `length + (((3 * length)/(PHP_QPRINT_MAXL-9)) + 1)`. However, the loop iterates through the input string `str` and writes characters to the buffer
