VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `gethostbyname()` function, when resolving a hostname, can potentially return a host address longer than the allocated buffer size. If the returned address is larger than the buffer, it can overwrite adjacent memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a fixed
