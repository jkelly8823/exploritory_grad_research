VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while (s < end)` loop iterates over the input string `s` until it reaches the end pointer `end`. However, there is no check on the size of the output buffer `conv`. If the input string is longer than the output buffer, it can
