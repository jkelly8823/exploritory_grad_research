VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `__asm__` instructions perform multiplication and addition operations on `res` and `overflow` variables. If the product of `size` and `offset` exceeds the maximum value representable by `size_t` or `unsigned long`, an integer overflow will
