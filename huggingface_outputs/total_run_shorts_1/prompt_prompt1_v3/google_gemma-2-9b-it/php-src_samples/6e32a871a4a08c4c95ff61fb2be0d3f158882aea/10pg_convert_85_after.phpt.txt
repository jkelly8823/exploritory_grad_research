VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly inserts user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper sanitization. The `$fields` array contains data that could be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, or modify database content.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries
