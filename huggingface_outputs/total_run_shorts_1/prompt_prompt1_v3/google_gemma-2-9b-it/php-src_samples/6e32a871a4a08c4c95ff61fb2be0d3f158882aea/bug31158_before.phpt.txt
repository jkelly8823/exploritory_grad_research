VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper use of global variables
EXPLANATION:
The code directly modifies the global variable `$GLOBALS['a']`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. Accessing and modifying global variables directly can make code harder to understand, debug, and maintain. It can also introduce unintended side effects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Avoid using global variables whenever possible.
