VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code directly inserts user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or system compromise.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This involves separating the data from the SQL query
