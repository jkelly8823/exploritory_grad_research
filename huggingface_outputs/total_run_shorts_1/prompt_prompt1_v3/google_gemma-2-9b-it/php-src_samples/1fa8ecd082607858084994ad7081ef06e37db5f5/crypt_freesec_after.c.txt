VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates through the `keybuf` buffer, potentially writing more data than the buffer can hold. 

The `*q++ = *key << 1;` line shifts the value of `*key` left by one bit and stores the
