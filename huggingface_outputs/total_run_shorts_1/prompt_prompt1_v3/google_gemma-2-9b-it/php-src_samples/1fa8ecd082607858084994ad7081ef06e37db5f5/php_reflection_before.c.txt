VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `*return_value = *precv->op2.zv;` directly dereferences `*precv->op2.zv` and stores the result into `*return_value`. If `precv->op2.zv` points to a buffer that is smaller than the amount of data being read
