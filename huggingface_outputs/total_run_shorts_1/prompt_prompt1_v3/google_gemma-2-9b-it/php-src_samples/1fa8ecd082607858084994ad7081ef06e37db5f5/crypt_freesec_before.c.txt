VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates through the `keybuf` array, potentially writing data beyond its allocated bounds. The condition `q - (u_char *) keybuf < sizeof(keybuf)` checks if the current position `q` is within the buffer's size. However
