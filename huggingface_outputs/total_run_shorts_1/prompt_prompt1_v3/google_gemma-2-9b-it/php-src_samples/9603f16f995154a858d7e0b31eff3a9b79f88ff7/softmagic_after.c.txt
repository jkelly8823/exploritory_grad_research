VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11, 12, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `bytecnt_max` variable is calculated based on the input buffer size (`nbytes`) and the offset (`offset`). However, the calculation does not adequately account for potential overflows when `bytecnt` is larger than
