VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `zip_get_file_comment` function is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The code does not adequately validate the length of the comment before copying it into the `comment` variable. If the comment is longer than the allocated space for `comment`, it could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code
