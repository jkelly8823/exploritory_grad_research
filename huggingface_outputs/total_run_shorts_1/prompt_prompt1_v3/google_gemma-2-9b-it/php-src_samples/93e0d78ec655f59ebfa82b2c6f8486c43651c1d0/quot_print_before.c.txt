VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `safe_emalloc` function allocates memory based on the `length` variable. However, the subsequent loop iterates through the input string (`str`) and writes data to the `ret` buffer without proper bounds checking. If the input string is longer than the allocated memory
