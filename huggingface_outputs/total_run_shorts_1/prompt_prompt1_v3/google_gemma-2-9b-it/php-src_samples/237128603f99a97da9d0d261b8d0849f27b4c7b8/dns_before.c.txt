VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `php_gethostbyname` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. This function takes a hostname as input and returns the corresponding IP address. If the hostname is longer than the buffer allocated for it, a buffer overflow can occur. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to code execution.
