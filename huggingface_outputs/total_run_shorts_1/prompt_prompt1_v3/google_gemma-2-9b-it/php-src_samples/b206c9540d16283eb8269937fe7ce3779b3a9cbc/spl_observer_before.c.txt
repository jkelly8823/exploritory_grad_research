VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `strncpy(hash, (char *)&zvalue, hash_len);` copies data from `zvalue` into the `hash` buffer. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the length of the data being copied (`sizeof(zend_object_
