VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet assigns integer values to variables.  While not directly shown, the context suggests these values might be used in calculations.  If these integers are used in arithmetic operations without proper bounds checking, there's a risk of integer overflow. Integer overflow occurs when a calculation results in a value that exceeds the maximum or minimum
