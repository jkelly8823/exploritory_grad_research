VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the line `zval **val;`.  This line declares a pointer to a pointer to a zval structure. Without proper bounds checking, an attacker could potentially provide a malicious input that overflows the allocated memory for the `val` pointer, leading to a buffer
