VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code calculates `out_len` and `(out_len * charsize)`. If `srclen` is large enough, these calculations can exceed the maximum value an `int` can hold, leading to an integer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a larger data type, such as `size_t`, to
