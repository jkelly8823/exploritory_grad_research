VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code calculates `out_len` and checks if it exceeds `INT_MAX` or is less than or equal to 0. However, it does not adequately protect against potential integer overflow in the calculation of `out_len`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a larger integer type, such as `long long`, to store
