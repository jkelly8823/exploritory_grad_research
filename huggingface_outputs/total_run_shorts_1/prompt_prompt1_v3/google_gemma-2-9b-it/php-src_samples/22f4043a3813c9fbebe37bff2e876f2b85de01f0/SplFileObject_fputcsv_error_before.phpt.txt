VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a Notice error
EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to call `fputcsv()` with an undefined variable `$fields`. This will likely result in a Notice error because PHP will try to access a variable that hasn't been defined.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Define the `$fields` variable before calling `fputcsv()`.
