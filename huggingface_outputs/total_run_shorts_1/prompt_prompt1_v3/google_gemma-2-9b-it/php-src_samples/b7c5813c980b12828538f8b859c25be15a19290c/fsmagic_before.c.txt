VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `file_printf(ms, "inode/%s", str)` function call lacks bounds checking on the `str` parameter. If `str` is longer than the buffer allocated for `inode/%s`, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
