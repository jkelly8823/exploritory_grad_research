VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `file_printf` function calls. Without knowing the exact implementation of `file_printf`, it's impossible to determine the exact size of the buffers it uses. However, if `file_printf` doesn't properly validate the input string lengths, it'
