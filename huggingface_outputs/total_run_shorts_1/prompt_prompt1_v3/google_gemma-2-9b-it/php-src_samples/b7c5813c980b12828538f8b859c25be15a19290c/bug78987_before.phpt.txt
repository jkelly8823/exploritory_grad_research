VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `str_repeat('0', $size)` function repeatedly concatenates the character '0' to create a string of length `$size`. If `$size` is larger than the allocated memory buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
