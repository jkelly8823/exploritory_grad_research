VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a directory traversal vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to open a magic database file using `finfo_open()`. The file path provided is constructed using string concatenation, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious input and potentially access files outside the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before constructing the file path.
