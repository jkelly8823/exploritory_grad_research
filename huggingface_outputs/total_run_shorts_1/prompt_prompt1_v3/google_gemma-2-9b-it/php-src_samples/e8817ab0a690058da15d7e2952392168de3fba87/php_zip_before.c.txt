VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `php_zip_make_relative_path` to construct a relative path.  Without knowing the implementation details of this function, there's a risk of a buffer overflow vulnerability. If `php_zip_make_relative_path` doesn't properly validate the input lengths or has insufficient buffer space
