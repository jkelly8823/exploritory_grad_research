VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability within the `while` loop. The loop iterates over a range of memory based on the value of `p` and `reg->dmin`. If `reg->dmin` is not properly validated, an attacker could manipulate its value to cause the loop to access
