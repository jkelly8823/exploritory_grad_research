VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11, 16, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains potential integer overflow vulnerabilities in the `scan_unsigned_octal_number` function.  The function reads an unsigned octal number from the input buffer. If the number is larger than 255, it will result in an integer overflow.
