VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3,4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates through the `keybuf` array, potentially writing more data than the buffer can hold. 
- Line 2: `q = (u_char *) keybuf;` initializes a pointer `q` to the beginning of
