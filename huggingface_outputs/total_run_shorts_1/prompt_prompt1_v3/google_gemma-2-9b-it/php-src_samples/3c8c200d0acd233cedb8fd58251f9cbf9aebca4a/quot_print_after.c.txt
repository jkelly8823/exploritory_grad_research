VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `safe_emalloc` function allocates memory for a buffer based on the provided length. However, the subsequent loop iterates through the input string (`str`) and writes characters to the buffer (`ret`). There is no explicit check to ensure that the number of characters written to the
