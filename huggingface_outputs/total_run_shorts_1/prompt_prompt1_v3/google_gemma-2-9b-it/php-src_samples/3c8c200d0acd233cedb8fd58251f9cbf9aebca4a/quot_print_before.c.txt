VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `safe_emalloc` function allocates memory for a buffer based on the `length` variable. However, the calculation of the buffer size does not adequately account for all possible input values. This can lead to a situation where the input string exceeds the allocated buffer size, overwriting
