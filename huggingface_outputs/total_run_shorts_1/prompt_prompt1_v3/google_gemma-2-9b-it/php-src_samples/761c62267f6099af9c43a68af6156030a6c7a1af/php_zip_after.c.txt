VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the length of `path_cleaned` is greater than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN`. However, it does not explicitly check if `path_cleaned` is null before accessing its length using `strlen(path_cleaned)`. If `path_cleaned` is null, `strlen(path_cleaned)`
