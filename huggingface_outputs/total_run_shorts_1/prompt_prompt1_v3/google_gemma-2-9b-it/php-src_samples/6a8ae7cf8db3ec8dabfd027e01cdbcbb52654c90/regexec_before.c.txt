VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `while` loop iterates over a pointer `p`, incrementing it based on the result of `enclen(reg->enc, p)`.  Without knowing the exact implementation of `enclen`, there's a risk that it could return a value that causes `p
