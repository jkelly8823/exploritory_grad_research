VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking on the `q` pointer.  The `while` loop iterates as long as `p` is less than `q`.  If `reg->dmin` is a large value, `q` could point beyond the allocated memory for `p`.  This could lead to a buffer overflow when
