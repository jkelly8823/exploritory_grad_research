VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet iterates through a list of named groups (`ng`) using a for loop. The loop variable `i` is used to index into the list. However, there is no check on the size of the list or the length of the `ng` pointer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the list is larger
