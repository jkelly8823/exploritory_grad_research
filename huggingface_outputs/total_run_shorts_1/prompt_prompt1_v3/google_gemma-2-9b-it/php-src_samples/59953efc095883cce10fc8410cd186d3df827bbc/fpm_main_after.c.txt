VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;` concatenates `script_path_translated` with `ptlen` without bounds checking. If `ptlen` is larger than the allocated memory for `script_path_translated`, it
