VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `safe_emalloc` function allocates memory for a buffer, but the calculation of the required buffer size (`length + (((3 * length)/(PHP_QPRINT_MAXL-9)) + 1)`) appears to be susceptible to integer overflow. If `length`
