VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;` directly calculates the size of `path_info` by adding `ptlen` to `script_path_translated`. If `ptlen` is larger than the allocated memory for `path_info`,
