VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The assignment of values to `*state` and `*type` without any bounds checking could lead to data overwriting beyond the allocated memory space. If the values assigned to these pointers are larger than the intended buffer size, it could result in a buffer overflow.
