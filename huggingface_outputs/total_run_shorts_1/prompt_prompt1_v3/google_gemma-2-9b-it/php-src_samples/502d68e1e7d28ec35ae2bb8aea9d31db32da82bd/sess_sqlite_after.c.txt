VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8,9,10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `sqlite_decode_binary` function is used to decode a binary string. However, the size of the allocated buffer (`*val`) is determined by the length of the function returns. If `sqlite_decode_binary` returns a value larger
