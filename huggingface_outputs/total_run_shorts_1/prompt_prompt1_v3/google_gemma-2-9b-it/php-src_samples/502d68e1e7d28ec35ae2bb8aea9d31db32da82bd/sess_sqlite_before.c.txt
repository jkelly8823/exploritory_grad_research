VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `sqlite_decode_binary` function is used to decode a binary string. However, the size of the allocated buffer (`*val`) is determined by `strlen(rowdata[0])`, which only considers the length of the raw binary data. 

Without proper bounds checking
