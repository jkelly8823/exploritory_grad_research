VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `snprintf` function constructs a path by concatenating `search_dir` (obtained from the environment variable `PATH`) with `sapi_module.executable_location`. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `PATH` environment variable to include malicious paths, leading to access
