VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares several character pointers (`tbuf`, `buf`, `p`, `tp`, `rp`, `c`, `lc`, `allow_free`) without specifying their sizes. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if these pointers are used to access memory beyond their allocated bounds.
