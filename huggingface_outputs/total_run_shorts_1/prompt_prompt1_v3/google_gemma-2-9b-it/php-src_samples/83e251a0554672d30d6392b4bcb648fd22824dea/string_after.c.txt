VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares several character pointers (`tbuf`, `buf`, `p`, `tp`, `rp`, `c`, `lc`) without specifying their sizes.  When these pointers are used to manipulate memory, there's a risk of a buffer overflow if the data written to them exceeds the allocated memory
