VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The `zend_parse_parameters` function expects three arguments (`base_arg`, `exp_arg`, `mod_arg`) which are likely to be integers. However, the function does not perform any bounds checking on these arguments. If the user provides excessively large integer values
