VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code declares several character pointers (`path`, `remove_path`, `add_path`) without specifying their sizes. This means that if these pointers are used to store data without proper bounds checking, it could lead to buffer overflows. A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space for a
