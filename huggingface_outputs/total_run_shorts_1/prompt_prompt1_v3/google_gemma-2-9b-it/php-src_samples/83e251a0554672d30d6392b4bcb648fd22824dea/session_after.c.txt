VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `php_win32_get_random_bytes` function is used to read random bytes into the `rbuf` buffer. However, the size of `rbuf` is fixed at 2048 bytes. If `entropy_length` is greater than
