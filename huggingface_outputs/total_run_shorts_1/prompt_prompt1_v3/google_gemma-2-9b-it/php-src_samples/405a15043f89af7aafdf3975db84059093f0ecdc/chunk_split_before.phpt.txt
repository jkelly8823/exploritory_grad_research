VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `str_repeat("B", 65535)` to create a string of 65535 "B" characters. This is a potentially dangerous operation as it can lead to a buffer overflow if the resulting string is larger than the allocated memory buffer.  Buffer overflows can be exploited by attackers
