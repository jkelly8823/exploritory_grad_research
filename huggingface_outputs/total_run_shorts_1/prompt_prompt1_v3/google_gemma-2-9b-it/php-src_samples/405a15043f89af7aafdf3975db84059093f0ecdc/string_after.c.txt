VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function copies data from `p` to `q` without checking if the destination buffer (`dest`) has enough space to accommodate the copied data. If `srclen` is larger than `out_len`, the `memcpy` operation will write beyond the allocated memory
