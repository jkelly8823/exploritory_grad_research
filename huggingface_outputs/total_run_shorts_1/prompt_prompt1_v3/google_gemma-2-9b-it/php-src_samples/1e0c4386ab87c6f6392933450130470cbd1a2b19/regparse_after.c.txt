VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if a value `*vs` is greater than 0xff (255). If it is, it returns ONIGERR_INVALID_CODE_POINT_VALUE. This check is insufficient to prevent an integer overflow. If `*vs` is a large enough value, it could potentially overflow the `
