VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The lines in question involve the calculation of `to_add_len` and the subsequent use of this value in string operations. If `ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8` returns a value larger than the allocated memory for `to_add`, an
