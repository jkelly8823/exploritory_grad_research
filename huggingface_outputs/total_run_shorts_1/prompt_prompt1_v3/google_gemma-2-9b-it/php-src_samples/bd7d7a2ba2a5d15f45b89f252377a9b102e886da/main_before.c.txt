VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `php_strtok_r` function is used to parse the `PATH` environment variable, and the resulting directories are concatenated with the `sapi_module.executable_location` to form a full path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the
