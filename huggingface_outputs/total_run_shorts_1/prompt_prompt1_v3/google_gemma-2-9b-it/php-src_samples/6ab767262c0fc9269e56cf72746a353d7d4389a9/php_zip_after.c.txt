VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when copying the comment data into the return string. `zip_get_archive_comment` is assumed to return a valid pointer and a valid comment length. However, if `zip_get_archive_comment` returns a malformed or unexpected comment length, it could lead to a buffer overflow.
