VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `for` loop iterates through a string (`p`) and copies characters into a destination buffer (`to->s`). The loop condition `i + len >= OPT_EXACT_MAXLEN` checks if the current write position (`i`) plus the length of the current character sequence
