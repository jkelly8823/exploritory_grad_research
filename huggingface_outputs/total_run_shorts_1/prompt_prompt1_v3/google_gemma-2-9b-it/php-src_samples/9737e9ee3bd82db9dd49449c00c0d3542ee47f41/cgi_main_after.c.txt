VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `emalloc` function allocates memory for `path_translated` based on the calculated `path_translated_len`. However, the `memcpy` function copies data from `pt` to `path_translated` without bounds checking. If the length of `pt` exceeds the
