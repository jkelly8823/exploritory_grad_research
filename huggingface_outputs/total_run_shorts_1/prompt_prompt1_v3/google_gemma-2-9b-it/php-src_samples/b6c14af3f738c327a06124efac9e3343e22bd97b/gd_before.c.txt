VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the input pointer `src` is NULL. If it is, the function returns 0. However, there is no check for the size of the input data pointed to by `src`. If `src` points to a buffer that is too large, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
