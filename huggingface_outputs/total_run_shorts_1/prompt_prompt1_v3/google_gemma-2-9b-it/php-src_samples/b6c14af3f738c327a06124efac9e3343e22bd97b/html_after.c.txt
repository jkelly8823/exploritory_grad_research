VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: NULL Pointer Dereference
EXPLANATION:
The code initializes several pointers (`to_uni_table`, `inv_map`, `replacement`) to `NULL`.  Later in the code, these pointers are used without checks to ensure they are not `NULL`. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing a crash or unexpected behavior.
