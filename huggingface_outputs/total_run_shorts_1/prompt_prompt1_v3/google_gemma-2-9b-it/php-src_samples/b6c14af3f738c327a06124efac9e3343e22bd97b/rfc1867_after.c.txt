VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 29-39
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `total_bytes` is compared against `LONG_MAX` to check for potential overflow. If `total_bytes` exceeds `LONG_MAX`, the code attempts to convert it to a string using `snprintf`. However, the `snprintf` function does
