VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any immediately apparent vulnerabilities. It appears to be setting up variables for cryptographic operations (MD5 and SHA1 hashing). 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
While not a vulnerability, consider using more modern and secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead of MD5, which is known
