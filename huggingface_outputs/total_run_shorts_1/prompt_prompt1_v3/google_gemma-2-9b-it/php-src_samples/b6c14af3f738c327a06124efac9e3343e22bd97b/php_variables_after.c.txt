VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `char *p = NULL;` declares a character pointer `p`. However, there is no explicit size check or bounds validation when assigning values to `p`. If a malicious actor provides a string longer than the allocated memory for `p`, it could overwrite adjacent memory locations,
