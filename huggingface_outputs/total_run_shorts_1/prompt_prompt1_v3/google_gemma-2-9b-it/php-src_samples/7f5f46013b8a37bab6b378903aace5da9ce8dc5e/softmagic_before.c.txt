VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `for` loop starting at line 18. The loop iterates through the input buffer `buf` searching for newline characters (`\n`). The loop condition `b < end` checks if the current pointer `b` is less than the `end` pointer, which
