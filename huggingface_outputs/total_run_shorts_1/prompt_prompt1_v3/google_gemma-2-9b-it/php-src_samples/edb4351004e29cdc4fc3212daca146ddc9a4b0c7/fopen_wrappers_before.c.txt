VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `strncmp` function compares the `resolved_basedir` and `resolved_name` strings. If `resolved_basedir` starts with `resolved_name`, the code assumes the file is in the correct directory.
