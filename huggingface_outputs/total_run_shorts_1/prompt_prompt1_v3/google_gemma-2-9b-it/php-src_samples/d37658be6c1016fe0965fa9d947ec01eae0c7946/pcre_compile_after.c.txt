VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The loop iterates through `cd->named_groups` without bounds checking. If `cd->names_found` is larger than the allocated size of `cd->named_groups`, the loop will access memory beyond the allocated bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.
