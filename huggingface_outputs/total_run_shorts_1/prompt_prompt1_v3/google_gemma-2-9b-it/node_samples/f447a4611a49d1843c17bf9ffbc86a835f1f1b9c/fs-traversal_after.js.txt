VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability. The variables `traversalPath`, `traversalFolderPath`, and `bufferTraversalPath` are constructed using string concatenation with `../` which can be exploited to access files and directories outside the intended scope.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before constructing file paths.
