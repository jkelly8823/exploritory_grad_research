VULNERABILITY: YES
VULNERABILITY_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Input Validation
EXPLANATION: The code directly writes user-supplied data (`${pem}`) to a file without any validation or sanitization. This could lead to a command injection vulnerability if the `pem` variable contains malicious code. An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands into the file, allowing them to execute malicious code on the system.
