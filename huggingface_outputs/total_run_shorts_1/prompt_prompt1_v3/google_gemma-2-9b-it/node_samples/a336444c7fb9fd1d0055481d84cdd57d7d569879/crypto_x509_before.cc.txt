VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP` macro attempts to assign a value to the `cert` pointer. However, if the assignment fails, the `cert` pointer might remain uninitialized. Subsequently, the code attempts to access `cert
