VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code is vulnerable to a potential injection attack due to the use of user-supplied data in the construction of certificate subject fields.
EXPLANATION:
The code directly embeds user-supplied data from the `subjects` array into the certificate's subject fields. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious data into the certificate, which could be used for various attacks, such as impersonation or certificate forgery.
