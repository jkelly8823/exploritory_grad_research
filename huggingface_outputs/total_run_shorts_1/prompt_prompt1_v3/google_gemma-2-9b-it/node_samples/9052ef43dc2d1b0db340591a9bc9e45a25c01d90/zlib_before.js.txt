VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `write` function call. The `this.write` function appears to be responsible for writing data to an output buffer (`self._outBuffer`). 

The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking when determining the amount of data to write (`self._chunkSize`). If
