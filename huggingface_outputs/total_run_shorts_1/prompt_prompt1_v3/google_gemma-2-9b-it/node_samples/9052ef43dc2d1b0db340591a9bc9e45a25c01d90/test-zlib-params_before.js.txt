VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the `deflater.write()` and `deflater.read()` methods without proper bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input data (`chunk1`) is larger than the allocated buffer size. The `while (def
