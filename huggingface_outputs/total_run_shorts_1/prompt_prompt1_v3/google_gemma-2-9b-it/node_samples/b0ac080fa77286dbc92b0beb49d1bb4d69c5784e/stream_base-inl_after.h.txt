VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19,20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a function call to `DoWrite` which takes a buffer (`bufs`) and a count (`count`) as arguments. If the buffer is not properly sized or validated, a malicious actor could provide a buffer larger than the allocated space, leading to a buffer overflow.
