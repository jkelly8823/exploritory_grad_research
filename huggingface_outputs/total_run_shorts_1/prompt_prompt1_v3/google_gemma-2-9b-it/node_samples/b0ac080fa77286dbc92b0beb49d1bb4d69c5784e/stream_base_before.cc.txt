VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks for an error condition (`err != 0`) and a count of zero (`count == 0`). If either condition is true, it sets a `StreamWriteResult` and returns the error code. However, the code does not explicitly handle potential integer overflows in the `err` variable. If `err`
