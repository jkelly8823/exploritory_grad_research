VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regular expression injection vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses a regular expression `R"(\.([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\s*[\.\s]*$)" ` to extract the file extension.  An attacker could potentially craft a filename that contains malicious regular expression patterns within the extension, leading to unintended behavior or code execution.
