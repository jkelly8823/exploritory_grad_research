VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strrchr` function searches for the last occurrence of a character within a string. If the input `filename` is maliciously crafted to be longer than the allocated buffer, `strrchr` could potentially write beyond the bounds of the buffer, leading to
