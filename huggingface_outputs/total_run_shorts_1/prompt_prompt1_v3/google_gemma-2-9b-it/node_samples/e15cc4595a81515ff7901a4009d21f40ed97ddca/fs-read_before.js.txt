VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile)` which suggests it constructs a file path by concatenating a potentially user-controlled `blockedFile` with a namespace. This can lead to a path traversal vulnerability if `blockedFile` is maliciously crafted to include ".." sequences, allowing an attacker to access files
