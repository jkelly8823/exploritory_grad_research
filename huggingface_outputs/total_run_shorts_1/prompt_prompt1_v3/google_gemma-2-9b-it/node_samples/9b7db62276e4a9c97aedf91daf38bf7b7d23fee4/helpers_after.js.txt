VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype Pollution Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential Prototype Pollution vulnerability. In the `else` block, a new `require` function is defined. This function directly calls `mod.require(path)`, which suggests that `mod` is an object with a `require` method.

Prototype Pollution occurs when an attacker can manipulate the prototype chain
