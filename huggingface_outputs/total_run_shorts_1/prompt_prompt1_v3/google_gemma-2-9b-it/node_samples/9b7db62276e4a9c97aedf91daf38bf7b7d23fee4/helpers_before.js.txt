VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION: The code snippet demonstrates a dynamic modification of the `require` function. This allows for potential manipulation of the module loading process. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `mod` object or the `require_private_symbol` function, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities
