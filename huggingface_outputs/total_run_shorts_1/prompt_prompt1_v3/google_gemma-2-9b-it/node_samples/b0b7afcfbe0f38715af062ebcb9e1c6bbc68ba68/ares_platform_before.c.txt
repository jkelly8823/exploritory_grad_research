VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memset` function is used to initialize the `OsvEx` structure. However, the code does not explicitly check the size of the buffer before writing data to it. If the size of the `OsvEx
