VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)
EXPLANATION:
The code sends a request to a non-routable IP address (0.0.0.0). This could potentially lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition if the server is not properly configured to handle such requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate the IP address before sending the request.
