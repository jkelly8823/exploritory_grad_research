VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the calculation of the `length` variable, which determines the size of the buffer allocated for a header. The `length` variable is calculated as `name_len + value_len + 32`. If the `name_len` and `value_len` are larger than expected, the
