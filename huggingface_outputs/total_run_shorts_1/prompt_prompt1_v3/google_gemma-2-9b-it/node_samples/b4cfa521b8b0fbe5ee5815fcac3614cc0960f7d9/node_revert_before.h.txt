EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines a macro `SECURITY_REVERSIONS` which is intended to list known vulnerabilities and their descriptions. While the code itself does not contain any direct vulnerabilities, the comment "// TODO(addaleax): Remove all of the above before Node.js 13" suggests that the macro might be outdated and should be removed in future versions
