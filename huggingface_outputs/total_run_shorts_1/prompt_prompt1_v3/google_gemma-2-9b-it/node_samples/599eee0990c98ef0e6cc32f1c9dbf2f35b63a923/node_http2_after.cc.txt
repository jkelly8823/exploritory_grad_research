VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19,20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Lines 19 and 20 involve the `Write(&stream_buf_, 1)` function call. Without knowing the exact implementation of the `Write` function, it's impossible to definitively say if a buffer overflow occurs. However, if the `Write
