VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype Pollution
EXPLANATION:
The line `CompileRun("for (var i = 0; i < 128; i++) Object.prototype[i] = 0;");` is vulnerable to prototype pollution. This attack allows an attacker to add new properties to the `Object.prototype` object, which can then be inherited by all instances of objects
