VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential command injection vulnerability. In the `create` method, the `args` array is dynamically populated based on user-supplied `options`. Specifically, the `options.headers` object could contain malicious input that, when concatenated with the other arguments, could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands.
