VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential command injection vulnerability. The `CopyJsStringArray` function is responsible for copying JavaScript arguments into a buffer (`args_buffer_`).  Without proper sanitization or escaping of these arguments, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the `args_buffer_`, which would then be executed by the `
