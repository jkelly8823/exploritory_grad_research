VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability.  The `resolved_param` variable is constructed using `node::PathResolve(env, {param})`, which likely resolves the input `param` to a file path.  

The code then checks for a UNC path (`\\\\`) and if found,
