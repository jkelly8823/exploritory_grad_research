VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `node::PathResolve` function is used to resolve the input parameter `param`. However, the subsequent string manipulation within the `#ifdef _WIN32` block does not adequately sanitize the resolved path.

Specifically, the code removes leading characters like "\\
