VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability

The use of `/*` within the `pathname`, `path`, and `href` attributes of an object suggests that these values are intended to be dynamically constructed.  If these values are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially manipulate them to access files or directories
