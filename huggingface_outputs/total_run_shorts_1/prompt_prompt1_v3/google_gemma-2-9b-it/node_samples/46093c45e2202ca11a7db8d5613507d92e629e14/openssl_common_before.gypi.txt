VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The variable `ENGINESDIR` is being directly assigned the value  `/dev/null`. While this might seem harmless, it opens the door to potential command injection vulnerabilities if this variable is later used in a system command. An attacker could potentially manipulate the value of `ENGINESDIR` to include malicious commands.
