VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `str->Write(dst, 0, max_chars, flags)` function call writes data to the `dst` buffer without explicitly checking if the data size exceeds the buffer's capacity. If the `str->Write` function writes more data than `max_chars`
