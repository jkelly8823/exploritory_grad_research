VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `str->Write(dst, 0, max_chars, flags)` function call writes data to the `dst` buffer. However, the `max_chars` variable, calculated as `buflen / sizeof(*dst)`, does not account for potential null termination of the
