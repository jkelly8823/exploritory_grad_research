VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the string size is less than or equal to the remaining storage size. However, it does not check if the string size is less than or equal to the available storage size after the offset is applied. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the string size is larger than the remaining storage size after the offset.
