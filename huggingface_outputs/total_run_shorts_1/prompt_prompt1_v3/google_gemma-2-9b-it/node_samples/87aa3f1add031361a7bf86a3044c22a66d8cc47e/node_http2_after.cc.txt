VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks context regarding the size of the `frame->hd.length` variable and the buffer it's used to access. If `frame->hd.length` is larger than the allocated buffer size, a buffer overflow vulnerability could occur. This could allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution
