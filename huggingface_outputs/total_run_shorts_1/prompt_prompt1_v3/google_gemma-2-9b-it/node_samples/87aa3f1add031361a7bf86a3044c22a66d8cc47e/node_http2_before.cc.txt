VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if a frame's length is 0 and considers it an error. However, there's no explicit check for the size of the `frame->hd.length` variable. If `frame->hd.length` is larger than the allocated buffer, a buffer overflow could occur when accessing `frame->hd
