VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure HTTP Parser Usage
EXPLANATION:
The code sets `insecureHTTPParser: true` when making an HTTP request. This disables certificate validation, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and other security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the `insecureHTTPParser: true` option.
- Implement proper certificate validation mechanisms.
