VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The code snippet demonstrates attempts to modify file permissions (chmod) and ownership (chown) on a file that is opened in read-only mode. The assertions are correctly verifying that these operations should result in an "ERR_ACCESS_DENIED" error, as expected for a read-only file descriptor.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
