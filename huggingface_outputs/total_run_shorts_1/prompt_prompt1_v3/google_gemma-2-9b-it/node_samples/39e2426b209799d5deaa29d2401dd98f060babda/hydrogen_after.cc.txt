VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `int32_t value = constant->Integer32Value() * sign;`  could lead to an integer overflow. If `constant->Integer32Value()` is a large number and `sign` is either 1 or -1, the multiplication could result in a value that exceeds the maximum or minimum value
