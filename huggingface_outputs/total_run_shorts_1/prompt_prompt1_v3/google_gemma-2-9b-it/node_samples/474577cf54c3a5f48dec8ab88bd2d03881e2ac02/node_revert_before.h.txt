VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be defining a namespace and an enum. There are no immediately apparent vulnerabilities. The use of macros like `SECURITY_REVERSIONS` and `V` suggests a mechanism for defining security-related revisions, but without further context, it's impossible to determine if there are any inherent vulnerabilities in this approach.
