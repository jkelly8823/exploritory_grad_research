VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code performs a check `assert(list.length <= kMaxModuleCount, ...)` to ensure the length of the `list` array does not exceed `kMaxModuleCount`. However, there is a potential for integer overflow if `list.length` is very large and `kMaxModuleCount` is not sufficiently large to
