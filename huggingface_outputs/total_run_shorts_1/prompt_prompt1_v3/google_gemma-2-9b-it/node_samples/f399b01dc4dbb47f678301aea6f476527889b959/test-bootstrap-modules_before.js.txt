VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `assert` statement checks if the length of the `list` array is less than or equal to `kMaxModuleCount`. If the condition is not met, it logs an error message that includes the entire contents of the `list` array. If `list` contains sensitive information, this could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability
