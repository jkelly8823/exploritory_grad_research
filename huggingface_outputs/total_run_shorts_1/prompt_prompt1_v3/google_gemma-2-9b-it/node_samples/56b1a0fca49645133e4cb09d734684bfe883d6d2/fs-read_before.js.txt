EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to rename a file (`blockedFile`) to a new name (`newfile`). However, there's no guarantee that the file will be successfully renamed before the callback function is executed. If another process or thread modifies the file in the meantime, it could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.
