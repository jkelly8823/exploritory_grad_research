VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `SSL_CIPHER_get_name(c)` function call. If the name of the SSL cipher is longer than the allocated buffer, it could lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the buffer used to store the SSL cipher name is large enough to accommodate the maximum possible length.
