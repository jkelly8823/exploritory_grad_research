VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of RAND_bytes_ex with a non-zero entropy source
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes RAND_bytes_ex to generate random data for an initialization vector (IV). However, it passes a non-zero entropy source (`ossl_cms_ctx_get0_libctx(cms_ctx)`), which is a potential vulnerability.
