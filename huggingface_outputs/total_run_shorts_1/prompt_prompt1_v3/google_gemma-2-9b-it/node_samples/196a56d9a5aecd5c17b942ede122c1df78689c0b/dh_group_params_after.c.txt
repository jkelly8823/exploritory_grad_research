VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `dh->dirty_cnt++;` increments a counter without bounds checking. If `dh->dirty_cnt` reaches its maximum value, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement bounds checking on `dh->dirty_cnt`
