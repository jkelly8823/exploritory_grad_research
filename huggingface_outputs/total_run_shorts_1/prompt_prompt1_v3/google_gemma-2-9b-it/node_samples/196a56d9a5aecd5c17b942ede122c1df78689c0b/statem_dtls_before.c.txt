VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 41, 42
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The variable `s->init_num` is used to track the cumulative length of received fragments. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that `s->init_num` does not exceed the capacity of the buffer `s->init_buf->data
