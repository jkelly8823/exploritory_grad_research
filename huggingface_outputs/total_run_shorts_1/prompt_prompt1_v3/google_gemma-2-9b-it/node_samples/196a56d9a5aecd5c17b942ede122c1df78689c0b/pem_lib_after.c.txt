VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the use of `BIO_gets` without proper bounds checking. 
`BIO_gets` reads a line from a BIO object, but it doesn't inherently limit the length of the read line. If a malicious input provides a
