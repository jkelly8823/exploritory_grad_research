VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Random Number Generation
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes `RAND_bytes_ex` to generate a random initialization vector (IV). However, the `RAND_bytes_ex` function relies on the quality of the underlying random number generator (RNG). If the RNG is not properly seeded or compromised, it can produce predictable or weak random numbers,
