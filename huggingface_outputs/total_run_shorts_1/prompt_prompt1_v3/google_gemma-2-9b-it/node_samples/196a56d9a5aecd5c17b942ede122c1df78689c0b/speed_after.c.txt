VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `size_t outlen = MAX_FFDH_SIZE;` initializes a variable `outlen` with a fixed value `MAX_FFDH_SIZE`. However, the subsequent call to `EVP_PKEY_derive(ffdh_ctx, derived_
