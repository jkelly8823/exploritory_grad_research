VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 29-34
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper use of a sequence number to ensure uniqueness of nonces.
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to generate unique nonces by combining a timestamp, process ID, thread ID, and a sequence number. However, the sequence number is incremented only when the timestamp is the same as the previous nonce. This can lead to a vulnerability if
