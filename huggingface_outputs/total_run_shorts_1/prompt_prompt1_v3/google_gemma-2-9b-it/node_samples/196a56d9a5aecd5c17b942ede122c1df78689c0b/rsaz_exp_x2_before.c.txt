VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18, 21, 24
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in two instances. Lines 18 and 21 involve casting pointers to `uint64_t` and then performing arithmetic operations on them. This can lead to accessing memory beyond the allocated bounds of the `in_str` and `out
