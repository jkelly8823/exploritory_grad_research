VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the length of the initialization vector (IV) for CBC mode encryption. However, the check for `eivlen <= 1` and setting `eivlen = 0` might lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the IV length is not correctly handled in subsequent code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure
