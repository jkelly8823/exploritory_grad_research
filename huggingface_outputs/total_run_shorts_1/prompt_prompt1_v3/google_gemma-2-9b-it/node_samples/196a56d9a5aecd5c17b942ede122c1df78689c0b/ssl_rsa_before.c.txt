VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 49-52
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `OPENSSL_realloc` function is used to dynamically allocate memory for the `serverinfo` buffer. However, the calculation of the new buffer size (`serverinfo_length + extension_length + contextoff`) does not adequately account for potential overflows. If the
