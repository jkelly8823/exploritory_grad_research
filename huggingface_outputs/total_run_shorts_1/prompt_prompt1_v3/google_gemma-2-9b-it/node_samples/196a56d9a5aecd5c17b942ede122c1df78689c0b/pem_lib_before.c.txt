VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `BIO_write` function writes data to a BIO object, which is a stream-like structure. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking on the input data written to the BIO object. If the input data exceeds the allocated buffer size, it can
