VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for buffer overflow vulnerability in `EVP_PKEY_print_params`.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet calls `EVP_PKEY_print_params` without specifying a maximum output length. This function prints the parameters of a public key to a BIO object. If the parameters are large, the function could write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
