VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `int id0 = (int)(id >> 24);` and `int id1 = (int)((id >> 16) & 0xffL);`  perform bitwise right shifts on the `id`
