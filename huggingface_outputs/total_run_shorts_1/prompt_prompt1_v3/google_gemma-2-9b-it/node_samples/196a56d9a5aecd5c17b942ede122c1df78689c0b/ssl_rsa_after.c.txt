VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `extension_append` function appends an extension to a `serverinfo` buffer. The calculation of the `contextoff` value and the subsequent copying of the extension data into the `serverinfo` buffer do not adequately account for potential buffer overflows. If
