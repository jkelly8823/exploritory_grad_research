VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Initialization of Initialization Vector (IV)
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the cipher mode and attempts to determine the IV length. However, it sets `eivlen` to 0 if the IV length is less than or equal to 1. This can lead to an improper initialization of the IV, potentially resulting in a vulnerability like a weakened encryption
