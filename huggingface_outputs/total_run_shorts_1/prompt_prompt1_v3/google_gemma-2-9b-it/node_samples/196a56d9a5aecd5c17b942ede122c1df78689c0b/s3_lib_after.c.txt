VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when accessing `sk_SSL_CIPHER_value(allow, ii)`.  If `ii` is out of bounds for the `allow` array, this could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking before accessing `sk_
