VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `s->init_num` is used to accumulate the lengths of fragments. If the sum of fragment lengths exceeds the maximum value that `s->init_num` can hold, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected
