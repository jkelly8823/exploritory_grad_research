VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `BIO_read(in, linebuf, MAX_SMLEN)` function reads data from the input BIO (`in`) into the `linebuf` buffer. If the input data exceeds the size of `linebuf`, a buffer overflow will occur.
