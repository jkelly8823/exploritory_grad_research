VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 30
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `len = buf[aad_len - 2] << 8 | buf[aad_len - 1];` attempts to read two bytes from the `buf` array to calculate the length of the data. However, if `aad_
