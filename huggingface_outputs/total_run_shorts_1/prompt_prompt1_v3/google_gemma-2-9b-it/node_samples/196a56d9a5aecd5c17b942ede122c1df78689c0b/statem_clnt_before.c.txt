EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be performing a check for compatibility between a client's requested cipher suite and the server's selected cipher suite in the context of TLS/SSL. It handles the specific case of TLSv1.3 where a different cipher suite can be chosen as long as the hash algorithm remains the same.
