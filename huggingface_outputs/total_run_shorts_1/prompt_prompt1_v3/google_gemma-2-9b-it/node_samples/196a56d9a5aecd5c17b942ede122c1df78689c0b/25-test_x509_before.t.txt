VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `run()` function to execute a command constructed by concatenating strings. The `-dateopt` argument is taken directly from user input (or a file path in this case) and is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the command line.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer alternative
