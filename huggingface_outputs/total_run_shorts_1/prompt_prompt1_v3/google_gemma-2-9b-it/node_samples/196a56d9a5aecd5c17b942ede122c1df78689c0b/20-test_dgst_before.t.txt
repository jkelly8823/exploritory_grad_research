VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive data exposure
EXPLANATION: The code snippet reveals the use of variables `$xofdata[1]` and `$expected` without proper context or sanitization. These variables likely hold sensitive data, such as cryptographic digests or expected values. Exposing these variables directly in error messages can lead to information leakage, potentially compromising the security of the system.
