VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks the length of the initialization vector (IV) used in the encryption process. If the IV length is less than or equal to 1, it sets the IV length to 0. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the application uses a fixed-size buffer to store the IV and the
