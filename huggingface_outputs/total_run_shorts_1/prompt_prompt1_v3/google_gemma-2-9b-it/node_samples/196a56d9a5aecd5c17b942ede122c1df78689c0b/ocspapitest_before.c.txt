VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates the potential for an integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the line `ASN1_INTEGER_set_uint64(serial, (uint64_t)1)` sets the value of the `serial` integer to 1. While this might seem harmless, the issue arises if
