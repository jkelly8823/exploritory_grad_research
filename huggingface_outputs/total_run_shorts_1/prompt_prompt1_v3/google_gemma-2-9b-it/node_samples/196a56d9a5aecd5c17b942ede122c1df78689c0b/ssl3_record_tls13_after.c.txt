VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the length of the initialization vector (IV) is less than 0. If it is, it triggers an error and returns 0. However, the code does not handle the case where the IV length is greater than the maximum allowed size. This could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability.
