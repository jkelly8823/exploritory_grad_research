VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet stores cryptographic keys (`Ctrl`, `SharedSecret`) in plain text. This is a severe vulnerability as these keys can be easily compromised if the code is accessed or the storage is not properly secured.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Store cryptographic keys securely using a dedicated key management system.
- Avoid hardcoding keys directly
