VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the required memory size `n` for a buffer using the formula `(len+3)/3*4`. This formula is vulnerable to integer overflow if `len` is a very large number.  Overflow can occur if `len` is large enough to cause the result of `(len+3)/3` to exceed the maximum value that can be stored in
