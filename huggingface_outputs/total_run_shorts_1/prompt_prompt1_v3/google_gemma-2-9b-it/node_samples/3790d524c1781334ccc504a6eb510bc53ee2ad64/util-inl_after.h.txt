VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The `strrchr` function searches for the last occurrence of a character in a string. If the `filename` string is longer than the allocated buffer, `strrchr` could potentially write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.
