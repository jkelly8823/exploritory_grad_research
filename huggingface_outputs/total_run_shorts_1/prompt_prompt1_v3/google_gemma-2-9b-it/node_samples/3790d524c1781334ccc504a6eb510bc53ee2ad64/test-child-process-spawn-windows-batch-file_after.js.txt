VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)

If an attacker can control the value of `filename`, they could potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by providing a malicious filename that triggers an error or resource exhaustion
