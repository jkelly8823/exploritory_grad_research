VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The lines `k := scalar + 2*cardinality` are vulnerable to integer overflow.  This operation adds the value of `cardinality` twice to the value of `scalar`. If `scalar` and `cardinality` are large enough, the result could exceed the maximum value that can be stored in
