VULNERABLE_LINES: Line 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `k := scalar + 2*cardinality` is vulnerable to integer overflow.  Without knowing the sizes of `scalar` and `cardinality`, it's impossible to determine if the result of this addition will fit within the allocated memory for `k`. If the sum exceeds the maximum value representable by the
