VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `i` in the loop iterates from 0 to 1999, and it's used to create keys in the `headers` object.  The `headers[`key${i}`]` assignment could lead to an integer overflow if the value of `i` exceeds the maximum allowed size for a
