VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable `i` in the loop iterates from 0 to 1999 (N-1).  The line `headers[`key${i}`] = i;` assigns the value of `i` to a header field.
