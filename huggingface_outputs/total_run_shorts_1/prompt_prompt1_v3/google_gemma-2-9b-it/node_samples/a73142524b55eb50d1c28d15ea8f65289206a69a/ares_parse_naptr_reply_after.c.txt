VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks bounds checking when processing the `rr_len` variable. If `rr_len` is larger than the allocated buffer size, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that `
