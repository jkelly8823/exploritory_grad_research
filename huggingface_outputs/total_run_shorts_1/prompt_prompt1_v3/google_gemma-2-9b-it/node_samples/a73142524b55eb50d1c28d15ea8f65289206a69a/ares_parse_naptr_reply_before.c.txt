VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet lacks context regarding the size and content of the `rr_class` and `rr_type` variables.  If these variables are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could potentially provide malformed input that overflows a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate Input:**
