VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for infinite recursion
EXPLANATION:
The code contains nested `if` statements with a potential for infinite recursion. If `rv` is not 0 within the first `if` block, it returns `rv`. However, the subsequent `if` block checks for `rv != 0` again, potentially leading to an infinite loop if
