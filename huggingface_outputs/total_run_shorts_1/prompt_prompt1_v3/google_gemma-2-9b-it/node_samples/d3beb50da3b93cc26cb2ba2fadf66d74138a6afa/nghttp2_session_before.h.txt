VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet declares a `uint32_t` variable named `next_stream_id`.  The comment states that it is made unsigned to detect values greater than or equal to (1 << 31). This indicates a potential for integer overflow. If `next_stream_id` is incremented beyond the maximum value representable by a `uint32_t
