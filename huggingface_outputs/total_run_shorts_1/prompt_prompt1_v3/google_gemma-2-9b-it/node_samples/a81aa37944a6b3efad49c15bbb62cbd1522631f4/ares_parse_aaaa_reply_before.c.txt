VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if `naddrttls` is not null. If it's not null, it assigns the value of `naddrs` to the memory location pointed to by `naddrttls`.  Without knowing the size of `naddrttls`, there's a risk of a buffer overflow.
