VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for infinite loop
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet contains a `while` loop that continues to execute as long as the `done` variable is false. However, there is no apparent mechanism for setting `done` to true within the loop. This could lead to an infinite loop if the condition `!done` remains true indefinitely
