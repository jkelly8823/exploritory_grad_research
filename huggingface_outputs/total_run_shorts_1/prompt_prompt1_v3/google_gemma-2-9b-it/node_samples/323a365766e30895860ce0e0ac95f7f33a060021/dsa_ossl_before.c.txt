VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided shows a loop that continues as long as the value of `k` is zero. While this loop itself doesn't appear to be vulnerable, the potential for integer overflow lies in the `BN_is_zero(k)` function.  

The `BN_is_zero()` function is likely used
