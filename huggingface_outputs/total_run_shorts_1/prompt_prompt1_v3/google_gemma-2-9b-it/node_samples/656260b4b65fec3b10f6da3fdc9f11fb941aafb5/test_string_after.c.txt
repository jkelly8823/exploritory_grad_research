VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `TestMemoryCorruption` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The code reads a string from the `args[0]` argument and copies it into the `buf` buffer, which has a fixed size of 10 bytes. If the input string is longer than 10 bytes, it will overflow the buffer, potentially
