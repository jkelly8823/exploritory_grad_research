VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of memmove() function without checking the length of the source and destination buffers.
EXPLANATION:
The memmove() function copies a block of memory from the source buffer to the destination buffer until the null terminator is reached. If the source or destination buffer is not large enough, it can lead to buffer overflow, which
