VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of memmove() function without checking the length of the source and destination buffers.
EXPLANATION: The memmove() function copies a specified number of bytes from a source string to a destination buffer without checking the length of the source and destination buffers, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source or destination buffer is larger than the available
