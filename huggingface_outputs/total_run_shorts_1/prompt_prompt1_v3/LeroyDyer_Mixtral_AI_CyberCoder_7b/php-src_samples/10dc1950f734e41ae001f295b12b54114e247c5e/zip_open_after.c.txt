VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The code snippet checks if the offset plus the size is greater than the end of the buffer, but it does not check if the size is within the bounds of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the size is larger than the buffer size.
