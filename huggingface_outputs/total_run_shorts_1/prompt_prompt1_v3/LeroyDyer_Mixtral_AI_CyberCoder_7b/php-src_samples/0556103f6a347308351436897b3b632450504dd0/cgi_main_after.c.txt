VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strdup() function without checking the size of the decoded_query_string variable.
EXPLANATION: The strdup() function does not check the size of the string to be duplicated, so it can lead to buffer overflow if the input string is too long.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use strndup
