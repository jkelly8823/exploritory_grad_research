VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of atoi() function which can lead to integer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The use of atoi() function to convert a string to an integer without bounds checking can lead to integer overflows, which can result in buffer overflows. This can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the buffer boundary
