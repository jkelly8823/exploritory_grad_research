VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflows vulnerability in the for loop. The variable 'j' is incremented without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of 'j' is larger than the size of the array 'ssa->cfg.blocks[p->block].predecessors_count'. This could result in memory corruption and a potential security vulnerability.
