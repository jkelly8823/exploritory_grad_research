VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the BIO_get_mem_ptr() function which does not check the length of the output buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_get_mem_ptr() function does not check the length of the output buffer, which can result in a buffer overflow if the output is
