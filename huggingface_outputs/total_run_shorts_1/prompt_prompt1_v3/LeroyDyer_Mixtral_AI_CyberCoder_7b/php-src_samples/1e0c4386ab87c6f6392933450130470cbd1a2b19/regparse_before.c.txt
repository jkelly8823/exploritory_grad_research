VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the scan_unsigned_octal_number function. The function is called twice without bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The function call to scan_unsigned_octal_number is made twice without bounds checking, which could lead to integer overflows and buffer overflows. This could potentially be
