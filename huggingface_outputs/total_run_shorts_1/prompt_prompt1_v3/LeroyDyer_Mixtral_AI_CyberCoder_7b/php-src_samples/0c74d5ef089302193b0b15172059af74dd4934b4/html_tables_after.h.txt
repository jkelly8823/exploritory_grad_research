VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array without bounds checking. The variable "multi_cp_html5_02AFD" is not initialized and has a size of 13 bytes, but the data being assigned to it has a size of 16 bytes. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
