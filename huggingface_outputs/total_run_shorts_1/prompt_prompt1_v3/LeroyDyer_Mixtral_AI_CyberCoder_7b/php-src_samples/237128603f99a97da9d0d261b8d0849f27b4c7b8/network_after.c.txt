VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code uses a non-thread-safe function call to gethostbyname() which can lead to race conditions and potential security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a thread-safe alternative such as getaddrinfo() or implement a mutex lock to protect the call to gethostbyname().
