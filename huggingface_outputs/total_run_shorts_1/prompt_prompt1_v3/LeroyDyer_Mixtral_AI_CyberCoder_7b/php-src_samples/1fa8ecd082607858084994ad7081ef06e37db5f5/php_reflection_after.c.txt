VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the zval_copy_ctor function, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the zval_copy_ctor function to copy the value of a constant variable into a new zval structure, which can lead to buffer overflow if the size of the structure is
