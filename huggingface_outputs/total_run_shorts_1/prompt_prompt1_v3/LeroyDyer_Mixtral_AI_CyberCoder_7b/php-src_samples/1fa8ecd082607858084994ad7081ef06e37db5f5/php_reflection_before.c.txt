VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the Z_TYPE_P macro, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The Z_TYPE_P macro is used to check if a Zval is a constant or a constant array, but it does not properly handle null values. This can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption if
