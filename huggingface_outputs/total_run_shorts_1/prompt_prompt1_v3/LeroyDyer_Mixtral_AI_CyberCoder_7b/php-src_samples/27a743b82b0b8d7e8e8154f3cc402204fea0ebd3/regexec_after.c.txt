VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the line: 
```
if (reg->dmax != ONIG_INFINITE_DISTANCE) {
```
This is because the variable `reg->dmax` is compared to a constant value `ONIG_INFINITE_DISTANCE` which is not defined, and the comparison operator `
