VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to the function `strcpy()` in the line 10. The function `strcpy()` is used to copy a string from a source string to a destination buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.
