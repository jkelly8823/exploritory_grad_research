VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a non-bounded buffer. The BufferReader's readLine() method does not have a limit on the number of characters it reads, so it can potentially read in more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
