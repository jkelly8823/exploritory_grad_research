VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation to access memory locations beyond the bounds of the allocated memory. The pointer p is incremented by 1 to access the next character in the string, but the size of the string is not checked. This can lead to memory corruption and
