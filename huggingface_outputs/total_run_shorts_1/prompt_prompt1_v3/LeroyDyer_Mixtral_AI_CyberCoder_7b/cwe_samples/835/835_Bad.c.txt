VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `connect` function without bounds checking. The `connect` function does not check the size of the input parameters, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION: The `connect` function does not check the size of the input parameters, which could allow an attacker to pass a larger value than the expected size
