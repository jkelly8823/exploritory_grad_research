VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the EVP_DigestFinal function which does not check the length of the output buffer. The function call EVP_DigestFinal(&ctx,ret,olen) does not check the size of the output buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the output length is larger than the size of the buffer.
