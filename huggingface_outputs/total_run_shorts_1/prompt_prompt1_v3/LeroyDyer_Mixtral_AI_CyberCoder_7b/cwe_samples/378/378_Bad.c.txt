VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the system function tmpfile() which does not check the size of the returned file descriptor. This can lead to potential memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The tmpfile() function returns a file descriptor to a temporary file, but it does not check the size of the file, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if
