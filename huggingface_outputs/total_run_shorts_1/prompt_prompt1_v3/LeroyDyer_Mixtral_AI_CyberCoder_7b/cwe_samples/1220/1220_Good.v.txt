VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size array without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a fixed-size array without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The use of a fixed-size array without bounds checking can allow an attacker to write beyond the array's bounds, potentially leading to memory corruption and data leakage
