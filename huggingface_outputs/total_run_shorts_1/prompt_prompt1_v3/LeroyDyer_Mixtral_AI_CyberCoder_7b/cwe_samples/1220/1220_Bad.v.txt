VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the assignment statement. The use of the logical OR operator (||) in the assignment statement can lead to unexpected behavior if the values of access_ctrl_i[i][j] and priv_lvl_i are not properly checked. This could result in unintended values being assigned to connectivity_map_o[i][j
