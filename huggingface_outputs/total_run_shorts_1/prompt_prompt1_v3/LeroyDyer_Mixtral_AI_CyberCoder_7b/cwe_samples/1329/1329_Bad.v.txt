VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The function hmac() uses a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a dynamic buffer allocation or implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks.

VULNERABLE: NO
