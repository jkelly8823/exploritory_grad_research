VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential vulnerability in the use of the 'always' statement. The 'always' statement is used to specify a block of code that is executed continuously, but it is not recommended to use it for control flow logic. Instead, it is recommended to use 'initial' or 'initial' for initialization and 'always_comb' or 'always_ff' for combinational logic.
