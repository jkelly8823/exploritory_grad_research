VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a try-catch block without a finally block, which can lead to resource leaks and memory leaks.
EXPLANATION: The try-catch block is missing a finally block, which can result in resource leaks and memory leaks. The finally block should be used to ensure that resources are properly closed and cleaned up, even if an exception is thrown.
