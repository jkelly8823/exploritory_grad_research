VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of the ECB mode is considered insecure as it is vulnerable to cryptographic attacks such as the BEAST attack. The ECB mode is not recommended for encryption due to its block cipher block cipher vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The ECB mode is vulnerable to BEAST attacks due to its predictable block cipher behavior. The CBC mode is recommended for encryption.
