VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a NoSuchAlgorithmException and NoSuchPaddingException. The code does not handle these exceptions properly.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to instantiate an RSA cipher using the "RSA/NONE/NoPadding" algorithm, which is not a valid algorithm. If the algorithm is not available, a NoSuchAlgorithmException will be thrown. The
