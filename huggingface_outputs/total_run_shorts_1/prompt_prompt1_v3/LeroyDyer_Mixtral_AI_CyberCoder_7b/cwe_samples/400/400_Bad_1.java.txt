VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a shared resource (serverSocket) in a multi-threaded environment. The serverSocket is not synchronized, which can lead to data races and unpredictable behavior.
EXPLANATION: The serverSocket is not synchronized, which means that multiple threads can access it concurrently, potentially leading to data races and unpredictable behavior
