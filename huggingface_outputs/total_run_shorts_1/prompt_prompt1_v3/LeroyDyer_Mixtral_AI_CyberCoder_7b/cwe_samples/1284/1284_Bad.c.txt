VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the use of the scanf function without bounds checking. The scanf function does not check the size of the input against the size of the buffer, allowing a potential attacker to pass a larger value than the size of the buffer, which can lead to memory corruption and program crashes.

EXPLANATION: The code uses the scanf function
