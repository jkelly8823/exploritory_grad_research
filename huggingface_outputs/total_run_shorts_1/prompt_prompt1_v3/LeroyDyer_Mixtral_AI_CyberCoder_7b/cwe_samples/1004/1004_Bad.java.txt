VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to session fixation attacks because it does not include a random session ID generation method. The session ID is hardcoded.
EXPLANATION: The session ID is hardcoded, which makes it predictable and can be easily guessed by attackers.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a random session ID generation method such as a cryptographically secure random number generator.
