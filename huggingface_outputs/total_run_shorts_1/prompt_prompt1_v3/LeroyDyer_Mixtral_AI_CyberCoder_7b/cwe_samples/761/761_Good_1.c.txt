VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code uses a hardcoded buffer size of 40 bytes for the input string, which is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code does not allocate memory for the input string based on the actual input length, but instead uses a fixed size buffer of 40 bytes. This can lead to buffer overflows if the input string is longer than 40
