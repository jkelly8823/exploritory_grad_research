VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed buffer size of 256 bytes. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The use of a fixed buffer size of 256 bytes without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, where the input string length exceeds the buffer size, resulting in memory corruption
