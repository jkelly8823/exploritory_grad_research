VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strcpy() which does not check the length of the source string.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy() function copies the source string into the destination buffer without checking the length of the source string, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source string is longer than
