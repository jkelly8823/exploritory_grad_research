VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The code snippet shows a conditional statement that sets the value of the debug_mode_d variable based on the value of the priv_lvl_o and umode_i variables. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass the intended access control by manipulating the input values of these variables.
