VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The input stream is not checked for size before reading from it, which can lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code reads from the input stream without checking its size, which can lead to buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a fixed-size buffer or implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow.
