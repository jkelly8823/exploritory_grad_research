VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the bitwise AND operation on the first line. The bitwise AND operator '&' is used to extract the first, third, and fifth bits from the key variables. However, if the input value is greater than 3, the result will be greater than the maximum value of a byte (255), which can lead to unexpected behavior
