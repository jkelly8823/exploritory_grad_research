VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it uses a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The ctx, key, and iv variables are not initialized and the RAND_bytes() function may return a larger value than the size of the buffer. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
