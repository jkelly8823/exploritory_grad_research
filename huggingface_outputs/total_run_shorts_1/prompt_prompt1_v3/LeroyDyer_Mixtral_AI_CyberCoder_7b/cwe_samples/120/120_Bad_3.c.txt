VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the strcpy function without bounds checking. The strcpy function does not check the length of the destination string, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy function copies the string pointed to by the second argument into the buffer pointed to by the first argument until the null character is encountered. If the length of
