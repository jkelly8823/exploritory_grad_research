VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks as the input is not validated.
EXPLANATION: The code does not include input validation, which makes it susceptible to buffer overflow attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use input validation to ensure that the input length does not exceed the size of the buffer. Use a safer input function like fgets() or scanf with a limit.
