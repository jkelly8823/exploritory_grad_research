VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the openFileToWrite() and writeToFile() functions without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code does not include any bounds checking for the input parameters, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking for input parameters to prevent buffer overflow. Use standard library functions for file I/
