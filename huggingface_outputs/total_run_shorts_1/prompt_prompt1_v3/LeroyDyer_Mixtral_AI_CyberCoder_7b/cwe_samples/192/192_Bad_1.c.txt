VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of strncpy() with an unsigned integer as the length argument. The function GetUntrustedInt() returns a value of 0xFFFF, which is a large integer value that can be interpreted as a valid input length for strncpy(), allowing the attacker to overwrite memory beyond the bounds of the path array.
