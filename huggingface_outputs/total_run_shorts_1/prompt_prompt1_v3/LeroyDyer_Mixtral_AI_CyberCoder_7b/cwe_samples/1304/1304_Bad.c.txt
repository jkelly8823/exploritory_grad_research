VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function save_config_state() and restore_config_state() both have a potential security vulnerability. The function calls to go_to_sleep() and load_config_file() do not check the return value of get_config_state() and get_config_file() respectively. This means that if these functions return NULL, the program will continue execution without checking for an error.
