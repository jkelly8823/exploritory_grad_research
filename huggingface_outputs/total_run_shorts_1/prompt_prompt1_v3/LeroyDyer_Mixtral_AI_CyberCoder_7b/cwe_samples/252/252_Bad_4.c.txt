VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the use of pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock functions. These functions are used to synchronize access to a shared resource, but they do not provide any protection against race conditions. The code does not include any locking mechanism to prevent concurrent access to the shared resource, which could lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior.
