VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to memory leaks due to the use of malloc without checking for a null return value.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet allocates memory using malloc, but does not check the return value for a null pointer. If malloc fails, the program will continue execution and the memory will not be freed, leading to a memory leak.
