VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array. The pointer is dereferenced without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code dereferences the pointer without bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The pointer is dereferenced with an arithmetic operation that multiplies it by 409
