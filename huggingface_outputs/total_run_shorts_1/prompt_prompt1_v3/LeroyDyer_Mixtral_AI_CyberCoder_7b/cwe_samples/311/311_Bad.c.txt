VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `read` function without bounds checking. The `read` function can read more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code reads data from the socket into the buffer without checking the size of the data, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The buffer is not
