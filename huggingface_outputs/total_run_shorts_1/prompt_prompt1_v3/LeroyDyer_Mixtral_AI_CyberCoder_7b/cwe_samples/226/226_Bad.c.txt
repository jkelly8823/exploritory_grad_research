VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the use of realloc() without bounds checking. The realloc() function can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The realloc() function is used to change the size of a dynamically allocated memory block, but it does not check if the new size is larger than the current size. This can lead
