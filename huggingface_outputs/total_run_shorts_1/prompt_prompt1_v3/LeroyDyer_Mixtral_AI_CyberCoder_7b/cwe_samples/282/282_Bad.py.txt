VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of the SIGKILL signal is dangerous as it does not allow for any recovery or handling of the process. It is better to use SIGTERM signal instead.
EXPLANATION: The SIGKILL signal cannot be caught or handled by the process, which can lead to data loss and other issues. SIGTERM is safer as it allows the process to perform cleanup and shutdown grace
