VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a race condition vulnerability in the deposit and withdraw methods. The lock object is used to synchronize access to the BankAccount object, but the methods do not use the lock object consistently. The deposit method releases the lock object after the update to the balance variable, while the withdraw method does not. This can lead to a race condition where two threads can access the balance variable concurrently,
