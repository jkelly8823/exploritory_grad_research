VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The function choose_bit() subtracts a value from a variable reg_bit, which could result in an integer overflow if the input is not carefully checked. The function call to handle_io_register() may lead to a memory corruption if
