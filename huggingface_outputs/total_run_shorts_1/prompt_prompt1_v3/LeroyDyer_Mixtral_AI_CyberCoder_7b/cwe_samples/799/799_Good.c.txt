VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to brute force attacks due to the lack of rate limiting and the use of a fixed maximum number of attempts.
EXPLANATION: The code does not implement any rate limiting or lockout mechanism, making it susceptible to brute force attacks. The attacker can try all possible combinations of usernames and passwords until they find a valid pair.
