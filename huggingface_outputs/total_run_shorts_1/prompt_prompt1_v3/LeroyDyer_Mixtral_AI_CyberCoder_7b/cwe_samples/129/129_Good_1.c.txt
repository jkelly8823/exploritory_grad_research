VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `sscanf` function without bounds checking. The `sscanf` function is used to read integers from the socket, but it does not check the size of the input against the size of the buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the buffer.
