VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of srand() without a seed is a security risk as it can lead to predictable random number generation.
EXPLANATION: The srand() function without a seed can lead to predictable random number generation, which can be exploited by attackers to predict the sequence of random numbers generated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a seed value that is not predictable, such
