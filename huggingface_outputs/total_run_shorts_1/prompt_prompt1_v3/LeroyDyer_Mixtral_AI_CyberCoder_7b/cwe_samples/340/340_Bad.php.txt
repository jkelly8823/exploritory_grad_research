VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function is vulnerable to a timing attack because it uses the user ID as a seed for the random number generator. An attacker could potentially manipulate the random number generation by controlling the user ID.
EXPLANATION: The use of the user ID as a seed for the random number generator makes the generated session ID predictable and can be used to guess other users's session IDs.
