VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows due to the use of an unsigned int variable. Unsigned ints can only hold positive values, so this variable is susceptible to integer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The use of an unsigned int variable for the size of the hashmap can lead to integer overflows, which can result in unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
