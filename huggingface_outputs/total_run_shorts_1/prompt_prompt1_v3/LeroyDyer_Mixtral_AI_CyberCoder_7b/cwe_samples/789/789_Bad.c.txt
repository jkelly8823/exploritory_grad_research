VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3, 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows due to the use of an unsigned integer. The multiplication of an unsigned integer by the size of a char may result in an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.
