VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of alloca() function which allocates memory on the stack. This can lead to stack overflow and potential security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION: The use of alloca() function to allocate memory on the stack can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities as it does not check the stack size and can exceed the stack limit. This can
