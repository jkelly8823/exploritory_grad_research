VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of a hardcoded secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.
EXPLANATION: The use of a hardcoded secret key in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm can lead to predictability of the key and
