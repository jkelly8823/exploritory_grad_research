VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The multiplication of the constant value by the sign value could result in an integer overflow, which could lead to unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The multiplication of the constant value by the sign value could result in an integer overflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This could potentially cause the program to crash or behave unpredict
