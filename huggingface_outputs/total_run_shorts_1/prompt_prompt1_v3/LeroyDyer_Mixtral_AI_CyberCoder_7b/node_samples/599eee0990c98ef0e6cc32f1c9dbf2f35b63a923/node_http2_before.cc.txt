VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `CHECK_LE()` macro, which does not check for buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `CHECK_LE()` macro is used to check that the offset and length are within the bounds of the buffer, but it does not check for buffer overflow. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the
