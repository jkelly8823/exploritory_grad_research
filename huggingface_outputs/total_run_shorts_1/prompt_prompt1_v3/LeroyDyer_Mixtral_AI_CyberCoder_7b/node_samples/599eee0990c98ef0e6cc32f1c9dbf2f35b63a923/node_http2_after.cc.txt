VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the size of the stream_buf_ab_ variable.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the stream_buf_ab_ variable before passing it to the ToArrayBuffer() function, which could lead to buffer overflow if the size is larger than the allocated memory.
