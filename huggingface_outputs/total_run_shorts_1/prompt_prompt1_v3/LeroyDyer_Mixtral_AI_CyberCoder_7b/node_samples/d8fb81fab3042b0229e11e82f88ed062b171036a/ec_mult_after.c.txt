VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the index k. The calculation of k = scalar + 2*cardinality may result in an integer overflow if cardinality is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of k = scalar + 2*cardinality may result in an integer overflow if cardinality is large enough. This could lead to a
