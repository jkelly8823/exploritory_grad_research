VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the index value for the BN_is_bit_set function call. The calculation of kbit may exceed the maximum value of an unsigned integer, leading to undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION: The calculation of kbit = BN_is_bit_set(lambda, cardinality_bits) may result in
