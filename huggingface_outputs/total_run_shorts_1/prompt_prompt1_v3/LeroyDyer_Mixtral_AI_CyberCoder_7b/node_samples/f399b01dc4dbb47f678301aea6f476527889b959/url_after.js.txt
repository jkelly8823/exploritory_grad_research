VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code imports modules from 'internal' which is a private module and should not be imported directly. Instead, use the 'internal/module' syntax.
EXPLANATION: Importing private modules directly is a security risk as it can expose internal implementation details. Use 'internal/module' to import modules from the internal module namespace.
