VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the nghttp2_frame_unpack_settings_payload2 function. The function call nghttp2_frame_unpack_settings_payload2 does not check the size of the input buffer, which could allow an attacker to pass a large payload that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
