VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack function. The function call to nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack does not check the size of the input value before setting it to the option structure, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input value is larger than the size
