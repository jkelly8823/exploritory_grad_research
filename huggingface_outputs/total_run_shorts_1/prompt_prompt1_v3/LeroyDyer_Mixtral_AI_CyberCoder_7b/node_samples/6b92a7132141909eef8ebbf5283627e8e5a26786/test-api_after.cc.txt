VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a loop that iterates over a large range of indices without bounds checking. The loop could potentially exceed the bounds of the Object.prototype array, leading to memory corruption and undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The loop iterates from 0 to 128 without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow
