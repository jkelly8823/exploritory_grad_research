VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of `require()` without a strict validation of the module object. This could allow for arbitrary code execution if the module object is not properly checked.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the type of the module object passed to `require()`, which could
