VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the `assert.match()` function, which is a weak method for checking for the presence of a specific string pattern in a string. It is recommended to use a more robust method such as `expect(stderr).toContain()` from the `chai` library for more robust error handling and testing.
