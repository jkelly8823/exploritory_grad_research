VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function WPACKET_put_bytes_u64() due to the use of the WPACKET_put_bytes() function without bounds checking. The function call does not include any bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to write beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
