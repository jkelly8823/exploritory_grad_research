VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the SSL_MD() function call. The SSL_MD() function is used to compute the message authentication code (MAC) for the SSL handshake protocol. However, it is not clear from the code snippet whether the function is used with a secure random number generator or a deterministic hash function. If a deterministic hash function is used, it could
