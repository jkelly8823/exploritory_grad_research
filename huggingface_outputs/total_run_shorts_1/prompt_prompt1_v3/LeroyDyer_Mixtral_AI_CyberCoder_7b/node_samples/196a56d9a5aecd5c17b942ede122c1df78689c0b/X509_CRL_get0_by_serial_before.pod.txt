VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains several functions that allocate memory on the heap and return pointers to that memory, but does not free the memory after use. This can lead to memory leaks and potential memory exhaustion.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is freed after use to prevent memory leaks. This can be done by using R<sk_X50
