VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to the RIPEMD160 function may not properly handle large input sizes, which could lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function call to RIPEMD160 may not include input validation, allowing for large input sizes to be passed to the function, which could lead to buffer overflow. This could
