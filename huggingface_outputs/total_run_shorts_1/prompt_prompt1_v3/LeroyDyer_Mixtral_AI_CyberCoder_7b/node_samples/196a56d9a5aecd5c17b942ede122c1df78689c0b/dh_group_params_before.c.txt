VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the ossl_ffc_named_group_get_uid() function, which can lead to memory corruption.
EXPLANATION: The function ossl_ffc_named_group_get_uid() can return a pointer to a buffer that is larger than the size of the allocated memory, leading to
