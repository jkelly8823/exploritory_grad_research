VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a variable-length buffer without bounds checking. The variable eticklen is used to allocate memory for the decryption function call, but it is not checked against the size of the buffer sdec. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The variable eticklen is used to allocate memory for the
