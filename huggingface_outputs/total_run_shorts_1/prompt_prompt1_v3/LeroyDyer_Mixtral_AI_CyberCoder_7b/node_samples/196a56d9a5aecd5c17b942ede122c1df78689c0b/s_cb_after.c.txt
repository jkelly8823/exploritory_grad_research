VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the BIO_printf function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_printf function does not perform bounds checking on the input string, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer alternative such as BIO_write_string or BIO_write_string to avoid buffer
