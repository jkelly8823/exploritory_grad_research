VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains several functions that return pointers to dynamically allocated memory, but does not free those pointers after use. This can lead to memory leaks and potential memory exhaustion.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is freed after use to prevent memory leaks. This can be done by using R<sk_X509_X
