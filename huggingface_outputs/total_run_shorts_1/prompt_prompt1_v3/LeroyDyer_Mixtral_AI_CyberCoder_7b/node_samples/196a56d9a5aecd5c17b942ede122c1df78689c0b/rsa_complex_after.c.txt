VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a conditional compilation block that includes the header file <complex.h> based on the compiler being used. This is a potential security risk as it may introduce undefined behavior if the compiler does not support complex numbers.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks the compiler being used and includes the <complex.h> header file only if it is not DJGPP.
