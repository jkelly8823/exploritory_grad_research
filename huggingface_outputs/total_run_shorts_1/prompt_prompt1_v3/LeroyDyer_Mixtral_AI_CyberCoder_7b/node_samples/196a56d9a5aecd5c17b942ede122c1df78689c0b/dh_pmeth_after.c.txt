VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the absence of bounds checking on the Zlen variable.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not check the size of the Z variable before allocating memory for it, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that Zlen is not greater than the size of the allocated memory
