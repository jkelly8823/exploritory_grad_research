VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the SSL3_RECORD_get_length() function call.
EXPLANATION: The SSL3_RECORD_get_length() function call does not include bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow if the returned length is larger than the size of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
