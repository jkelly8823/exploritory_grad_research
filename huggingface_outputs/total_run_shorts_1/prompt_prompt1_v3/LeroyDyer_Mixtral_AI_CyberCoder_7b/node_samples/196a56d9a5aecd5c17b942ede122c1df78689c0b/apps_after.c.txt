VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed buffer size for the serialfile variable without bounds checking. The use of a fixed buffer size without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a fixed buffer size of 1024 bytes for the serial
