VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of RAND_bytes_ex() function which does not check the return value.
EXPLANATION: The RAND_bytes_ex() function does not check the return value, which can lead to buffer overflow if the output is larger than the size of the iv variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a secure random number generator
