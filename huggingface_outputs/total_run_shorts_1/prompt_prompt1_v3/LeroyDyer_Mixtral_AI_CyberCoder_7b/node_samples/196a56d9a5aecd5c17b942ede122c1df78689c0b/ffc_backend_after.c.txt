VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the strcpy() function without bounds checking. The function strcpy() copies the string pointed to by the prm->data pointer into the buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer. This could lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer boundary, causing a buffer
