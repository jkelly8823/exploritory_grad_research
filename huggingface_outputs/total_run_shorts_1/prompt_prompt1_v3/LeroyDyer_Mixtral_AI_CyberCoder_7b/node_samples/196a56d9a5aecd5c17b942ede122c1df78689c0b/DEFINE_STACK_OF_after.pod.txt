VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains several functions that are implemented as macros, which can lead to undefined behavior if called with invalid inputs or on an empty stack. The use of macros can make it difficult to detect errors at compile time and can lead to runtime errors. The underlying OpenSSL functions should be used instead for better error handling and type checking.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be
