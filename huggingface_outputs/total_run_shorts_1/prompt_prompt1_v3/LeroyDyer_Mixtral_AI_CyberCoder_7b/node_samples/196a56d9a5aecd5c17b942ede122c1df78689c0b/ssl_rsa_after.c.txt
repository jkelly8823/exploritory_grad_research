VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function extension_append() due to the use of memcpy() function without bounds checking. The memcpy() function copies a specified number of bytes from the source string to the destination buffer without checking the length of the source string. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a longer string than the expected length, leading to buffer overflow.
