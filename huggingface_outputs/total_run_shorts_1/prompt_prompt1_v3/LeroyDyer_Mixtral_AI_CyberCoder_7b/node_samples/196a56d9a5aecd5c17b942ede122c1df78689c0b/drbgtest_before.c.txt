VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The code snippet shows a function crngt_skip() which checks whether FIPS_MODULE is defined and returns 1 if it is defined. This function is used to skip the continuous RNG tests. If FIPS_MODULE is defined, the tests are skipped. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass important security checks and
