VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the pointers privkey and pubkey before dereferencing them, which can lead to buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe pointer arithmetic or bounds checking to ensure that the pointers are within the valid range.
