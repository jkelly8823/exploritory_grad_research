VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a security vulnerability in the OpenSSL library. The default xoflen value for shake128 and shake256 is set to half of the maximum security strength, which is not recommended. To ensure maximum security strength, the xoflen should be set to at least 32 bytes for shake128 and 64 bytes for shake256.
