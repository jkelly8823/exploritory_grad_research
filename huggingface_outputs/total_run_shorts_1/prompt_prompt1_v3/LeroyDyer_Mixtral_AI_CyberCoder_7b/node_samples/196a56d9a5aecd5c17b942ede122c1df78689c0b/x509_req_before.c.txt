VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_NID() due to the use of a variable-length input without bounds checking. The function takes a pointer to an unsigned char array as input without bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to pass a larger input than the allocated buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
