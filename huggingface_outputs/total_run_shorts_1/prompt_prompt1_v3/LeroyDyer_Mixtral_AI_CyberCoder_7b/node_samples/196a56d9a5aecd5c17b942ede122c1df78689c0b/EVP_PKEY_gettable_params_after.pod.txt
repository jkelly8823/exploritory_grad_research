VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The variable curve_name is not initialized and has a size of 64 bytes, but the function call strcpy() is used to copy a string with unknown length into it. This can lead to buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION: The variable curve_name is not initialized
