VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the BIO_printf function without a size limit.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_printf function does not have a size limit, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer alternative such as BIO_printf_ex() or implement a size limit to prevent buffer overflow.
