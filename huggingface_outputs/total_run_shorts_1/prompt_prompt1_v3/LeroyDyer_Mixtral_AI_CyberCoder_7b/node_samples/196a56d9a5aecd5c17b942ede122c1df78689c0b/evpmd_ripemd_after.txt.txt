VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the RIPEMD160 algorithm which is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
EXPLANATION: The RIPEMD160 algorithm is known to be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to its lack of bounds checking on input data. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
