VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking for the mdname and mdprops variables.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet declares two char arrays without bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use dynamic memory allocation or bounds
