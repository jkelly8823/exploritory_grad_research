VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the BIO_gets() function which does not check the size of the input data before reading from the input stream. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The BIO_gets() function reads a line from the input stream into the buffer without checking the size of the input data,
