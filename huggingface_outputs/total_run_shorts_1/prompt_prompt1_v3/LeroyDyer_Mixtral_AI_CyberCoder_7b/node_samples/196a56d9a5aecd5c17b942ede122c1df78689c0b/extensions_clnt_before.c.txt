VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the time() function which is not recommended for calculating time differences due to rounding errors. Instead, it is recommended to use the time difference in milliseconds for more accurate calculations.
EXPLANATION: The use of time() function to calculate the age of a session in seconds may lead to rounding errors, which could
