VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generation method. The use of the system time and process ID as part of the nonce generation may introduce predictability in the nonce generation, which can be exploited by an attacker to predict future nonces.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the process ID and
