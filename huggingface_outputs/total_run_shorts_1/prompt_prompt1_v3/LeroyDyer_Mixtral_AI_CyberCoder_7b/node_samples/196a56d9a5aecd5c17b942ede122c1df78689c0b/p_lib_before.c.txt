VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `OPENSSL_malloc()` function without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The use of `OPENSSL_malloc()` without checking the return value for a non-NULL pointer can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the allocation fails. This can result in undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.
