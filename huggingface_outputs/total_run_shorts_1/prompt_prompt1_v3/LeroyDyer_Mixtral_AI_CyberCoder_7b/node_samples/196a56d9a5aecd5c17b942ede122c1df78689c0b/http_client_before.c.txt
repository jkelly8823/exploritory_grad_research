VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the BIO_read function without bounds checking. The BIO_read function does not perform bounds checking on the input buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_read function reads data from a BIO into a buffer without bounds checking,
