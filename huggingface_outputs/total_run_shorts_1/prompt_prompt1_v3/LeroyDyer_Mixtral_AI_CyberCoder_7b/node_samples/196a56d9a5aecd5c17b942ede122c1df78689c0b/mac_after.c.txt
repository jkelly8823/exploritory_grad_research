VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the fgets() function without a size limit.
EXPLANATION: The use of fgets() without a size limit can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it reads a line from the file until a newline character is reached, which can result in the reading of more data than intended. This can lead to memory corruption
