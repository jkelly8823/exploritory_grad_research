VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array element without checking the array bounds. The use of pqueue_next() function to iterate through the pqueue_iterator() function may lead to an out-of-bounds access if the iterator points to an invalid element.
