VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the SMIME_crlf_copy() function, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security exploitation.
EXPLANATION: The SMIME_crlf_copy() function copies data from a buffer into another buffer without checking the size of the source buffer, which can lead to buffer over
