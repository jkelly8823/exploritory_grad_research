VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the RAND_bytes_ex() function is used without bounds checking.

EXPLANATION:
The RAND_bytes_ex() function is used to generate random data, but it does not check the length of the output. This means that if the output is longer than the size of the iv variable, a buffer overflow could occur
