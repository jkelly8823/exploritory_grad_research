VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name()` function which does not check the length of the input string. This function does not perform bounds checking on the input string, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated memory.

EXPLANATION: The `EV
