VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the function ossl_bn_miller_rabin_is_prime() due to the use of the BN_PRIMETEST_PROBABLY_PRIME constant being assigned to the ret variable without checking its value. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the constant is larger than the size of the ret variable.
