VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function copies the contents of the source buffer to the destination buffer until the number of bytes specified by the length parameter. If the length parameter is larger than the size of the destination buffer, it can lead to buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy function copies the contents of the source buffer
