VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a variable-length string without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the length of the sn and ln strings before copying them into the tmpoid->sn and tmpoid->ln fields, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
