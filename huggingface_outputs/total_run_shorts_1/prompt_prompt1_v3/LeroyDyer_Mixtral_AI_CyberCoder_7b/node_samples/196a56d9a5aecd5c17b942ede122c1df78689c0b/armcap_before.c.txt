VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of sigaction() and sigsetjmp() functions. The sigaction() function can be used to change the signal handling of a process, which could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The sigsetjmp() function can be used to jump to a specific location in the code, which could be used
