VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential security vulnerability in the definition of the constants. The use of the #define preprocessor directive to define the error codes for the OpenSSL library. The use of #define statements to define the error codes can lead to naming collisions and make the code harder to read and maintain. Instead, consider using named constants or enumerations to define the error codes.
