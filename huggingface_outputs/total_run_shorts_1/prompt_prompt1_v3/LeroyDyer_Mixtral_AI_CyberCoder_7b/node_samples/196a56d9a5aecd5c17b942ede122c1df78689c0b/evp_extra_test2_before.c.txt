VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The function call to EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name() does not check the size of the buffer for the input string "DHX", which could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
