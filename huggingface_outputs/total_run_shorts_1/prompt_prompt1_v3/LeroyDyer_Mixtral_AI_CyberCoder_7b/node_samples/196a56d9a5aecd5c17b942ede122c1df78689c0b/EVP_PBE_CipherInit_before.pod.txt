VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function EVP_PBE_find_ex() has a potential security vulnerability due to the lack of input validation on the input parameters. If NULL is supplied for any of the parameters pcnid, pmnid, pkeygen, or pkeygen_ex, the function does not return the parameters. This could lead to unintended behavior and potential security issues.
