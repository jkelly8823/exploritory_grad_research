VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the read_all function due to the use of a fixed buffer size without bounds checking. The function reads data into a buffer without checking the size of the input data, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The function reads data into a buffer without checking the size of the input data,
