VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow due to the use of sigaction() and sigprocmask() functions without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The use of sigaction() and sigprocmask() without bounds checking can lead to stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as these functions can modify the stack pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use bounds checking to prevent stack
