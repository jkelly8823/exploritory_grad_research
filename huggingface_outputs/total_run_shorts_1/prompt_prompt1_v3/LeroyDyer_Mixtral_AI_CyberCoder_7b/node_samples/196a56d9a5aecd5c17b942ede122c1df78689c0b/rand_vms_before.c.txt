VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the getpid() function, which can be predictable and therefore the nonce is not truly random.
EXPLANATION: The use of getpid() to generate nonces can lead to predictability in the nonce, which can be exploited by an attacker to perform replay attacks.
