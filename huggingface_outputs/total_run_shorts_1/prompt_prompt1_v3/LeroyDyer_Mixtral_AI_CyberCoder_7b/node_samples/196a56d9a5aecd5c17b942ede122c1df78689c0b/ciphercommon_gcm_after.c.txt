VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function ossl_gcm_initctx() due to the use of the memcpy() function without bounds checking. The memcpy() function copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the length of the source buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
