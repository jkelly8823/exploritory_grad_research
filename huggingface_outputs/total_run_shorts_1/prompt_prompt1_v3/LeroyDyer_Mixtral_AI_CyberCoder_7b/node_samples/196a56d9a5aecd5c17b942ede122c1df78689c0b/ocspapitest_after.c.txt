VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the ASN1_BIT_STRING_set function which does not check the length of the keybytes parameter. This function does not perform bounds checking on the input, allowing for potential buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The ASN1_BIT_STRING_set function does not perform bounds checking on the keybytes parameter, which can
