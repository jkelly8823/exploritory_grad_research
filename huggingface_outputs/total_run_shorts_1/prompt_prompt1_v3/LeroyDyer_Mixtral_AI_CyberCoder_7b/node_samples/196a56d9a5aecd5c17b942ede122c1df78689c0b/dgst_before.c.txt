VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `strlen()` function which does not check the length of the hmac_key string. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `strlen()` function does not check the length of the hmac_key string, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input string is longer
