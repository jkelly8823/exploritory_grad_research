VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function ossl_ffc_named_group_get_q() due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function retrieves the q value from the named_group structure without checking the length of the name string. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the name string is longer than the allocated buffer size
