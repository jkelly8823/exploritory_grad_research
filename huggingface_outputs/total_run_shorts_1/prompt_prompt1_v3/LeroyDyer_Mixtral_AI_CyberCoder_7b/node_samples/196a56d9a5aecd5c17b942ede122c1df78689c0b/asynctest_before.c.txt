VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a function call without checking the return value of the function.
EXPLANATION: The function call to ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_free() and OSSL_LIB_CTX_free() may return an error code, but the code does not check the return value. This could lead to undefined behavior if the function call fails
