VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the EC_POINT_point2oct function which does not check the size of the output buffer.
EXPLANATION: The EC_POINT_point2oct function does not check the size of the output buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the output size is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use
