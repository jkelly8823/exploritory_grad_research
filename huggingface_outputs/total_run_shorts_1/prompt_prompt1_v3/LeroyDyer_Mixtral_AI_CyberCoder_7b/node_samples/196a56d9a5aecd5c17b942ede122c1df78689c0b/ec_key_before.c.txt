VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to timing attacks because it uses a constant time algorithm. The constant time algorithm is used to hide the length of the secret scalar, but it is not secure.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a constant time algorithm to hide the length of the secret scalar, which is not secure. The constant
