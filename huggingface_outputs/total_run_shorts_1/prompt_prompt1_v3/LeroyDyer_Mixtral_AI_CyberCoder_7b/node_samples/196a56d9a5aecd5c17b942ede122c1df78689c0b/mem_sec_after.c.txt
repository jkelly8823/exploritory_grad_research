VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the VirtualLock function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The use of the VirtualLock function without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not perform bounds checking on the input parameters. This can result in memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation and bounds checking
