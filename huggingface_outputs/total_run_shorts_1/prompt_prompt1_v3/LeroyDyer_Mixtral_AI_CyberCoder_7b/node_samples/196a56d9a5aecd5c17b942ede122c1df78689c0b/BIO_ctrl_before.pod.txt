VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The BIO_get_ktls_send() and BIO_get_ktls_recv() macros were added in OpenSSL 3.0, but were modified to never return -1 in OpenSSL 3.0.4. This change was made to prevent the return of -1 from indicating an error.
