VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function EVP_KDF_is_a() checks if a given EVP_KDF object is a specific KDF object by comparing the name of the object with a string. This is a potential security vulnerability as it does not perform any checks on the length of the input string, which could allow for buffer overflows if the input string is not properly sanitized.
