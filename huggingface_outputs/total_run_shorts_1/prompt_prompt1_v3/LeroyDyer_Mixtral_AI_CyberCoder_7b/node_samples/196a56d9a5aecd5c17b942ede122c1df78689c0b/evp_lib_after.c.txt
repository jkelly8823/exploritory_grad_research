VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() due to the use of a variable without bounds checking. The variable v is not checked for bounds before being assigned to ctx->iv_len. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of len is larger than the size of ctx->iv_len
