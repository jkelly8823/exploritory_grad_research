VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the format function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The format function is used to format and print output, but it does not perform bounds checking on the input strings, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer alternative like snprintf
