VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains several potential vulnerabilities. The code snippet is missing input validation and error handling for the `on_chunk_extension()` function, which could allow for buffer overflows and memory corruption. The function does not check the length of the input data, and it does not check the size of the chunk extensions. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
