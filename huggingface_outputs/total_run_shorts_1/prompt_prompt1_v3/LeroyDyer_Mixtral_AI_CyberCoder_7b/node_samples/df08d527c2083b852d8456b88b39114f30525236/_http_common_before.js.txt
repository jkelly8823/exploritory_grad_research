VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the bitwise OR operator (|) on the constant values. The OR operator can result in unexpected behavior when combining two values with different bit lengths.
EXPLANATION: The OR operator (|) is used to combine two values bitwise, which can lead to unexpected results when the bit lengths are not the same. In this
