VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the `Buffer.concat()` method, which can lead to memory exhaustion and potential memory leaks.
EXPLANATION: The `Buffer.concat()` method concatenates multiple buffers into a single buffer, but it does not check for buffer overflow. This can lead to memory exhaustion and potential memory leaks if
