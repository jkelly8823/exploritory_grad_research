VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the `Buffer.concat()` method which can lead to memory exhaustion and potential memory leaks.
EXPLANATION: The use of `Buffer.concat()` method to concatenate the two buffers may result in buffer overflows if the input buffers are not properly checked for length. This can lead to memory exhaust
