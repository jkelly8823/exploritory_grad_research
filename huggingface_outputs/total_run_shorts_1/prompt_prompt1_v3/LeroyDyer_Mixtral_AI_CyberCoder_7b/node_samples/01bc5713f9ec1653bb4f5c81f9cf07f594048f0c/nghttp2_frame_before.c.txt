VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the same buffer for both altsvc->origin and altsvc->field_value.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the same buffer for both altsvc->origin and altsvc->field_value, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the size of altsvc->field_value
