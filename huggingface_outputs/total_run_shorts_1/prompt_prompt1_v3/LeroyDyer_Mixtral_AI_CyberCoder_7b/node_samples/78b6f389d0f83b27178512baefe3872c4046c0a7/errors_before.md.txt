VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential security vulnerability where the maximum number of invalid HTTP/2 frames sent by the peer is not properly handled. The `maxSessionInvalidFrames` option is set to 0, which means that there is no limit on the number of invalid frames allowed. This could lead to a denial of service attack
