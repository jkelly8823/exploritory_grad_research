VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of Symbol() function which can be used to create unique identifiers. Symbol() creates a unique symbol for each instance of a given value. However, it is not recommended to use Symbol() for security purposes as it can lead to memory leaks and potential information disclosure. Instead, use a constant or a unique string or number.
