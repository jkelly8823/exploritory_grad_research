VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential file system access restriction bypass. The code checks if the user has the 'fs.read' permission, but it does not check if the user has the 'fs.read' permission for the specific path. An attacker could potentially bypass this check by having the 'fs.read' permission globally, but not for the specific path.
