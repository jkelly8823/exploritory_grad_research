VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the multiplication by 3 and division by 3 without checking the length of the input string. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet divides the length of the input string by 3 and multiplies it by 4, which can result in an integer overflow if the
