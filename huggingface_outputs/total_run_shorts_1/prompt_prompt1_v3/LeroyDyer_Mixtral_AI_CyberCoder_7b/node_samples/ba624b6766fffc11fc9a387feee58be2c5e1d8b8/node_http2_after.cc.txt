VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability in the Http2Session::OnStreamAfterWrite() function. The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the 'ClearOutgoing()' function call without checking the return value of the 'underlying_stream()->Write()' function call. This could lead to memory corruption and potential security exploits.
