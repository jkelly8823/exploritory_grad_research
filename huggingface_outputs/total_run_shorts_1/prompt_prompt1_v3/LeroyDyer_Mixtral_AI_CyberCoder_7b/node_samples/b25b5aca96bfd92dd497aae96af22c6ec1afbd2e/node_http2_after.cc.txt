VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to memory leaks due to the lack of ownership transfer from the Http2Stream instances to the Http2Session object. The Http2Session destructor does not explicitly take ownership of the Http2Stream instances, which means that the Http2Stream instances will not be destroyed when the Http2Session object goes out of scope. This can lead to memory leaks and resource leaks
