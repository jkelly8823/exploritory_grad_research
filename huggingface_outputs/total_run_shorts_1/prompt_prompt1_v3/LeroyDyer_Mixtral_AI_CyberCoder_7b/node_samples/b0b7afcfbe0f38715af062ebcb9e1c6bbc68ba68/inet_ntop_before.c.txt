VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential security vulnerability where the error code is stored in a global variable errno instead of a local variable. This could lead to information leakage and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: Storing the error code in a global variable can expose sensitive information to other parts of the code, which is a security risk. It is recommended to use a local variable to store
