VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the malloc() function without bounds checking. The malloc() function does not perform bounds checking by default, so there is a risk of memory corruption if the allocated memory is not properly handled.

EXPLANATION: The use of malloc() without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the allocated memory
