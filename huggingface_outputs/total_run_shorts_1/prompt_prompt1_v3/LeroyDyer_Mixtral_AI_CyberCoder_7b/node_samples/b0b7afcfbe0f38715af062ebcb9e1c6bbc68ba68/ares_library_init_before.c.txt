VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the malloc and realloc functions without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The use of malloc and realloc without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as these functions do not check the size of the allocated memory against the requested size. This can result in memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
