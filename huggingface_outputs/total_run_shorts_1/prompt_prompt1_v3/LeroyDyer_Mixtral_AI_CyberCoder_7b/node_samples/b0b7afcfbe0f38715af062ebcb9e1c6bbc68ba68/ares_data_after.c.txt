VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential memory leak vulnerability due to the use of raw pointer arithmetic to access the struct members. The use of pointer arithmetic to access struct members can lead to undefined behavior if the struct layout is not consistent across different architectures or compiler optimizations. It is recommended to use the offsetof macro instead.

EXPLANATION: The code uses pointer arithmetic
