VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential memory leak vulnerability due to the use of raw pointer arithmetic to access the struct members. The use of pointer arithmetic to access struct members can lead to undefined behavior if the pointer is not properly aligned. It is recommended to use the offsetof macro to calculate the correct offset instead.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses pointer arith
