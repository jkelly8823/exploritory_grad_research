VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function call to strncpy() does not include a bounds check, which could lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer bounds, causing a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function call to strn
