VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of memset() function to clear the memory of OsvEx structure. memset() is not suitable for zeroing memory beyond the bounds of the structure. It is recommended to use memset_s() or RTL functions like memset_s() or memzero_s() to clear memory safely.
