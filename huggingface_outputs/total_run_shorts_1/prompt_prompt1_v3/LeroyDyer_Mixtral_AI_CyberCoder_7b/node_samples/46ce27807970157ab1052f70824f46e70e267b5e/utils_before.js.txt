VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the BufferFrom function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The BufferFrom function does not perform bounds checking on the input, which could lead to buffer overflows if the input is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method for converting strings to buffers, such as Buffer.from
