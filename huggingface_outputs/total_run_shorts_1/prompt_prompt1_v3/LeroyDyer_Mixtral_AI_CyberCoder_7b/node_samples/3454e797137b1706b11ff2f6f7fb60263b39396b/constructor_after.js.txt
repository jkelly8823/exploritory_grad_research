VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the addition operation.
EXPLANATION: The addition operation between iterKey and length can result in integer overflows, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe integer type, such as BigInt, to avoid integer overflows. Alternatively, use a loop to iterate through the keys instead of
