VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to memory leaks due to the use of raw pointers. The code does not properly manage the lifetime of the AsyncWrap object, which can lead to memory leaks.
EXPLANATION: The code creates an AsyncWrap object using a raw pointer, but does not manage its lifetime. This can result in memory leaks if the object is not properly cleaned up.
