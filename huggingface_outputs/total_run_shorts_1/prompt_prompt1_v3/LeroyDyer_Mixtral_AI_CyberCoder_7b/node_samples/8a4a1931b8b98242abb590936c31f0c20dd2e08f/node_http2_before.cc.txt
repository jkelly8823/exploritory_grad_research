VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function Http2Session::Write. The function call to nghttp2_session_mem_recv() does not check the size of the input buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input buffer is larger than the available memory. This could result in a memory corruption and a potential security vulnerability.
