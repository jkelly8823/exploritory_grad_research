VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the nghttp2_hd_deflate_init2() function. The function call nghttp2_hd_deflate_init2() does not check the size of the memory allocation for the session->mem parameter, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the memory allocation is too small.
