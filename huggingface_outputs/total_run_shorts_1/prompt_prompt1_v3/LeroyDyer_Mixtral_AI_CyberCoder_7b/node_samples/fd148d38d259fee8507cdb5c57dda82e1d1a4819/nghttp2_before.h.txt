VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function nghttp2_option_set_no_closed_streams() is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a single integer parameter. The function does not check the size of the input value, allowing a potential attacker to pass a large value that can be used to overwrite memory beyond the buffer bounds.
