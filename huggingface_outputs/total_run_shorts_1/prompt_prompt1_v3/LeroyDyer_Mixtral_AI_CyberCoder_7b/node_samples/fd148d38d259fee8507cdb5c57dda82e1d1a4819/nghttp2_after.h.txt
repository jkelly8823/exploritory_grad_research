VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function nghttp2_option_set_no_closed_streams() and nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack() are vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call does not check the input value for bounds checking, allowing a potential attacker to pass a large value to the function, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
