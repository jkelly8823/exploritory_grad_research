VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array without checking the array bounds. The pointer arithmetic operation on args[offset + 1] may lead to a buffer overflow if the array index is out of bounds.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses pointer arithmetic to access the second element of the array
