VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code uses pointer arithmetic to access the next element in the array without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow if the array index is out of bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method to access array
