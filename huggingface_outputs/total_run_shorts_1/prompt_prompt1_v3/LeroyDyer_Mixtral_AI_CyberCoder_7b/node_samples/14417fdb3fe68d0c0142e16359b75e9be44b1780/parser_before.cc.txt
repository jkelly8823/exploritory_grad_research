VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable without bounds checking. The function call to `zone()` may return a string with a length greater than the maximum allowed length, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the length is not checked before use.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the length of the result of the `zone()
