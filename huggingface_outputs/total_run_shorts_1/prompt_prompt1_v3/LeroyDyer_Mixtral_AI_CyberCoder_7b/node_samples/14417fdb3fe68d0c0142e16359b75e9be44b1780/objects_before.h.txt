VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The use of an enumeration type with a limited range of values could lead to integer overflows, which can cause unexpected behavior. The use of a constant value for the number of arguments in a function call may not be encodable in an
