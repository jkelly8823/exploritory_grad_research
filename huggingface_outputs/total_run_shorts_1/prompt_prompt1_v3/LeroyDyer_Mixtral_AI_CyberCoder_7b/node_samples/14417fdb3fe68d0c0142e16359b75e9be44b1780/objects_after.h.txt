VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the definition of the FLAGS_MAX_VALUE constant. The constant FLAGS_MAX_VALUE is defined as the maximum value of an enumeration type, which is 0xFFFFFFFF, which is the maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer. This could lead to integer overflows if the value is not
