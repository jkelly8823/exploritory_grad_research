VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `resolvePath` function without proper input validation. The function is called without checking the length of the input string, which could allow an attacker to pass a large input string that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
