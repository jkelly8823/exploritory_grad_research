VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to Write() may write more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a pointer arithmetic to calculate the number of characters to write, which can result in a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size. The alignment check is not sufficient to
