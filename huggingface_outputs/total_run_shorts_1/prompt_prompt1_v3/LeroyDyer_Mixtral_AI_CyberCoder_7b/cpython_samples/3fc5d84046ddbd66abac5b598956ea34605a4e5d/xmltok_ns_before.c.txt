VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The XmlUtf8Convert function may write more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The buffer is defined with a fixed size of ENCODING_MAX, but the function does not check the length of the input data before
