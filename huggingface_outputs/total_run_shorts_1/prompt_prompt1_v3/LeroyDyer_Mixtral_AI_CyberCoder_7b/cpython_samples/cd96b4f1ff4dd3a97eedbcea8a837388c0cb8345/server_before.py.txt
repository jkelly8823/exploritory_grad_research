VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the lack of bounds checking on the chunk_size variable.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if chunk_size is within a safe range before appending it to the list L, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input is not properly sanitized
