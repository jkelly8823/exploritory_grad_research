VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function _getline() reads a line from the file object using readline() with a fixed buffer size of _MAXLINE. If the line is longer than _MAXLINE, it raises an error. This can lead to buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attack
