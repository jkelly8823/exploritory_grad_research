VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the int() function without bounds checking. The int() function can convert strings to integers, but it does not check the length of the input string. This can lead to integer overflows and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The int() function can convert strings to integers
