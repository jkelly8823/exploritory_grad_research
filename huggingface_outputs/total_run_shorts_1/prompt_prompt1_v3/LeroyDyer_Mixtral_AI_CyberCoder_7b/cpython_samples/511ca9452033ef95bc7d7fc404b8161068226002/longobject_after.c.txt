VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the function _Py_DECREF_INT() due to the use of the PyLong_FromLong() function, which can lead to memory corruption and buffer overflow. The function does not check the size of the input string before converting it to an integer, which could result in a buffer overflow if the input string is too large.
