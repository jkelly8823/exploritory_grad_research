VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed buffer size of 2048 bytes for reading data from the NNTP server. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities as the buffer may not be able to handle large responses from the server, resulting in a buffer overflow.
