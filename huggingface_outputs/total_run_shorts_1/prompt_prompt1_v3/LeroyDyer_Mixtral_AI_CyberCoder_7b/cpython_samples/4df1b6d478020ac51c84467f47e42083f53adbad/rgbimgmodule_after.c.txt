VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the variable 'tablen'. The division operation may result in an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The division operation ((tablen / ysize) / zsize) may result in an integer overflow, causing the value of 'tablen' to be larger than the maximum value representable by
