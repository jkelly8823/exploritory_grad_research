VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of BIO_gets() function which does not check the length of the input string before reading it into the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: The BIO_gets() function reads a line from a BIO object into a buffer without checking the length of the input string, which can lead
