VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The buffer_size variable is not checked against the actual size of the input data, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input data exceeds the allocated buffer size.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking, which
