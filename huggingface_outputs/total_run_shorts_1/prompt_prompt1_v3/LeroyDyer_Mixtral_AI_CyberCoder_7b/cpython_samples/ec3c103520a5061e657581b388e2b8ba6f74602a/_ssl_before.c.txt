VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function BIO_gets() is used to read from a stream into a buffer without checking the length of the input. This can lead to buffer overflow if the input is longer than the buffer size.

EXPLANATION: The function BIO_gets() reads a line from a stream
