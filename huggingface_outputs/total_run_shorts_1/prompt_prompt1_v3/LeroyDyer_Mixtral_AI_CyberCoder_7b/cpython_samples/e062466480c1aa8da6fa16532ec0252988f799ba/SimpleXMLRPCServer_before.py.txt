VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4, 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the lack of bounds checking on the chunk_size variable.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if chunk_size is within a safe range, allowing for potential buffer overflow attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking to ensure that chunk
