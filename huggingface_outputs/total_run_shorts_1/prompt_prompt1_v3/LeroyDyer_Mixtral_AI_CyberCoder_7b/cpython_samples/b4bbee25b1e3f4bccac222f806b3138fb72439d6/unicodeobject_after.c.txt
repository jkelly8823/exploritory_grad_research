VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operations without bounds checking. The pointer arithmetic operations on q and e may lead to memory access beyond the end of the allocated memory, which can result in a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains pointer arithmetic operations on q and e without bounds checking, which can
