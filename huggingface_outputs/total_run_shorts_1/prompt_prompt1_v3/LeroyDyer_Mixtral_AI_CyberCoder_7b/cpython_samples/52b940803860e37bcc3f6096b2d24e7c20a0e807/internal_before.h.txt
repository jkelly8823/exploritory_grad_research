VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the strcpy function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The use of strcpy function without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it copies the entire string pointed to by the src pointer into the dest buffer until the null terminator is reached, without checking if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data
