VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to the strcpy() function, which can lead to memory corruption and program crashes.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy() function is used to copy a string from a source string to a destination buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the available
