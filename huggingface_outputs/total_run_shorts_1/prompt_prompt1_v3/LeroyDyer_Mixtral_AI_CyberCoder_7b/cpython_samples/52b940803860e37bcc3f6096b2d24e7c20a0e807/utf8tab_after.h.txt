VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the strcpy() function, which is a dangerous function that can lead to memory corruption and buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The use of strcpy() function to copy a string into a buffer without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it does not check the size of the destination buffer. This can
