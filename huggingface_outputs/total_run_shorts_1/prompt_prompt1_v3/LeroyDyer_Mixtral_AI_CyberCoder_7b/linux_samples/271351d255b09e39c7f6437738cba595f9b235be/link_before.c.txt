VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the kfree_skb() function without checking the size of the input data. This function can free the allocated memory, but it does not check the size of the input data, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
