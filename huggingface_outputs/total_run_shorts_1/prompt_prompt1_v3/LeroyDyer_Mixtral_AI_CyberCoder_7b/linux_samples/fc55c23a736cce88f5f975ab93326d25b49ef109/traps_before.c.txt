VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow on the line: 
vectors = (unsigned long)vectors_base;

EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow on the line: vectors = (unsigned long)vectors_base; because the cast from void * to unsigned long can result in truncation of the value of vectors_base, which can
