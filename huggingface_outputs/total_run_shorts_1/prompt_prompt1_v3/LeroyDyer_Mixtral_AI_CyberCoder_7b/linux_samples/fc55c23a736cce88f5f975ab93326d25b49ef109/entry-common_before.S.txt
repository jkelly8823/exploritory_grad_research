VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the sub instruction without checking the result of the arithmetic operation.
EXPLANATION: The sub instruction is used to subtract the value of r12 from the stack pointer (sp) without checking the result. If the result is negative, it could lead to a stack underflow, which can cause a buffer
