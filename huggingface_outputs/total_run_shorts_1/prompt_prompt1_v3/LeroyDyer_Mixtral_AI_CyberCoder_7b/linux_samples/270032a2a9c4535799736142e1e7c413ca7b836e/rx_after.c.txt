VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability in the if statement. The if statement checks if the address is multicast and then checks the cipher suite. If the address is multicast, the code drops the packet. However, there is no check for the encryption type. This could allow an attacker to potentially send malicious packets to the device without encryption.
