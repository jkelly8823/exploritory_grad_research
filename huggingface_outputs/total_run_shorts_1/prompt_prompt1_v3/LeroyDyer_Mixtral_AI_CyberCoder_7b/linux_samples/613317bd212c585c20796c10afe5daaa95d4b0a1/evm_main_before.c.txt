VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcmp function without bounds checking. The memcmp function copies the entire contents of the xattr_data buffer into the calc.digest buffer without checking the length of the data. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the xattr_data buffer is larger than the calc.digest buffer.
