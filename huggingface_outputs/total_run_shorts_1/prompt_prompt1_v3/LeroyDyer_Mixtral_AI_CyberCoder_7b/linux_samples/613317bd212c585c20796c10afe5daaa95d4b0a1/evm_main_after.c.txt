VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `crypto_memneq()` function which does not check the size of the input data against the size of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `crypto_memneq()` function is used to compare the size of the input data with the size of the buffer, but it
