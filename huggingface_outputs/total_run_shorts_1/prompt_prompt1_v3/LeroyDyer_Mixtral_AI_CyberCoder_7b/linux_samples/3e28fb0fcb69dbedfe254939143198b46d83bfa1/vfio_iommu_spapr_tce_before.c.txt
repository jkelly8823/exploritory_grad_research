VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential race condition vulnerability due to the lack of a locking mechanism in the mutex_unlock() call.
EXPLANATION: The mutex_unlock() call is executed without a locking mechanism, which could lead to data races and unpredictable behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a locking mechanism to ensure that the mutex is released
