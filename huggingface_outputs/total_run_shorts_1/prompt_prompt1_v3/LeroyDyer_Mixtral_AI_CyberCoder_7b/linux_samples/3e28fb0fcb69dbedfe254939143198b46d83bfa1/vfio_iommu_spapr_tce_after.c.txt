VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential race condition vulnerability due to the lack of a locking mechanism in the mutex_unlock() call.
EXPLANATION: The mutex_unlock() call in the code snippet is executed without a locking mechanism, which could lead to a race condition where the mutex is unlocked before the mutex is actually locked. This could result in un
