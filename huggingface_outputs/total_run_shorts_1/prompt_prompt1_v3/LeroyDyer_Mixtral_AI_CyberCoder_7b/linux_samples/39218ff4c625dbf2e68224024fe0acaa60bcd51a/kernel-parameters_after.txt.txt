VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability related to the randomization of the kernel stack offset. The use of the CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU flag can introduce a security risk if not properly configured, as it can lead to deterministic stack addresses, which can be exploited by attackers.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the configuration of the kernel'
