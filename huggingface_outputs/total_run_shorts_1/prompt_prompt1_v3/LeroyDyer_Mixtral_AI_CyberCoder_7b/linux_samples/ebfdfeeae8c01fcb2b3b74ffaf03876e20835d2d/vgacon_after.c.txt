VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to scr_memcpyw() can result in a buffer overflow if the input pointer p points to a location with insufficient space.
EXPLANATION: The function scr_memcpyw() copies a block of memory from the source to the destination buffer. If the source pointer points to a location with insufficient space, it can lead to buffer overflow
