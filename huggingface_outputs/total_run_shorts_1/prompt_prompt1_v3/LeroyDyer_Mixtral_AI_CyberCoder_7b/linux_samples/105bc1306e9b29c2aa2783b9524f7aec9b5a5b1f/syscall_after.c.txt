VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the switch statement. The switch statement is not exhaustive, and the default case returns an error code (-EINVAL) which could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement does not cover all possible values of the ptype variable, allowing for integer overflows to cause unintended behavior
