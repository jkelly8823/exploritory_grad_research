VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the function call to load_byte() and load_half() functions. These functions may not check the size of the input data, which could lead to buffer overflows if the input data is larger than expected.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains function calls to load_byte() and load_half() without bounds checking, which
