VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of malloc() without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The malloc() function is used to allocate memory, but it does not check the return value. If malloc() fails, it will return a NULL pointer, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use calloc() instead
