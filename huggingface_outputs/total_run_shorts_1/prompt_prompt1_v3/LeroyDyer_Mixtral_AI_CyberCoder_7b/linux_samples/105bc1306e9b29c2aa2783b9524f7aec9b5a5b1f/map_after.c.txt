VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of malloc() without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The malloc() function is used to allocate memory, but it does not check the return value for a NULL pointer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the allocation fails. This could result in memory corruption and a potential security vulnerability.
