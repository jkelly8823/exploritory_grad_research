VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the nla_len function due to the absence of bounds checking on the nla_len variable. The function nla_len returns the length of the nlattr structure without checking if the length is within the valid range. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a malicious input to overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading
