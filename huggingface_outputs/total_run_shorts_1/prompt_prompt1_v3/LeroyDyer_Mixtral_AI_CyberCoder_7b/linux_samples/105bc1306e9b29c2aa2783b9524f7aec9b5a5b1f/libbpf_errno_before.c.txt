VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the snprintf function without bounds checking. The snprintf function is used to format and write a string to a buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size, which could result in a security vulnerability.
