VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function is used to copy the fd value into the XDP attribute without checking the size of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy the fd value into the XDP attribute without checking the size of the buffer, which
