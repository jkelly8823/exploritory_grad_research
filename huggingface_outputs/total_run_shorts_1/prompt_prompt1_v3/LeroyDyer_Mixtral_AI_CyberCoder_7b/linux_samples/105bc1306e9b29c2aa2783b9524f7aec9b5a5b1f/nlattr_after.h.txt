VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the nla_parse function. The function nla_parse() does not check the length of the input data before copying it into the output buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The nla_parse() function copies the data from the input buffer into the output buffer without checking the length of the input data, which
