VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains two macros, FENCE_SWAPGS_USER_ENTRY and FENCE_SWAPGS_KERNEL_ENTRY, which are used to prevent speculative execution of swapgs instructions when coming from user space and kernel space, respectively. These macros are used to mitigate Spectre v1 vulnerabilities. However, the use of these macros may introduce performance overhead and
