VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the spectre_v2_enabled variable being defined as a static variable. This variable is not initialized and can contain uninitialized values, which can lead to undefined behavior and potential security risks.
EXPLANATION: The variable spectre_v2_enabled is defined as a static variable without an initial value, which can
