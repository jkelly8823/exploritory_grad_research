VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `strlen()` function without bounds checking. The `errmsg` variable is not checked for length before passing it to the `b43err()` function, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the string exceeds the buffer size
