VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the X86_EFLAGS_IF bitmask. The use of bitmasks can lead to integer overflows and memory corruption.
EXPLANATION: The use of bitmasks can lead to integer overflows and memory corruption due to the implicit conversion from a larger integer type to a smaller integer type. The
