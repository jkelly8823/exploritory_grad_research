VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function snd_seq_cell_free() is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the absence of bounds checking on the cell argument. The function call does not check the size of the cell pointer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the cell pointer points to an invalid memory location.

EXPLANATION: The function call to snd_seq_cell_free() does not include any bounds
