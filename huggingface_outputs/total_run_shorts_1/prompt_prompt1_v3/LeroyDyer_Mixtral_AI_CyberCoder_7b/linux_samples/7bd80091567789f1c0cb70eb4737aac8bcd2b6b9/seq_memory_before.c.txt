VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of spin_lock_irq() and spin_unlock_irq() in the same function. The spin_lock_irq() call can be interrupted by a signal, which can lead to a data race between the locking and unlocking of the lock. This can result in a deadlock or incorrect locking behavior.
