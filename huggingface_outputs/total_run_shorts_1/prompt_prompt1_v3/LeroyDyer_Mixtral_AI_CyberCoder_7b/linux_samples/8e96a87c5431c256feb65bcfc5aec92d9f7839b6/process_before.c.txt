VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memset() can lead to buffer overflow as it writes beyond the bounds of the regs->gpr array.
EXPLANATION: The memset() function writes a specified value to a block of memory. In this case, it writes 0 to the entire regs->gpr array, which is an array of
