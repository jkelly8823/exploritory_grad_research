VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call nla_len() can return a value greater than the size of the buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function nla_len() returns the length of the data in the buffer, but it does not check if the length is within the bounds of the buffer. If the length
