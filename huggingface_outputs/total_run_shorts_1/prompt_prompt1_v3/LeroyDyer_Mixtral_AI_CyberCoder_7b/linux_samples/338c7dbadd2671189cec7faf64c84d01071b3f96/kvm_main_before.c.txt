VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet creates a pointer variable without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe memory allocation method such as malloc() or calloc() to allocate memory and check for NULL pointer before dereferencing.
