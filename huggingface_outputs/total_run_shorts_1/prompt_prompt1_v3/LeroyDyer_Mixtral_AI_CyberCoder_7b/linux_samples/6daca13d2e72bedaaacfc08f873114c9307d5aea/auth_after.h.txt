VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function declarations do not include return types, which is a violation of the C standard.

EXPLANATION:
The C standard requires that all functions have a return type specified. In this case, the return types are missing. This can lead to undefined behavior and makes the code harder to understand.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add return types to the function declarations
