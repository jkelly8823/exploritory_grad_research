VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The recvfrom() function call does not check the size of the buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the received data exceeds the size of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a dynamic buffer or implement bounds checking to prevent buffer
