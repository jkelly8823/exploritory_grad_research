VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the definition of the CHANNEL_SWITCH_START_NOTIF structure. The id_and_color field is defined as a 32-bit integer, but the value 0xFF is assigned to it, which is outside the range of valid values for a 32-bit integer. This could lead to memory corruption
