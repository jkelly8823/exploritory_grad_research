VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the devm_regulator_get() function which does not check the size of the input string.
EXPLANATION: The devm_regulator_get() function does not check the size of the input string, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input string is larger than the allocated memory.
