VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a format string. The format string is not checked for validity, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The format string is not checked for validity, allowing for arbitrary code execution. The format string is passed directly to the printf function without any checks. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
