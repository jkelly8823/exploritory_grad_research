VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflows vulnerability in the if statement. The if statement checks multiple conditions using bitwise operators and comparisons, which could lead to integer overflows if the values are not carefully checked. The comparison of unsigned integers could result in unexpected behavior if the values are not within the range of the data type.

EXPLANATION: The if statement
