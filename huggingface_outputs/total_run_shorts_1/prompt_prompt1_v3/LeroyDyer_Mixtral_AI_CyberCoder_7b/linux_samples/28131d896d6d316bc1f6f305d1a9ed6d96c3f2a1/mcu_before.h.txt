VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the definition of the struct ra_phy. The struct ra_phy has a field of type u8 which is assigned a value of 0x8, which is a value that is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an 8-bit unsigned integer. This could lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption if the value is larger
