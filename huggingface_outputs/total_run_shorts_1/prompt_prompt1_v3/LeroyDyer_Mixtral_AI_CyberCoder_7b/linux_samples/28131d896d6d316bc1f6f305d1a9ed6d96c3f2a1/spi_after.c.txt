VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the dev_err_probe function call without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The dev_err_probe function call does not include bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow. Use a safe function call or limit the size of the input string to
