VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function iwl_fw_runtime_init() has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array for the struct iwl_fw_paging_db. The function does not check the size of the input data before copying it into the array, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the allocated size.
