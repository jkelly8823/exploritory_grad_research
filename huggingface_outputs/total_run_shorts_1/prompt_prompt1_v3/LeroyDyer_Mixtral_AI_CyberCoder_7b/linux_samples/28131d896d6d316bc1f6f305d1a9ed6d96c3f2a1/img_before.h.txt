VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function get_fw_dbg_mode_string() is not properly checking the input parameter mode. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The function does not check the input parameter mode for validity, which could allow a malicious actor to pass invalid values and potentially overwrite the stack or heap memory.
