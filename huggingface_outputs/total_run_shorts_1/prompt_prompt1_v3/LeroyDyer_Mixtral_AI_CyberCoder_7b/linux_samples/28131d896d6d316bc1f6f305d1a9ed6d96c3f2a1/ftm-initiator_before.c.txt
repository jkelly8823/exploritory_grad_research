VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a switch statement without a default case. If an invalid value is passed to the switch statement, it will result in undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement does not have a default case, which means that if an invalid value is passed to it, the behavior is undefined. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability
