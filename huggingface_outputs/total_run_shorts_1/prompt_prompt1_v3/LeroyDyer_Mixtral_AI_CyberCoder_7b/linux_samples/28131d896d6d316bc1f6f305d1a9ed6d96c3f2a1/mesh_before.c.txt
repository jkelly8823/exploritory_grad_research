VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of snprintf without bounds checking. The snprintf function does not perform bounds checking on the buffer size, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The snprintf function does not perform bounds checking on the buffer size, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
