VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the struct definition of the iwl_wowlan_status structure. The struct definition contains a field with a variable of type u8, which is an unsigned 8-bit integer. If the size of the struct is not properly aligned, it could lead to buffer overflow when the struct is packed. This could result in memory corruption and potential
