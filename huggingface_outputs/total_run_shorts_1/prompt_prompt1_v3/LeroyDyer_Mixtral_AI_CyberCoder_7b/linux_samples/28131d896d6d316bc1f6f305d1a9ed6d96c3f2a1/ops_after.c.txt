VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains several functions that clear memory with a constant value, which can be a potential security vulnerability. The functions iwl_mvm_frob_txf_key_iter(), iwl_mvm_frob_hcmd(), and iwl_mvm_frob_mem() all clear memory with a constant value. This can lead to information leakage and potential security
