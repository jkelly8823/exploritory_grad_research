VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function iwl_dbg_tlv_alloc_hcmd() due to the use of a fixed-size array without bounds checking. The function iwl_dbg_tlv_alloc_hcmd() allocates memory for the hcmd_list without checking the size of the array. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the number of
