VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the strcpy() function without bounds checking. The strcpy() function is used to copy a string from src to dest, but it does not check the size of the destination buffer, which could lead to buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer. This could result in memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
