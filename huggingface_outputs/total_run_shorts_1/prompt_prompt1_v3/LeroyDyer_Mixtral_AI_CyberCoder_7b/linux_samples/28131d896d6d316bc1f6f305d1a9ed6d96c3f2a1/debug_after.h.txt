VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the __packed attribute on structs. The __packed attribute is used to pack the structs tightly together, but it can lead to buffer overflows if the structs are not properly initialized.
EXPLANATION: The use of the __packed attribute can lead to buffer overflows if the structs are not
