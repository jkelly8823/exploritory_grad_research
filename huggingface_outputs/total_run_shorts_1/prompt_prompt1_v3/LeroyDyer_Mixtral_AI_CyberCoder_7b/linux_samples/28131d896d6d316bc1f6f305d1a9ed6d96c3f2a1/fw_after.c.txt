VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the use of the iwl_acpi_get_dsm_u8() function, which is used to read a single byte from the ACPI table. The function is not designed to read a single byte, but rather a 32-bit value. This could lead to a memory corruption issue if the ACPI table is not properly aligned
