VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function mt7915_sta_fixed_rate_set() due to the use of the sscanf() function without bounds checking. The function reads data from user space into the phy structure without checking the size of the input buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the structure.
