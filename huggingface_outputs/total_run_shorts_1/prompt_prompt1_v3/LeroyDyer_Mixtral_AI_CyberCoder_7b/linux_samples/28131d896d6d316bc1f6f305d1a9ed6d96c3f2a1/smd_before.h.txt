VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function wcn36xx_smd_start_hw_scan() has a potential vulnerability due to the use of a pointer to a structure without checking its validity. The function takes a pointer to a structure as an argument, but there is no check to ensure that the pointer is not NULL. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a potential crash or undefined behavior.
