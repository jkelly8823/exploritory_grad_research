VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function __iwl_err() is vulnerable to format string vulnerabilities due to the use of the va_start() and va_end() functions without checking the number of arguments passed to it. These functions do not check the number of arguments passed to them, so a malicious actor could potentially pass a large number of arguments to overwrite the stack and execute arbitrary code.
