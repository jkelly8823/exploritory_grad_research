VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the function iwl_mvm_protect_session() where the duration of the session protection is hardcoded to 500ms. This could be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial of service attack by flooding the access point with deauthentication packets, causing the session to be locked for a long time.
