VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the va_format structure. The va_start() function is used to initialize the va_format structure, but it does not check the size of the input format string. An attacker could potentially pass a large format string to the function, which could lead to buffer overflow and cause a stack overflow.
