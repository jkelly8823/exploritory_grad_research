VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to iwl_mvm_get_sar_geo_profile() does not check the return value, so if the function returns a value larger than the size of the wgds_tbl_idx variable, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
