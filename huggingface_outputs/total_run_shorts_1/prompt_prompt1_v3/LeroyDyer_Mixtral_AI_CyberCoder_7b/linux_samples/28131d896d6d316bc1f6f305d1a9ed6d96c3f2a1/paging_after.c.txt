VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function copies a specified number of bytes from a source string to a destination buffer. If the source string is longer than the destination buffer, it can lead to buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The memcpy function copies a
