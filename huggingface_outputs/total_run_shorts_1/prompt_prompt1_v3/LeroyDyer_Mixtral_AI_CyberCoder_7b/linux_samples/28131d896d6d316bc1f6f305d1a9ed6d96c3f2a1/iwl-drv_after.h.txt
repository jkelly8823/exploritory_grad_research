VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the NVM_RF_CFG_STEP_MSK macro. The macro shifts the input value right by 2 bits, which could lead to integer overflows if the input value is not properly checked.

EXPLANATION: The macro shifts the input value by 2 bits, but it does not check if the input
