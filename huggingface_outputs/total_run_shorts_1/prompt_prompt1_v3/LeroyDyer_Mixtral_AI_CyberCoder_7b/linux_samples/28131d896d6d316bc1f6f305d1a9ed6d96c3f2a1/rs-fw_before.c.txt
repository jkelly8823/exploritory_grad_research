VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the if statement on line 10. The variable 'chains' is compared to a constant value 'ANT_C' using the bitwise AND operator '&'. This comparison can result in unexpected behavior if the value of 'chains' is larger than the constant value. The correct way to compare two unsigned integers is to use the
