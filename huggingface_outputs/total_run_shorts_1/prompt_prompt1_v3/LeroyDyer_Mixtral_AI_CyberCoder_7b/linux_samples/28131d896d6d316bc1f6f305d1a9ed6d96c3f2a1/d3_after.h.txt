VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the __packed attribute on the struct definition. The use of __packed attribute can lead to buffer overflows if the struct fields are not properly aligned.

EXPLANATION: The __packed attribute is used to force the compiler to pack the struct fields without alignment, which can lead to buffer overflows if the
