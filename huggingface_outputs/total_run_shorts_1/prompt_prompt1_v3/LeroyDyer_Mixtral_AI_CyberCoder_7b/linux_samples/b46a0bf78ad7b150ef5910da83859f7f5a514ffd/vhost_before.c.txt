VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet allocates memory for vq->indirect, vq->log, and vq->heads using kmalloc_array() with GFP_KERNEL. However, it does not check the return value of kmalloc_array() for NULL. If kmalloc_array() fails, it will return NULL, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference and a potential memory access violation
