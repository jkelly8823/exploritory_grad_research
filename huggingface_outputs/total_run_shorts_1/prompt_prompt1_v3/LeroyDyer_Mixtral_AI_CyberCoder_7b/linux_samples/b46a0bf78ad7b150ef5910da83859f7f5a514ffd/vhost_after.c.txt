VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet allocates memory for vq->indirect, vq->log, and vq->heads using kmalloc_array() with GFP_KERNEL. This function is known to be vulnerable to memory exhaustion attacks. The allocations are not guarded by any checks on the return value, so if the allocations fail, the program will crash.
