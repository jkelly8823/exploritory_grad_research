VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the shift value for the cid_mask variable. The calculation of the cid_mask variable may result in an integer overflow, which could lead to unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of the cid_mask variable involves a bitwise AND operation between a constant value (0xffff) and a
