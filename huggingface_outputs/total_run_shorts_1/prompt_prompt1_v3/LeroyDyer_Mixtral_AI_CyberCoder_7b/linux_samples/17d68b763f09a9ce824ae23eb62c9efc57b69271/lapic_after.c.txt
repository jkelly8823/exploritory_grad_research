VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the value of the variable 'new->cid_shift'. The calculation of 'new->cid_shift' may result in an integer overflow due to the bitwise AND operation between 'new->cid_mask' and '0xff' which is a constant value. This could lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities
