VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential memory leak vulnerability due to the use of the 'unlikely' keyword. The 'unlikely' keyword is used to indicate that the condition is unlikely to occur, but it is not a guarantee. If the condition does occur, the code will not free the memory allocated by 'skb' in the case of a failure. This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion.
