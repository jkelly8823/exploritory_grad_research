VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the DI() instruction, which can lead to memory corruption and unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The DI() instruction is used to load a 16-bit immediate value into the destination register, but the immediate value is not checked for validity, allowing for potential buffer overflows.
