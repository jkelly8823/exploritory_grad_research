VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The variable hw->queues is assigned a value of 4, which is a small value. This value is then used as an index into the array hw->queues_tx_rx_queue_map. If the number of queues is greater than 4, the index will be out of bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.
