VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the lack of bounds checking on the wlan_idx variable. The function does not check if wlan_idx is within the valid range of 0 to MT76_N_WCIDS. If wlan_idx is greater than MT76_N_WCIDS, the function will access an out-of-bounds memory location.
