VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The variable names are not descriptive enough to understand their purpose.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use more descriptive variable names. For example, use "primary_abort_count" instead of "u8 primary_abort_count". Also, use "vf_api" instead of "unsigned int vf_api".
