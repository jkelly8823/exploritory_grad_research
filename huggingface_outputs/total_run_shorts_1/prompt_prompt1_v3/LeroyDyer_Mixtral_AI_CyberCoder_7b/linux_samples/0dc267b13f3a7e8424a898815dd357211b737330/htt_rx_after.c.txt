VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to ath10k_htt_rx_h_csum_offload() and ath10k_htt_rx_h_undecap() functions. The functions are called without checking the size of the msdu parameter, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the msdu size is larger than the buffer
