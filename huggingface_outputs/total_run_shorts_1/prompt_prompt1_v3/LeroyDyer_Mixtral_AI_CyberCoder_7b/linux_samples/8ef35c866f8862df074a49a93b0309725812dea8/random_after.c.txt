VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential race condition vulnerability in the numa_crng_init function. The function numa_crng_init() is called with a lock_init() call, but it is not clear if the lock is released before the call to kcalloc(). If the kcalloc() call fails, the code will continue executing without releasing the lock, which could
