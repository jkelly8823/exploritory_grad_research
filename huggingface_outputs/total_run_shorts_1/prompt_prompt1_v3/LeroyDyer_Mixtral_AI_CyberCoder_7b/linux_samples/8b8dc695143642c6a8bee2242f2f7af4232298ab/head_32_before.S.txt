VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `topphys()` function which does not check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer. This can lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer bounds, causing a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `topphys()` function copies the string pointed to by `r2` into
