VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of max_zone_pfns[ZONE_DMA]. The calculation of max_zone_pfn for ZONE_DMA is performed by shifting the max_low_pfn value by 20 bits, which could result in an integer overflow if max_low_pfn is greater than 1 << 20. This could
