VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `bl` instruction, which can lead to stack smashing.
EXPLANATION: The `bl` instruction is used to branch to a specific address, but it does not check the size of the argument passed to it. This can result in a buffer overflow if the argument is larger than the stack size.
