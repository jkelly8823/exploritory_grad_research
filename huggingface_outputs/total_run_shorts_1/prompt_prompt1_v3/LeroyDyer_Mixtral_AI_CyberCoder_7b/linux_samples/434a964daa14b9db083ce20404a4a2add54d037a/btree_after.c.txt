VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the if statement. The if statement checks if the value of HFS_I(tree->inode)->alloc_blocks is greater than HFS_I(tree->inode)->first_blocks, but it does not check if the value is less than or equal to the maximum number of blocks allowed. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the
