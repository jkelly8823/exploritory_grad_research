VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to memcpy() function. The function call does not check the size of the source buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the source buffer is larger than the size of the destination buffer.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a specified number of bytes from a source buffer to a destination buffer
