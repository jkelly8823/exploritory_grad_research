VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function kvm_vcpu_unmap. The function call to kvm_vcpu_mark_page_dirty() and kvm_release_pfn_dirty() does not check the size of the input parameters, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly sanitized.
