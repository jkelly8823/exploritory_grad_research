VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential vulnerability in the function check_flow_keys_access() where the access to flow keys is not checked for validity.
EXPLANATION: The code checks for invalid access to flow keys without checking if the access is valid. This could lead to unintended access to memory locations, which could result in a buffer overflow or memory corruption.
