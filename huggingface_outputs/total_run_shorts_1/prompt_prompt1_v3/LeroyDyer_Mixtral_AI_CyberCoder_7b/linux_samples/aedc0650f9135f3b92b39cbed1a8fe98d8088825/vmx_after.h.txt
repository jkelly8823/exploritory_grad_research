VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the definition of the variable nr. The variable nr is defined as an unsigned int, which limits its value to the range of 0 to 2^16 - 1. If the value of nr exceeds this range, it will wrap around and cause undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION: The variable nr is defined as an
