VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of a hardcoded constant value for the maximum number of nested guests. This value is hardcoded and cannot be changed dynamically, which could limit the number of nested virtual machines supported by the system.
EXPLANATION: The maximum number of nested virtual machines is hardcoded to 64, which could be a
