VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the struct kvm_resize_hpt function due to the use of an array with a fixed size. The array 'nested_guests' has a fixed size of KVM_MAX_NESTED_GUESTS, which may not be sufficient to handle all possible inputs. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the number of
