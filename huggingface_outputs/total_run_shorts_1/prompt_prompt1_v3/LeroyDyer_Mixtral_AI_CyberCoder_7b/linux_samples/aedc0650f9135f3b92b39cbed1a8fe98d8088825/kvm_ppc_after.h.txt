VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function prototype for store_to_eaddr() has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of an integer type for the size parameter. The size parameter should be a pointer to an integer to allow for larger memory allocations.
EXPLANATION: The function prototype for store_to_eaddr() has an integer type for the size parameter, which limits the maximum size to the maximum
