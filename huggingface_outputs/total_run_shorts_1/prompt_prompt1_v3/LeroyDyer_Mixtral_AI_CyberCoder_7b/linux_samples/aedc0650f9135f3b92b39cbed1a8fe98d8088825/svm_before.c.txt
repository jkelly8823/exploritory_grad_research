VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to the cpuid instruction. The cpuid instruction can write up to 16 bytes of data to the ECX register, but the variable entry->edx only has 4 bytes. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly sanitized.
