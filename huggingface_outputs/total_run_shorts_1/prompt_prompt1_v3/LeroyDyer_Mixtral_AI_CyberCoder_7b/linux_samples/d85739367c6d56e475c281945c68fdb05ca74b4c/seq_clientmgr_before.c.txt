VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The function call snd_seq_write_pool_allocated() may return a non-zero value if the buffer is full, but the if statement does not check for this case. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the function returns a non-zero value and the else statement is executed, which could result in memory corruption and a
