VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the use of MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_DENYWRITE | MAP_EXECUTABLE flags for memory mapping. This combination of flags can lead to a race condition where multiple processes can access and modify the same memory region concurrently, which can result in data corruption and unintended behavior.
