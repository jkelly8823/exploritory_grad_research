VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the line:
```c
	iov[0].iov_base = (void *)&ah;
```
This line allocates memory for the struct aunhdr variable and then assigns the address of the struct to the iov_base field of the first iovec structure. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow
