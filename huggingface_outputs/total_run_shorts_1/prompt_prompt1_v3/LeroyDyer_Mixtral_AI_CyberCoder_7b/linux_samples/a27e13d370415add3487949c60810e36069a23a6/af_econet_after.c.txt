VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function does not perform bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function copies a specified number of bytes from a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking if the source and destination buffers have sufficient space to hold the data. This can lead to buffer overflow
