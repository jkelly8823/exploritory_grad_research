VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function call to strcpy() can lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer bounds, potentially causing a stack overflow.
EXPLANATION: The use of strcpy() without bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, as it copies the entire string pointed to by the
