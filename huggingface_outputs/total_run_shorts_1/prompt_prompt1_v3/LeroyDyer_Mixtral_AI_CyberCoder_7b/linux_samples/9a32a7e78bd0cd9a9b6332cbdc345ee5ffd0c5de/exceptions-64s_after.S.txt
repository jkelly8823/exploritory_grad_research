VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the "std" instruction, which stores data into a buffer without checking its size. This can lead to overwriting memory beyond the buffer bounds, potentially causing a stack overflow and crashing the program.

EXPLANATION: The "std" instruction stores data into a memory location without checking the size of the buffer, which can lead
