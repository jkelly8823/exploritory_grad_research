VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strcmp() function which can lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The strcmp() function does not return the length of the strings being compared, so it is possible for the input to exceed the size of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
