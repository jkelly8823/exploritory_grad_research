VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the put_user_ex() function, which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the bounds of the frame->pretcode buffer.
EXPLANATION: The use of the put_user_ex() function without bounds checking can allow an attacker to write arbitrary data beyond the bounds of
