VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the split_huge_page_pmd() function which does not check the size of the input.
EXPLANATION: The split_huge_page_pmd() function is called without checking the size of the input, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer size.
