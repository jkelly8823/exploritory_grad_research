VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code checks if the user is root before allowing the ftrace function to be executed. However, it does not check if the user has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. This could allow a user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN to bypass the check and execute the function.
