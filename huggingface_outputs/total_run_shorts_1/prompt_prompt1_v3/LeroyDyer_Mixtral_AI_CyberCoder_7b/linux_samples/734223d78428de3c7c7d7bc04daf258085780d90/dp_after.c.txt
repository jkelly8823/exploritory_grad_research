VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic on a pointer to an array. The pointer arithmetic operation on rx_ring->rx_desc_list[i] may lead to a buffer overflow if the index i is out of bounds.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses pointer arithmetic to access the rx_desc_
