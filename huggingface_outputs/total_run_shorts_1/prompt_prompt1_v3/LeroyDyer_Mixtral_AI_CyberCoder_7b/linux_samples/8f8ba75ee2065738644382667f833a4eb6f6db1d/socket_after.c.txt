VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memset() can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability as it writes to a buffer without checking the size of the input.
EXPLANATION: The memset() function writes a specified number of bytes to a block of memory, but it does not check the size of the input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if
