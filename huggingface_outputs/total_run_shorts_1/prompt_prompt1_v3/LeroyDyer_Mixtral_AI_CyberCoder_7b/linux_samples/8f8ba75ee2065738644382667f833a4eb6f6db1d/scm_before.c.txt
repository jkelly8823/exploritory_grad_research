VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a loop variable i that is not properly initialized.
EXPLANATION: The variable i is incremented without being initialized, which can lead to undefined behavior and potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Initialize i before the loop to avoid undefined behavior and potential buffer overflow.
