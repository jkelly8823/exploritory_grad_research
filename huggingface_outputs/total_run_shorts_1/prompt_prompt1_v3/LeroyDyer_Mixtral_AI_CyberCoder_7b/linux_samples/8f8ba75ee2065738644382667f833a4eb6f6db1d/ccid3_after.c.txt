VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memset() with a size of 0 can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The memset() function is used to clear the memory at the address pointed to by tfrc with 0 bytes, which is not enough to cover the entire structure. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
