VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the macro "rcu_read_lock()" which is a synchronization primitive that is not recommended for use in multithreaded code. It is recommended to use mutex_lock() or mutex_lock() instead. The use of "rcu_read_lock()" can lead to deadlocks and other synchron
