VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the use of rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() functions. These functions are used to protect critical sections of code that access shared data structures. However, they are not sufficient to protect against all possible race conditions. It is recommended to use mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() instead for more robust synchronization
