VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer for the sockaddr_atmpvc structure. The size of the buffer is not checked against the actual size of the structure, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using a fixed-size buffer for the sockaddr_atmpvc structure without checking its actual
