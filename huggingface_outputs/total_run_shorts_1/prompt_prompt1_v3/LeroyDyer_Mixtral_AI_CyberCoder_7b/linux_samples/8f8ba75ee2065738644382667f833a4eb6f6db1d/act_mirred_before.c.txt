VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The code snippet checks the return value of a function call (err) and then increments a counter (m->tcf_qstats.overlimits) if the function call fails. This could lead to a race condition where the counter is incremented even if the function call succeeds. This could lead to incorrect counting of errors.
