VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic on a pointer to a struct without bounds checking. The pointer is dereferenced without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code dereferences a pointer to a struct without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The struct is not checked for size before dereferencing it.
