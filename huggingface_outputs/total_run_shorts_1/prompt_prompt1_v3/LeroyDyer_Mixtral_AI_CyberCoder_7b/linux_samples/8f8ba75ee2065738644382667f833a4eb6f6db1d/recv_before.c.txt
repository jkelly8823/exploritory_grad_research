VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the variable 'tsf_lower' due to the bitwise AND operation with 0xffffffff. This operation will truncate the lower 32 bits of the tsf variable, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The bitwise AND operation between 'tsf' and 0xffffffff will result
