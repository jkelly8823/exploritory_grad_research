VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The mutex_lock() function is used without checking the size of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The mutex_lock() function does not check the size of the buffer, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe mutex_lock_exact() function instead, which checks the
