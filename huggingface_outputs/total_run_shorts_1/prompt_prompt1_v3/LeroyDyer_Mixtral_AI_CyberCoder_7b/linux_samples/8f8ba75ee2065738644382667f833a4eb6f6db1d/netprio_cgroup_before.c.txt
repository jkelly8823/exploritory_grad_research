VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function call to kzalloc() does not check the size of the allocated memory, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the allocated memory.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function allocates memory without checking the size of the
