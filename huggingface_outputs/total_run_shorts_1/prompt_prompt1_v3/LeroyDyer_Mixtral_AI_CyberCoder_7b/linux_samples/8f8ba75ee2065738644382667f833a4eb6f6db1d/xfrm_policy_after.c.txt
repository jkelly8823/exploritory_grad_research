VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memset() can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability as it writes to a buffer without checking the size of the dst pointer.
EXPLANATION: The memset() function writes a specified number of bytes to a block of memory. If the dst pointer points to a buffer that is too small, it can lead to a buffer
