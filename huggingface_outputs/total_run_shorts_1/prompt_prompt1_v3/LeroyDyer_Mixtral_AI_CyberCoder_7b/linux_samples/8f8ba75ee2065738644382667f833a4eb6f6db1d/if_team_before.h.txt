VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the sizeof() function on a pointer to a struct. The sizeof() function returns the size of the memory occupied by the pointer, not the size of the struct. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the struct is not properly initialized.

EXPLANATION: The sizeof() function is used to determine the size of
