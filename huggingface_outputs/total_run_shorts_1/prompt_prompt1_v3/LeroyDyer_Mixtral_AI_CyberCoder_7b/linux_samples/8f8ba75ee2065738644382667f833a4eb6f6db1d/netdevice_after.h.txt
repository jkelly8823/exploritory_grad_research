VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the ndo_poll_controller function due to the use of a pointer without bounds checking. The function call to ndo_poll_controller may pass a pointer to a buffer that is not checked for size, allowing a potential attacker to pass a larger buffer than the expected size, leading to a buffer overflow.
