VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflows vulnerability in the bitwise AND operation. The bitwise AND operator can result in unexpected behavior if the operands have different sizes.
EXPLANATION: The bitwise AND operator can result in unexpected behavior if the operands have different sizes. In this case, the left-hand operand is a 64-bit unsigned integer, while
