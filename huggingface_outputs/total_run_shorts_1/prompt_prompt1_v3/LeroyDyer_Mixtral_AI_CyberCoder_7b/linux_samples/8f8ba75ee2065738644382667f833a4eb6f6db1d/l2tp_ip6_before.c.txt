VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to an array. The pointer arithmetic operation on lsa->l2tp_family can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses pointer arithmetic to access an array element, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the pointer
