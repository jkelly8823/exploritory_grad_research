VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the min_t() function, which does not check the length of the input data.
EXPLANATION: The min_t() function is used to copy data from user space to kernel space without checking the length of the input data, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method
