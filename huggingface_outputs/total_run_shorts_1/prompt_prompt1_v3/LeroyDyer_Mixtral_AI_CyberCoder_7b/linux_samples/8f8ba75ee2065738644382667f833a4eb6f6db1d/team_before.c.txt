VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential memory leak due to the use of kzalloc() which does not return memory on failure.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function allocates memory and initializes it to zero, but it does not return the memory if an error occurs. If the call to __netpoll_setup() fails, the memory allocated for np will not be freed,
