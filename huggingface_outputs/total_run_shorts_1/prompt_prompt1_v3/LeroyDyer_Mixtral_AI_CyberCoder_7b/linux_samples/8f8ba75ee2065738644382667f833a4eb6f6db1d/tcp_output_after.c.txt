VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of bitwise AND operator on a constant value and a variable. The constant value is 1UL << TCP_TSQ_DEFERRED, which is a left shift operation that shifts the bits to the left by 1 position. This operation can result in an integer overflow, leading to a potential buffer overflow if the variable is
