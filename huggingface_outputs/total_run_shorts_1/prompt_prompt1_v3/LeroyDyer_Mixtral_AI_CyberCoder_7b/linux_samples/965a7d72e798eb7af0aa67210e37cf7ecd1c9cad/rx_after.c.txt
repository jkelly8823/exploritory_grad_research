VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the memcpy function call. The memcpy function is used to copy a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer. This could lead to overwriting memory beyond the end of the destination buffer, which could result in a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy function copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without
