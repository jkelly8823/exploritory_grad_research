VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the variable 'load_bias' due to the absence of bounds checking when calculating the value of 'load_bias'. The calculation of 'load_bias' is not properly checked against the size of the ELF file, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly sanitized.
