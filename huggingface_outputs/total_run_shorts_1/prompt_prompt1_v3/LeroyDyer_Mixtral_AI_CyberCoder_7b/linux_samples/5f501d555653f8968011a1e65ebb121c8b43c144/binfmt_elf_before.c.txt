VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of load_bias. The calculation of load_bias is not properly checked against the size of the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE, which could lead to an out-of-bounds memory access.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet calculates load_bias based on the value of vaddr and elf_
