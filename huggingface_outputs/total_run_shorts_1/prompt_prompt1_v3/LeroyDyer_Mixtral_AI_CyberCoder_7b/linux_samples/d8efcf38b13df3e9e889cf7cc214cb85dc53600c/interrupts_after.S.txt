VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the implementation of the hyp_get_vectors function, where a return value of 0xffffffff is used to indicate a special case. This could be exploited by an attacker to bypass the check and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet demonstrates a potential security vulnerability where a return value of
