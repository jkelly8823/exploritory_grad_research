VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 5-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable base_addr is assigned a value from iterator.addr, which is an unsigned integer, and then bitwise ANDed with PT64_LVL_ADDR_MASK(iterator.level), which is a constant. This operation can result in
