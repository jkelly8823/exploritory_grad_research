VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 5-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of base_addr. The calculation of base_addr is performed without checking the value of iterator.level, which could lead to an integer overflow if iterator.level is a large value. This could result in a buffer overflow if the value of iterator
