VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call (*gwj->mod.modfunc[modidx])(cf, &gwj->mod);. The function call does not check the size of the argument passed to it, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the argument is larger than the size of the structure.
