VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the offsetof() function without bounds checking. The offsetof() function calculates the offset of a member within a structure, but it does not check whether the structure is valid or whether the offset is within the structure's bounds. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the structure is not properly initialized or if the structure is not aligned
