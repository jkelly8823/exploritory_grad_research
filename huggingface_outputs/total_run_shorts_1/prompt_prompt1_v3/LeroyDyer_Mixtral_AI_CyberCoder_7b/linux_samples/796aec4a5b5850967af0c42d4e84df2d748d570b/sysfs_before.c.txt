VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the sysfs_emit function which does not check the length of the output string.
EXPLANATION: The sysfs_emit function is used to write data to a sysfs file, but it does not check the length of the output string, which could lead to buffer overflow if the output string is longer than the
