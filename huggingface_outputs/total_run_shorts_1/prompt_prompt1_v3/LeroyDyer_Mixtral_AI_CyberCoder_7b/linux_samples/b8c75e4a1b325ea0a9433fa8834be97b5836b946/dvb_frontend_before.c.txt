VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential race condition vulnerability due to the use of the wait_event_interruptible() function, which can lead to a deadlock if the function is called with the O_NONBLOCK flag set and the event queue is empty.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the event queue is empty before calling wait_event_interruptible(), which could
