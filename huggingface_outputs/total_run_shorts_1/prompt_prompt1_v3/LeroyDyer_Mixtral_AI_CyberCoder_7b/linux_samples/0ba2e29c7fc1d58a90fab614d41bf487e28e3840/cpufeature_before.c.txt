VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows. The function returns a boolean value based on the result of a comparison between two unsigned integers. If the result of the comparison is greater than the maximum value of an unsigned integer, the result will wrap around to a negative value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities
