VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function call to strcpy() can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The use of strcpy() without bounds checking can lead to
