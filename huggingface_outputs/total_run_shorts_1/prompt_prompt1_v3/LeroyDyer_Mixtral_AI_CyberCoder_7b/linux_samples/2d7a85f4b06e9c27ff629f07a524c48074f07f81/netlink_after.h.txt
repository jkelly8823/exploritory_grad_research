VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the size of the struct netlink_skb_parms.
EXPLANATION: The struct netlink_skb_parms does not have any bounds checking on the size of the creds field, which could lead to buffer overflow if the size of the creds structure is not properly initialized or allocated.
