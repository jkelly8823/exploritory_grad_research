VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function call to memcpy_fromiovec() is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call does not check the size of the input buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the output buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy_fromiovec() function copies data from an input buffer to an output buffer without checking the size of the output buffer.
