VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential race condition vulnerability. The spin_lock_irq() and spin_unlock_irq() calls are used to synchronize access to the hash_locks array, but the mutex_trylock() call on conf->cache_size_mutex is not guaranteed to acquire the lock. This could lead to a data race between the two critical sections, allowing a
