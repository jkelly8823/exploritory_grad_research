VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to race conditions. The function is not checking if the pipe->ar_usb is initialized before accessing it. If the pipe->ar_usb is not initialized, the code may crash or behave unpredictably.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check before accessing pipe->ar_usb to ensure it is initialized. Use a conditional statement
