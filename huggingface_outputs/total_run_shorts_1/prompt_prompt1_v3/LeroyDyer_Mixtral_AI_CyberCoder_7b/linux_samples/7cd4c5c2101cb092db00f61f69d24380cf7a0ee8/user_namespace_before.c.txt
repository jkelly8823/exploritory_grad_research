VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the kmem_cache_zalloc() function, which does not check the size of the allocated memory. This function allocates memory from the kernel's slab cache, but it does not perform bounds checking on the size of the requested memory. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a large
