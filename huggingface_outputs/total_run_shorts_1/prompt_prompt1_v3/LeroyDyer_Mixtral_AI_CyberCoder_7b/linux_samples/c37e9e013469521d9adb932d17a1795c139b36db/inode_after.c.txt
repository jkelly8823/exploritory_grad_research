VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the calculation of iloc->block_group. The calculation of iloc->block_group is vulnerable to integer overflows because it divides by EXT4_INODES_PER_GROUP(sb) which is a constant value. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of inode->i_ino is larger than the
