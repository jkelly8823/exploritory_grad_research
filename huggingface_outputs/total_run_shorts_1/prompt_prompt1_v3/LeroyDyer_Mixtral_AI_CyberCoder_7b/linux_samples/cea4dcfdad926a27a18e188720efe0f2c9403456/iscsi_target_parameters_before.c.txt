VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strncpy() function without checking the length of the input string.
EXPLANATION:
The strncpy() function copies a string into a buffer, up to the specified number of characters. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, it can lead to buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption and
