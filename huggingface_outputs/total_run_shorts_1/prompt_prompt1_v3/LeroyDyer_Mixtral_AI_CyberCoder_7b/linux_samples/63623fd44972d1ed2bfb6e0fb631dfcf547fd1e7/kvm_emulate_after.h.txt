VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the struct operand src and src2. The struct operand is not properly initialized, which could lead to memory corruption and unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The struct operand is not properly initialized, which could lead to buffer overflow and memory corruption. The struct is used without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite memory
