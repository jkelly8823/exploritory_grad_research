VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the size of the fastop_t structure. The calculation of the size of the structure is done without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the structure is larger than the allocated memory.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of the size of the fastop_t structure is done without bounds checking
