VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function call to fastop() does not include any bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to pass a larger input than the buffer size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines a function call to fastop() without
