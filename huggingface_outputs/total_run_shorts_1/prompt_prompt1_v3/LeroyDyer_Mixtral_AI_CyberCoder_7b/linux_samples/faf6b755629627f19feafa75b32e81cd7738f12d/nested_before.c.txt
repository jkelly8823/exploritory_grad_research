VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the assignment of the control.int_ctl_vmcb12_bits variable. The assignment of the value of svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl to svm->vmcb->control.int_ctl could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl is larger than the
