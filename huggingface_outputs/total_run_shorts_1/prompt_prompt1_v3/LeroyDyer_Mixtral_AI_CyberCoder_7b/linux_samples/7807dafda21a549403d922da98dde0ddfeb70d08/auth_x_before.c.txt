VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows. The arithmetic operation on the variable 'ret' in the if statement can result in integer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The if statement checks if 'ret' is less than 0, which can lead to integer overflows. The result of the operation can be larger than the maximum value of an integer, causing un
