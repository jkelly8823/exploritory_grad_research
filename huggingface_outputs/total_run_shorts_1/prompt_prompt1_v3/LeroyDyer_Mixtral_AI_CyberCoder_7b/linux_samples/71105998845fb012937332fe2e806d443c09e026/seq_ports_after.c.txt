VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to race conditions due to the lack of synchronization when adding a new port to the client's list of ports. The use of mutex_lock() and write_lock_irqsave()/write_unlock_irqrestore() does not provide sufficient synchronization for concurrent access to the list_add_tail() function, which could lead to data races and
