VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `SetModeFlag` function which does not check the size of the input parameter. This function may accept a larger input than its buffer can handle, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function call to `SetModeFlag` should be replaced with
