VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the __get_user() function, which does not check the size of the input data.
EXPLANATION:
The __get_user() function is used to read unsigned integers from user space into kernel space without checking the size of the input data, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
