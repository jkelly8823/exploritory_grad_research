VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The scratch_len variable is not checked against the size of the scratch array, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated size.

EXPLANATION: The scratch_len variable is used to store the length of the parsed string,
