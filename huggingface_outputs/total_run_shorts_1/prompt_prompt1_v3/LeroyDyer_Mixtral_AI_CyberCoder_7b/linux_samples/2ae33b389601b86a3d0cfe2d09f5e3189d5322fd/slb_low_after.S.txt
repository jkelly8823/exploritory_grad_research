VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the ESID value. The calculation of the ESID value in the line "srdi r10,r3,SID_SHIFT" could result in an integer overflow if the value of r3 is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by the signed 16-bit register. This could lead to
