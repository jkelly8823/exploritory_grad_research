VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the function call to of_get_gpio() and irq_of_parse_and_map() without bounds checking. These functions can return a pointer to a buffer that is larger than the size of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.
