VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `stm` instruction, which stores the value of register %r15 into the stack memory without checking the stack pointer. This could lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations and potentially corrupting the stack frame.

EXPLANATION: The `stm` instruction stores the value of register %r15
