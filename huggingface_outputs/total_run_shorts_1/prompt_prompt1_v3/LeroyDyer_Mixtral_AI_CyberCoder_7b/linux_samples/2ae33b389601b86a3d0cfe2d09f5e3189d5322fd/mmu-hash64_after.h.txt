VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the VSID_MULTIPLIER_256M and VSID_MODULUS_256M constants. The use of ASM_CONST() macro to set the values of these constants may lead to integer overflows, which could result in incorrect values for the multiplication and modulo operations.
