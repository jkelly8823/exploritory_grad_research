VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the use of the return statement. The return statement is used in multiple places, but it is not clear if it is intended to exit the function or if it is a conditional statement. It is recommended to use the appropriate control flow statements such as if-else or switch-case statements to ensure proper handling of errors.
