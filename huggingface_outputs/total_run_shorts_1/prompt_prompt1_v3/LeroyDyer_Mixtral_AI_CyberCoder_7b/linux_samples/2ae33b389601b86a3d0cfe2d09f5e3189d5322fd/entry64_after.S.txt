VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `stmg` instruction, which stores a value into a memory location without checking the size of the data being written. This could lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations and cause unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `stmg` instruction stores a value into a memory location, but does not check the
