VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the offset for accessing the PCI BARs. The calculation of the offset for accessing the PCI BARs is done by multiplying the BAR index by 4 and adding it to the base address of the PCI capability structure. However, the BAR index is an unsigned integer, which can result in an integer overflow if it
