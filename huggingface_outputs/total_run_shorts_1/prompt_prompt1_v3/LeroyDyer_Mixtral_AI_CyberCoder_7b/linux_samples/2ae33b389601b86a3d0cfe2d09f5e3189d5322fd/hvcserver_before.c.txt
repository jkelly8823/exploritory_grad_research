VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strncpy() function without bounds checking. The function strncpy() copies a string into a buffer until the null terminator is reached or the specified number of characters is reached, whichever comes first. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, it can lead to buffer overflow.
