VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function nv50_display_flip_next() due to the use of bitwise operations on the offset variable without bounds checking. The use of bitwise operators on unsigned integers can lead to integer overflows, which can result in unexpected behavior and potential buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The use of bitwise operators
