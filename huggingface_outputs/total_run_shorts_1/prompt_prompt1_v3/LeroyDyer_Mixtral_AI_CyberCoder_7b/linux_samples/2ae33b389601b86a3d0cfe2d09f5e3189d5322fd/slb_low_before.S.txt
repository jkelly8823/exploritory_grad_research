VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the offset value for the user address. The calculation of the offset value is done by shifting the user ESID by 12 bits, which could result in an integer overflow if the ESID is greater than 4095. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the user address is not within the user region.
