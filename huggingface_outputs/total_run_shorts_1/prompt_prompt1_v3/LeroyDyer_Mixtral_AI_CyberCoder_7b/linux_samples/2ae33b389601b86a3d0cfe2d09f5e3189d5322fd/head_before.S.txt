VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the str instruction on line 1. The str instruction is used to store the value of r3 into the memory location pointed by r0, but it does not check the size of the memory location before writing. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of r3 is larger than the size of the memory location.
