VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function omap_mux_get_by_name() due to the use of the strcpy() function without bounds checking. The strcpy() function copies the input string into the destination buffer without checking the length of the input string, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
