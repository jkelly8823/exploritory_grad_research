VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the if statement without bounds checking on the input variable voltage.
EXPLANATION: The if statement does not include any bounds checking on the input variable voltage, which could potentially allow a malicious actor to pass a value outside of the expected range, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input
