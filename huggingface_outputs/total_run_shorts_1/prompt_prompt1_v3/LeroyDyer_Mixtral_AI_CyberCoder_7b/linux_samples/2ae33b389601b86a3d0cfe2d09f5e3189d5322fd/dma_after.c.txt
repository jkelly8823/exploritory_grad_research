VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the slot variable.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if slot is within the valid range of EDMA_MAX_SLOTS before performing the bitwise operation. An attacker could potentially pass an invalid slot value to overwrite memory outside of the EDMA_MAX_SLOTS range, leading to
