VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines three constants, ALPS_PROTO_V2, ALPS_PROTO_V3, and ALPS_PROTO_V4, but it does not include any access control or input validation. This could allow an attacker to potentially manipulate the values of these constants and cause unintended behavior.
