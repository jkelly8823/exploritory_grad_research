VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the declaration of the sigset_t variable. The variable is declared as an array of 1024 bytes, but the size of sigset_t is 128 bytes. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of sigset_t is larger
