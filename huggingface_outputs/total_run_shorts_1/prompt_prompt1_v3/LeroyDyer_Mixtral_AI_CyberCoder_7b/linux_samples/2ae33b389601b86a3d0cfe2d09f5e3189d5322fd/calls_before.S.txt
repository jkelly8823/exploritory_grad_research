VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the sys_process_vm_writev function call.
EXPLANATION: The sys_process_vm_writev function call is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the absence of bounds checking on the input data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation and bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks. Use a safe buffer size and
