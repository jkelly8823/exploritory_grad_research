VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the macro definition of BITOP_LE_SWIZZLE. The macro uses a bitwise AND operation between the constant value (BITS_PER_LONG-1) and the bitmask (~0x7), which could result in an integer overflow if BITS_PER_LONG is larger than 32 bits. This could lead to un
