VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential race condition vulnerability in the check_and_switch_context function. The function checks the ASID value against the current generation using a bitwise XOR operation, which may not be atomic. This could lead to a data race if the ASID value is modified concurrently by another thread.
EXPLANATION: The XOR operation is not atomic, so there
