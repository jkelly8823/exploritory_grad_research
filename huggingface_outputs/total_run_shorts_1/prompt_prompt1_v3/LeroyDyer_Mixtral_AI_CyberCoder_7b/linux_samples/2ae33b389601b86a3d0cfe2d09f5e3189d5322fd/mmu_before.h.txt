VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the definition of the mm_context_t struct. The use of an unsigned int for the vmalloc_seq field can lead to integer overflows, which can result in unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION: The use of an unsigned int for the vmalloc_seq field limits the range of values that can
