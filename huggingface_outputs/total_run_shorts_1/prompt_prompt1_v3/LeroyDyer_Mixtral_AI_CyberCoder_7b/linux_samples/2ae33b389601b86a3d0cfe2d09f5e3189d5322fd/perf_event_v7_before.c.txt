VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code uses bitwise AND operator to combine two constants, which may result in unexpected behavior if the constants have overlapping bits.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a bitwise OR operator instead of AND to combine the constants.

The code defines two constants, ARMV7_EVTYPE_MASK and ARMV7_EVTYPE_EVENT, and then uses a bitwise AND operator to
