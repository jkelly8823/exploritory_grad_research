VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable without bounds checking. The variable 'result' is returned without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'result' is returned without bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to potentially overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability
