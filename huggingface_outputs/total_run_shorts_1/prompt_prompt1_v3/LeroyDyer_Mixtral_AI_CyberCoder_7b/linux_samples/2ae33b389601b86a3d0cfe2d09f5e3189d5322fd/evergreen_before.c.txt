VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of the bitwise AND operator (&) on two variables without checking for the possibility of a zero value. This could lead to undefined behavior if the L2_BUSY variable is zero.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if L2_BUSY is set and then performs a bitwise AND operation with RADE
