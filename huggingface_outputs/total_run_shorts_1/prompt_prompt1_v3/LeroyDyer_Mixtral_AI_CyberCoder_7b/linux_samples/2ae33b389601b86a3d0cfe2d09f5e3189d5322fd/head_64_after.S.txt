VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to the strncpy function. The function call does not include a length check, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The strncpy function is used to copy a string into a buffer without checking the length of the source string, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the buffer
