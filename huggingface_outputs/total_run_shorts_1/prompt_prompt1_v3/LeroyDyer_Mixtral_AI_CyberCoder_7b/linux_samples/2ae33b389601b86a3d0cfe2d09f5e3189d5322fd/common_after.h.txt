VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function names are not descriptive enough to understand what they do. It is not clear what the functions do without reading the documentation.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The function names should be more descriptive and self-explanatory. For example, omap3630_init_late() should be renamed to something like omap3630_init_late
