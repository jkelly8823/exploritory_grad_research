VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function alps_process_touchpad_packet_v3() due to the use of the bitwise AND operator on a pointer variable f->y_map without checking the size of the pointer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the pointer is not properly initialized or if the size of the pointer is larger than the size of the
