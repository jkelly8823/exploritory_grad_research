VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code uses a conditional statement to determine whether the address is in kernel space or user space. If the address is in kernel space, it uses the user_segment_size() function to get the segment size. If the address is in user space, it uses the get_kernel_vsid() function to get the virtual segment size. The WARN_ON() statement checks if the virtual segment
