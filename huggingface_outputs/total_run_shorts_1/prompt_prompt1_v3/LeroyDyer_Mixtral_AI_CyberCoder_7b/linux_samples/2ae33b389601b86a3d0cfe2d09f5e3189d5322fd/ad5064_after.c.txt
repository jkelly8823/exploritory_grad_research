VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function ad5064_sync_powerdown_mode() due to the use of the << operator on an unsigned int variable. The << operator shifts the bits to the left and fills the leftmost bits with zeros, which could result in a buffer overflow if the input value is larger than the maximum value of an unsigned int
