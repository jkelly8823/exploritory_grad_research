VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4, 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function call to compat_sys_fallocate() is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call does not check the length of the input parameters, allowing a potential attacker to pass a large value for the length of the file to be allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
