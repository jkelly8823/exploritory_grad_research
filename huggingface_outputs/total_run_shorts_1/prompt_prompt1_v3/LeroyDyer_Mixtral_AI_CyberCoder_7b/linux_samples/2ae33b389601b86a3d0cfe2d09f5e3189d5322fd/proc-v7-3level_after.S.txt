VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the ASID value. The shift operation on the ASID value may result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value being stored in the TTB register.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks the value of the ASID against a constant value using a comparison instruction (slt) and then shifts
