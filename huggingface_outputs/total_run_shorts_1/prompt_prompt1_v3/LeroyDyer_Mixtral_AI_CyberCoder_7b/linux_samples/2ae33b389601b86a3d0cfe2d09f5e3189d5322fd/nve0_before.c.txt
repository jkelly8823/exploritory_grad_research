VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the nv_wr32() function, which writes 32-bit values to memory without bounds checking. This could lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations and cause unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The nv_wr32() function writes 32-bit values to memory without bounds checking,
