VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to use-after-free race condition. The variable 'port' is not properly synchronized, which can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet releases the resource 'port' without synchronization, which can lead to a use-after-free race condition. The 'port' pointer may still be used after the resource is freed
