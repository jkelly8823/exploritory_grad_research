VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the sys_process_vm_writev function call.
EXPLANATION: The sys_process_vm_writev function call does not include a proper bounds check on the input buffer, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite memory beyond the buffer bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement input validation and bounds checking to prevent buffer
