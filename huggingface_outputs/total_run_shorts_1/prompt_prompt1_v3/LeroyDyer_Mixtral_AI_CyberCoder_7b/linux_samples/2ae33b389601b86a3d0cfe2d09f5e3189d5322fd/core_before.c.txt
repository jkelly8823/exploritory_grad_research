VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to race conditions due to the lack of synchronization when checking if a RNG with the same name already exists in the list. The mutex lock is used to protect the list access, but it is not used consistently throughout the code.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if a RNG with the same name already exists in the list before registering a new RNG,
