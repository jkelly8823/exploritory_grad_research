VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable surf.base_align is subtracted from moffset, which could lead to a buffer overflow if surf.base_align is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a signed integer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if surf.base_align is larger than moffset, but it is not
