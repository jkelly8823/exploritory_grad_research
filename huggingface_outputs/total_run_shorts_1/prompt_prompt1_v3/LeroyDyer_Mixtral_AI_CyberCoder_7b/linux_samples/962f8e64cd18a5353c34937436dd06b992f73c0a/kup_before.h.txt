VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to the function `allow_user_access()` due to the absence of bounds checking on the size parameter. The function call does not include any bounds checking on the size parameter, which could allow a malicious user to pass a larger value than the actual size of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
