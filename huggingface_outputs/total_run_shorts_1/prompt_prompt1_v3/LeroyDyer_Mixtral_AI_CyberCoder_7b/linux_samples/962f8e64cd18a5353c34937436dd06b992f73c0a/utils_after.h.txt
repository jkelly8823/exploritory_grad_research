VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the perf_event_disable() and perf_event_reset() functions, which do not include bounds checking on the input parameters.

EXPLANATION: The perf_event_disable() and perf_event_reset() functions do not perform bounds checking on the input parameters, which could allow an attacker to pass invalid
