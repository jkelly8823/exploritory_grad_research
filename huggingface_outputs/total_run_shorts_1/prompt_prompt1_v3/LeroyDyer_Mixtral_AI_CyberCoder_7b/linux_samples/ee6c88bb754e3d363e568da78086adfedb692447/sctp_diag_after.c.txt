VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The memcpy function copies data from the source to the destination until the number of bytes specified by the count argument. If the source data is larger than the destination buffer, it can lead to buffer overflow. The destination buffer is not checked for size, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy function copies
