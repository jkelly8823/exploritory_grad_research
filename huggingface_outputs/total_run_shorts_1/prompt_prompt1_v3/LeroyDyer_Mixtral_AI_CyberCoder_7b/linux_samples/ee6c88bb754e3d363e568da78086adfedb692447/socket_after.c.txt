VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call memcpy() is used to copy data from the source buffer to the destination buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a block of memory from the source buffer to the destination buffer without checking if the destination
