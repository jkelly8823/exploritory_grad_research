VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function vgacon_resize() has a potential vulnerability in the if statement on line 10. The function checks if the width and height parameters are within the bounds of the screen size. However, it does not check if the width and height are both positive integers. This could allow for a malicious actor to pass in negative values, which could lead to undefined behavior or a buffer overflow
