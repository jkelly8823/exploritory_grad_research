VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `get_dumpable()` function, which is a function that returns a value indicating whether the current process is a dumpable process. The function is called twice without checking its return value, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the function returns a non
