VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the gpte variable. The calculation of gpte is performed using bitwise operations, which could result in an integer overflow if the level variable is larger than the maximum value of the PT_PAGE_TABLE_LEVEL constant. This could lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
