VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to PT_INDEX() may lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The PT_INDEX() function call may return a value that is larger than the size of the array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use bounds checking to ensure that the index is within the valid range of the array.
