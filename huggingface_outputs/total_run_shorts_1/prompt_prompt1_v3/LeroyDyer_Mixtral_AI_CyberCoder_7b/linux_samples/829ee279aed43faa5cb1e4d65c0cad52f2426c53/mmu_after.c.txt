VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the gpte variable. The calculation of gpte = level - mmu->last_nonleaf_level and gpte |= level - PT_PAGE_TABLE_LEVEL - 1 could lead to integer overflows if the values of level and mmu->last_nonleaf_level are not carefully checked. This could
