VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the call to the mmap() function. The function call to mmap() does not check the size of the input parameter, which could allow an attacker to pass a larger-than-expected value, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The mmap() function call does not include a size check, which could allow
