VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of kzalloc() which does not check the size of the allocated memory.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function does not check the size of the allocated memory, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the allocated memory is too large. This could result in memory corruption and potential security
