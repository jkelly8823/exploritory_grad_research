VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to privilege escalation via the use of the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability. The code checks if the user has the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability, which is a powerful capability that allows the user to load and unload kernel modules. This can be exploited by an attacker to load arbitrary kernel modules, which can lead to privilege escalation.
