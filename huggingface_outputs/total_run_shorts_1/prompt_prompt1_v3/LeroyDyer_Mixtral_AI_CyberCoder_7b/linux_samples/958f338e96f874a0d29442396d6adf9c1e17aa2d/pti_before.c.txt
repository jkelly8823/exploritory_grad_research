VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the format string function printf without bounds checking on the input string.
EXPLANATION: The format string function printf is used without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer alternative such as snprintf or format-safe functions like vprintf to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
