VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to insert_pfn() and remap_pmd_range() functions. The function calls do not check the size of the input parameters, which could allow an attacker to pass a large input value to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains function calls to insert
