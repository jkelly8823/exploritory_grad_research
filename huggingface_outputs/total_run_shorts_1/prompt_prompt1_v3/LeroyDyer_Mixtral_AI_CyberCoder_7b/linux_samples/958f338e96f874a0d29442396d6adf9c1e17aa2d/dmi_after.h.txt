VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the malloc() function without bounds checking. The malloc() function does not perform bounds checking, so it can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The malloc() function does not perform bounds checking, which means that it
