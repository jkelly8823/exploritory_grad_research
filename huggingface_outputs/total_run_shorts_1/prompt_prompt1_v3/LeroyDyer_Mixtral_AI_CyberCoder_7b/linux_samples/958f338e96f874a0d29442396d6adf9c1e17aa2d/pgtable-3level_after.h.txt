VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the __pteval_entry() macro, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The macro shifts the value of the type by 64 bits, which could result in an integer overflow if the input value is larger than the maximum representable value. This could lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption.

EXPLANATION: The macro shifts the
