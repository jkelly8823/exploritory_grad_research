VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the definition of the macro __swp_entry_to_pte. The macro uses a bitwise shift operation on the value of a variable without checking if the value is within the valid range. This could lead to an integer overflow if the input value is too large, resulting in an incorrect value being assigned to the pte_val field.
