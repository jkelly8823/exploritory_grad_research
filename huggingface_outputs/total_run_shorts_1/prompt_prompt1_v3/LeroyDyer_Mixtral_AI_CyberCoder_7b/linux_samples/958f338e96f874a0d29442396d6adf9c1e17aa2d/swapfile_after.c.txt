VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function max_swapfile_size() returns the maximum size of a swap file, which is calculated by creating a swap entry with a swap type of 0 and a swap offset of ~0UL, decoding it to a swap_entry_t, and then extracting the swap offset. This approach may not be sufficient to determine the maximum size for all architectures, as it only considers the
