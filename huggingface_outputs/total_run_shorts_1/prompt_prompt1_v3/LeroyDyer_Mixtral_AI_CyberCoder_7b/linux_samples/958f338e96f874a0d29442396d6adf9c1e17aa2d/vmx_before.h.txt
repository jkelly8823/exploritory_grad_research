VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function call to strcpy() is insecure as it does not check the length of the input string, which can lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function call to strcpy() does not check the length of the input string, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The input string is directly copied into the buffer without
