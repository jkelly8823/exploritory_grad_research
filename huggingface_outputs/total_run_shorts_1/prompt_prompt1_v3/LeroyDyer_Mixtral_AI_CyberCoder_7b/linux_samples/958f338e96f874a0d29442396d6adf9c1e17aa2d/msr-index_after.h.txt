VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines the constant ARCH_CAP_SKIP_VMENTRY_L1DFLUSH, which is a bitmask that indicates whether the processor supports skipping L1D flush on vmentry. This is a feature that can be exploited by attackers to bypass the L1D cache flush, which can lead to a vulnerability known as Speculative Store Bypass.
