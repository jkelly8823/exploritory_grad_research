VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The division operation on line 10 may result in an integer overflow, which could lead to incorrect values being used in the calculation of the standard deviation.
EXPLANATION: The division operation on line 10 divides by the number of samples (rec->counter) which is an unsigned integer. If the number of samples is
