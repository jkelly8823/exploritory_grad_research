VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a while(true) loop without a termination condition. This could lead to an infinite loop and a potential denial of service attack.
EXPLANATION: The while(true) loop can cause the system to become unresponsive and crash, allowing an attacker to potentially exploit the system.
