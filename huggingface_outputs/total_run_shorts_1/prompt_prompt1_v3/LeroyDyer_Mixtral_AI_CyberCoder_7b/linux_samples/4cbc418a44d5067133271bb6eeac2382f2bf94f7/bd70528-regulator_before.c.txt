VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to regulator_set_voltage_sel_regmap() and regulator_get_voltage_sel_regmap() functions. These functions are not checked for input length, which could allow an attacker to pass a large input to the function and potentially overwrite memory.
EXPLANATION: The code
