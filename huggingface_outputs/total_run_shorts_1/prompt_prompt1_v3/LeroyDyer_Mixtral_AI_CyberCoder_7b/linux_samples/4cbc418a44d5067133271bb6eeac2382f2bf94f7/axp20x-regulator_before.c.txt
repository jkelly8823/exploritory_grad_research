VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The variable i is incremented without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not validated.
EXPLANATION: The variable i is incremented without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not validated. The loop condition is checked after the increment, which means that if the input is
