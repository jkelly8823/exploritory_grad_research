VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains several macros that define the validity of page table entries (PTEs) based on the presence of specific bits in the PTE. The macros check for the presence of specific bits in the PTE to determine if it is valid, dirty, user, or writeable. The macros do not include checks for other attributes such as readability or executability.
