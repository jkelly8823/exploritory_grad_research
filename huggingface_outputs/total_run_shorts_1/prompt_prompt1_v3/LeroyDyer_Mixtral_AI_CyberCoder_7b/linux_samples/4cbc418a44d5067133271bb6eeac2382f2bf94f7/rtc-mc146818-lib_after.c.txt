VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the CMOS_WRITE function, which does not include bounds checking on the input parameters.
EXPLANATION: The CMOS_WRITE function is used to write data to the CMOS memory without any bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflows if the input parameters are not properly validated. This could result
