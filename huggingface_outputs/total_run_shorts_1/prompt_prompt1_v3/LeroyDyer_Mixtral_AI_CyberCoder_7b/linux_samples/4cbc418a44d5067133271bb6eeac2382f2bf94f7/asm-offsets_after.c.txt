VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the sizeof() function on a structure. The sizeof() function returns the size of the structure in bytes, but it does not account for the size of the alignment padding. This can lead to incorrect alignment of the structure members and cause buffer overflows.

EXPLANATION: The sizeof() function returns the size of the structure
