VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflows vulnerability in the pte_dirty() function. The function checks if the pte_sw_dirty(pte) and pte_hw_dirty(pte) flags are set, but it does not check for buffer overflow or input validation. This could lead to a potential integer overflows if the input is not properly sanitized.
