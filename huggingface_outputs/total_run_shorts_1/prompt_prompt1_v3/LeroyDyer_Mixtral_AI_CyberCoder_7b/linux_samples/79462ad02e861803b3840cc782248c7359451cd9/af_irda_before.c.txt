VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on a pointer to a structure. The pointer arithmetic operation can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses pointer arithmetic to access the next element in the array, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The correct way to access the next
