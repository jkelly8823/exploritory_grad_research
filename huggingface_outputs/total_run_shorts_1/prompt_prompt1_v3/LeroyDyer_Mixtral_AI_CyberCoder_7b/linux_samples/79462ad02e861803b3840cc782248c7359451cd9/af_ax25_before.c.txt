VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic on a pointer to an array. The pointer arithmetic operation on sock->type may lead to memory corruption.
EXPLANATION: The code uses pointer arithmetic on a pointer to an array, which can lead to memory corruption and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The correct way to access array elements is to use
