VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the input before copying it into the buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a dynamic buffer or implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow.
