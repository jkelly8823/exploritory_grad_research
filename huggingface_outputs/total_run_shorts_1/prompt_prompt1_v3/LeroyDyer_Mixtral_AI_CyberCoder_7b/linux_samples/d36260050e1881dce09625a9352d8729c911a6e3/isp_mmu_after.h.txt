VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function call to get_pd_base() is not checked for NULL pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that mmu is not NULL before dereferencing it.

The function call to get_pd_base() is not checked for NULL pointer. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which can cause undefined behavior and a potential security vulnerability.
