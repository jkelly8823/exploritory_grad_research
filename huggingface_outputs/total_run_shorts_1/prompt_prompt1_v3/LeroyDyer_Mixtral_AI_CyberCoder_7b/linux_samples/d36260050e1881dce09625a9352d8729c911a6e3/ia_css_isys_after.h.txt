VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of undefined macros. The macros USE_INPUT_SYSTEM_VERSION_2 and USE_INPUT_SYSTEM_VERSION_2401 are used to conditionally compile different code based on the version of the input system. However, the code snippet does not define these macros, which could lead to undefined behavior or errors
