VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a single call to imx274_write_reg() without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The function imx274_write_reg() may return an error, but the code does not check its return value. If the function returns an error, the dev_err() call will not be executed
