VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the mask value. The mask value is calculated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the constant MERR_VALID_PTE_MASK and the value 0x80000000, which could result in an integer overflow if the constant is larger than the mask. This could lead to unintended
