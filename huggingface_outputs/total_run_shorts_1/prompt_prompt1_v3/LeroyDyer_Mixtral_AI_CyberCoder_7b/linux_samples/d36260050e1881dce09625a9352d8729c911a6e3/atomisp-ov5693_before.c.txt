VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the if statement. The comparison between data_length and the constant values OV5693_8BIT and OV5693_16BIT may lead to integer overflows if the data_length variable is larger than the maximum value of a signed integer. This could result in unintended behavior and potential security vulner
