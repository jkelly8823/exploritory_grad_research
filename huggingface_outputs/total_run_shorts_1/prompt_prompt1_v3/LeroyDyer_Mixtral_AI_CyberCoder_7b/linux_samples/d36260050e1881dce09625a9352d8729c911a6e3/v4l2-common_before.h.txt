VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The sizeof() function returns the size of a variable in bytes, but the comparison is done with u32, which is 32-bit unsigned integer. This can lead to incorrect results if the size of the struct is larger than 32 bits.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks the size of the struct
