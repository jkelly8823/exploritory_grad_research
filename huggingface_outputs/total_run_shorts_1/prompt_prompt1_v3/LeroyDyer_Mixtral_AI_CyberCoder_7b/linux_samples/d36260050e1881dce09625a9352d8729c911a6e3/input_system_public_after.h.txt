VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function names and comments indicate that these functions are used to control the state of the receiver, but the implementation is not shown. The functions are not documented with the exact actions they perform. This makes it difficult to understand what they do and how they interact with the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Add comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function, and include the code that implements the functionality
