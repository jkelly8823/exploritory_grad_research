VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array. The array buffer_type_to_queue_id_map is of size SH_CSS_MAX_SP_THREADS * SH_CSS_MAX_NUM_QUEUES, which may not be sufficient to store all possible values of thread_id and buf_type. This could
