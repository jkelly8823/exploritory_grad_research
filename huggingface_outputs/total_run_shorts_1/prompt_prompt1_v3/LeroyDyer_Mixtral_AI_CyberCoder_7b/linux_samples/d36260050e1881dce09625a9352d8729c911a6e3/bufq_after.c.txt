VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array. The array buffer_type_to_queue_id_map is of a fixed size, which can lead to buffer overflow if the number of buffer types exceeds the maximum number of buffer types.
EXPLANATION:
The array buffer_type_to_queue_id_
