VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function sh_get_pd_base() has a potential vulnerability due to the use of the macro MERR_VALID_PTE_MASK, which is defined as 0x80000000. This constant value may not be sufficient to cover all possible valid physical addresses, leaving the system open to potential out-of-bounds accesses.
