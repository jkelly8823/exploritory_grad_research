VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of odd_line_bytes and even_line_bytes. The calculation of odd_line_bytes and even_line_bytes may result in integer overflows if the input width_padded is large enough.

EXPLANATION: The calculation of odd_line_bytes and even_line_bytes may result
