VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function call to resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode() is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function does not check the size of the input parameter resizer->config before passing it to resizer_configure_in_continuous_mode() or config_rsz_hw(). This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input is not properly sanitized.
