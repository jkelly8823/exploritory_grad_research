VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the ia_css_util_input_format_bpp function. The function takes an enum value as an argument, which could potentially be used to pass an integer value that is larger than the maximum value for the enum type. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the function does not properly check the input value.
