VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the if statement. The comparison between two integer variables (pipe->num_inputs and 1) could lead to unexpected behavior if the value of pipe->num_inputs is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a signed integer.

EXPLANATION: The comparison between pipe->num_inputs and 1 could lead to
