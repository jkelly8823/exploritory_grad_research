VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of get_user() function which can read more bytes than requested.
EXPLANATION:
The get_user() function is used to read user space data into kernel space, but it does not check the size of the data being read. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the user space data is larger than expected.
