VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a mutex lock without checking the size of the mutex.
EXPLANATION: The mutex lock is called without checking the size of the mutex, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Check the size of the mutex before locking it to ensure it is not too large
