VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines a constant DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED as a bitmask of 1UL << 9, which is a bit shift of 9 bits. This could potentially lead to a security vulnerability if the bit shift is not properly checked or validated, allowing unintended access to privileged memory regions.
