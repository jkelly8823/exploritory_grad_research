VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the index variable in the calculation of the address offset. The index variable is not checked for bounds before use, which could lead to out-of-bounds accesses and memory corruption.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet calculates an address based on the index variable, but there is no check to ensure that the
