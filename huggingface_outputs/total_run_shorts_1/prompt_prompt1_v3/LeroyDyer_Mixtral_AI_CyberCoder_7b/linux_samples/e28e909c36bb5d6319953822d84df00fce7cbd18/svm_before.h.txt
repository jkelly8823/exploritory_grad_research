VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines a set of constants that represent different exit reasons for the virtual machine. These exit reasons are used to indicate the cause of a virtual machine's exit from the virtual machine. The code does not include any checks or bounds checking on the exit reason values, which could potentially allow a malicious actor to pass invalid or malicious values to the virtual machine, leading to unintended behavior.
