VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the index variable. The calculation of index is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between the exit_info_2 field of the VM control register and 0xFF, which limits the index to a maximum value of 255. This could allow an attacker to potentially access memory outside of the intended range of the AP
