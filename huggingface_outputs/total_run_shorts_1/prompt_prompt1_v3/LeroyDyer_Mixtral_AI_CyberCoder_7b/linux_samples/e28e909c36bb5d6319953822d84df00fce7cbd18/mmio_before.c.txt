VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the mmio_write_buf function due to the use of memcpy() function without bounds checking. The memcpy() function copies a specified number of bytes from the source string to the destination buffer. If the source string is longer than the destination buffer, it can lead to buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
