VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability in the function kvm_vgic_inject_irq() which is a function that injects an interrupt into a virtual CPU. The function takes two arguments: a pointer to a kvm structure and an interrupt number. The function does not check the validity of the input interrupt number, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject invalid or
