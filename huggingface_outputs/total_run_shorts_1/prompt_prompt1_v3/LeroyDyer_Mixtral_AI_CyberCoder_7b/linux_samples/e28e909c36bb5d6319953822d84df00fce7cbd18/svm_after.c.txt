VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the index variable. The calculation of index is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between the exit_info_2 and 0xFF, which limits the value to the range of 0x00 to 0xFF. This could lead to an integer overflow if the exit_info_2 is greater than 0xFF
