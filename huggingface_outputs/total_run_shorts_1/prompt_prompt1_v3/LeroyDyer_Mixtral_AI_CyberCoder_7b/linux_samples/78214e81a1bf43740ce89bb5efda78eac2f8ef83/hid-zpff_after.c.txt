VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use dynamic memory allocation for the buffer and implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow.

The code snippet checks the size of the
