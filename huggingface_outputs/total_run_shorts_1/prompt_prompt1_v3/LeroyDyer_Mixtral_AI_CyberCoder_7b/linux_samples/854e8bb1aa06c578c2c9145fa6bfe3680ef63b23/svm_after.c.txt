VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the kvm_rip_read() function, which may not properly handle input validation.
EXPLANATION: The kvm_rip_read() function is used to read the RIP register from the virtual CPU, but it does not perform any input validation. An attacker could potentially exploit this by
