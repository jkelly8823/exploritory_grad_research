VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function xfs_ioc_space() has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable-length input parameter without bounds checking. The function takes a pointer to a file structure as an argument, which could potentially be a pointer to a malicious buffer. An attacker could pass a pointer to a buffer containing malicious data, leading to a buffer overflow.
