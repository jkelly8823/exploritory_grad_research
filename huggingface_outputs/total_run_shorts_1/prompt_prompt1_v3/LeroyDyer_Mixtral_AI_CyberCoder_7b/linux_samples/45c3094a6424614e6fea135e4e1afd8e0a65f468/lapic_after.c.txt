VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the calculation of the shift value for the logical_map array index. The calculation of the index into the logical_map array is not checked for bounds, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the value of cid is greater than ARRAY_SIZE(map->logical_map).
EXPLANATION: The calculation of the index
