VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the value of the variable 'mda'. The value of 'irq->dest_id' is shifted left by '32 - map->ldr_bits' which could result in an integer overflow if 'map->ldr_bits' is not a power of 2.
EXPLANATION: The calculation '
