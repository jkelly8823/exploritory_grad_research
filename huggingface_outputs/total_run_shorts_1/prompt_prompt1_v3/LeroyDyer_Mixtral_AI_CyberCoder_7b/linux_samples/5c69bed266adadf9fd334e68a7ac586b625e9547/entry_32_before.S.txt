VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the addl instruction, which can lead to stack overflow.
EXPLANATION: The addl instruction adds the value of the register %esp to the stack pointer, which can result in a buffer overflow if the value of %esp is not properly checked.
