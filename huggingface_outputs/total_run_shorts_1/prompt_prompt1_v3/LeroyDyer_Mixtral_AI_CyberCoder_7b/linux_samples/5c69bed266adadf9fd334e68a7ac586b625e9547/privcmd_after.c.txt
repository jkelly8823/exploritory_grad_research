VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function traverse_pages() function. The function takes a pointer to a pointer to an array of xen_pfn_t, but does not check the size of the array before iterating through it. This could allow a malicious actor to pass a larger array than intended, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
