VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of kzalloc() without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function allocates memory and initializes it to zero. However, it does not check the return value, which could lead to a memory leak if it fails. This could result in a buffer overflow and a potential security vulnerability
