VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the strlen() function without bounds checking on the name_sz variable. The function strlen() returns the length of the string without checking if the string is null terminated, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the allocated size of the name_mute and name_micmute variables.
