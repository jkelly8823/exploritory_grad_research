VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function hid_allocate_device() does not check the return value of malloc(), which could lead to memory leaks if malloc() fails.

EXPLANATION:
The function allocates memory using malloc(), but it does not check the return value. If malloc() fails, the function will continue execution without freeing the allocated memory, leading to memory leaks
