VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential race condition due to the order of operations. The order of the instructions could allow a malicious actor to manipulate the TSC value before it is written to the TSC offset.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet writes to the TSC offset before writing the MSR_LOAD_COUNT registers, which could allow a malicious actor to manip
