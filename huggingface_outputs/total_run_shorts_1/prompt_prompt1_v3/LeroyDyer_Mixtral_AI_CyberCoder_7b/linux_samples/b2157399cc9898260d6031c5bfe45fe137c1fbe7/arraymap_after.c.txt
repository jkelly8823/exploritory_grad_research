VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of array_size. The calculation of array_size may result in an integer overflow if max_entries is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of array_size is done without checking for overflow, which could lead to a buffer overflow if max_entries is large enough.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add checks to ensure
