VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the switch statement without bounds checking on the variable 'var->transp.length'.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement does not include a check on the length of 'var->transp.length' which could lead to buffer overflow if the value is larger than the maximum allowed length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking
