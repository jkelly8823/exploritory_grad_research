VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the unsafe function call to the variable 'num_bulk_in' and 'num_bulk_out' without bounds checking. The function 'usb_endpoint_is_bulk_in()' and 'usb_endpoint_is_bulk_out()' may return non-zero values, which can lead to buffer overflow
