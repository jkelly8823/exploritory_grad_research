VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows. The size variable is compared to INT_MAX, which is a constant representing the maximum value for an integer. If the value of size is larger than INT_MAX, the function returns an error. However, this comparison is not sufficient to prevent integer overflows. Integer overflows can occur when the value of size is larger than INT_
