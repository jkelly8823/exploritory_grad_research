VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable 'page_size' is assigned a value based on the comparison of the value of 'info->page_size' with two hardcoded constants. If 'info->page_size' is larger than the constants, it will be assigned the value of the larger constant. This can lead to integer overflows and potentially cause a
