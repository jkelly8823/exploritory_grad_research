VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the vapic_enter function due to the use of the copy_from_user() function without bounds checking. The function copies data from user space into the vcpu->arch.apic->vapic_addr without verifying the size of the input. This could allow an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer,
