VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the value of max_irr. The value of max_irr is shifted left by 24 bits, which could result in an integer overflow if max_irr is greater than 0xff.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of max_irr << 24 in the if statement could result in
