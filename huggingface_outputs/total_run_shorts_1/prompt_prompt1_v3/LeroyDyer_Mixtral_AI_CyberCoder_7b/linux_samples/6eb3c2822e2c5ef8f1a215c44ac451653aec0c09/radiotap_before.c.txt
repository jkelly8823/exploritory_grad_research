VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows due to the use of bitwise AND operation on an unsigned integer and a constant value. The bitwise AND operator can result in unexpected behavior when one operand is an unsigned integer and the other is a constant value. This can lead to integer overflows and buffer overflows.

EXPLANATION: The bitwise AND operator performs a
