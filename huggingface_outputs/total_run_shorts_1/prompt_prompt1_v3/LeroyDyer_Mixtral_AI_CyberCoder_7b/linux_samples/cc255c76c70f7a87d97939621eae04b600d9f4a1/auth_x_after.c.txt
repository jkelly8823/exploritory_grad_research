VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The buffer is not checked for size before writing to it, which could lead to overwriting adjacent memory.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow if the size of the data to be written is larger than
