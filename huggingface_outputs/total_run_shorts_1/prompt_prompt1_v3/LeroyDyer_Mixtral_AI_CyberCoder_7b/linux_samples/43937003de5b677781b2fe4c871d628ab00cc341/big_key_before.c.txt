VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `crypto_alloc_rng()` function which does not check the size of the input buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `crypto_alloc_rng()` function does not check the size of the input buffer, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input is not properly sanitized.
