VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to memory exhaustion attacks due to the use of kmalloc without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The kmalloc() function can return NULL if the allocation fails, but the code does not check the return value, which could lead to memory exhaustion if an attacker can cause a buffer overflow or exhaust the memory pool.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
