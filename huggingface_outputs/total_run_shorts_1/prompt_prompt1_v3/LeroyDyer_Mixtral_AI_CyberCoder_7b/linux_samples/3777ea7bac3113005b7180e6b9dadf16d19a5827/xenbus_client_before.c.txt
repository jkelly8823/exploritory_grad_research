VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a for loop without bounds checking. The variable i is incremented without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly validated.
EXPLANATION: The for loop in the code does not have bounds checking, which means that if the input is not properly validated, it could lead to a buffer overflow
