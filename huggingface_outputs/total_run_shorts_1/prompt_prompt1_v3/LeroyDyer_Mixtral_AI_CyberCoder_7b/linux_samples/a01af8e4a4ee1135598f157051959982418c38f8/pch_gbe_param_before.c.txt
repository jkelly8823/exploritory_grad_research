VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of default values for the tx_ring and rx_ring without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses default values for the tx_ring and rx_ring without bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The default values may not be appropriate for all use cases and could allow an attacker to
