VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the dereference operator '->' without checking the validity of the pointer 'sock' before dereferencing it.
EXPLANATION: The code dereferences the pointer 'sock' without checking if it is a valid pointer, which could lead to undefined behavior if 'sock' is a null pointer. This could result in a buffer overflow
