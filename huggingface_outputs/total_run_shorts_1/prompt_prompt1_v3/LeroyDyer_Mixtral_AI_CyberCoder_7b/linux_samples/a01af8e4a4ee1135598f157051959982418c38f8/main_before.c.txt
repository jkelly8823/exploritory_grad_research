VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the ar->vifs-- operation.
EXPLANATION: The decrement operation on ar->vifs may lead to integer overflows if the value of ar->vifs is large. This could result in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer integer type or add bounds checking to prevent overflows.
