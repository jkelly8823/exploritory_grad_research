VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `memcpy` function without bounds checking. The `memcpy` function is used to copy the MAC address into the `cmd.u.exact` structure without checking the size of the source array. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input array is larger than the size of the destination buffer.
