VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential race condition vulnerability due to the use of mutex_lock() and mutex_lock() in the same function. The mutex_lock() call can block the execution of the code, while the mutex_unlock() call is not guaranteed to be executed. This can lead to a deadlock if the function is called recursively or if the mutex is
