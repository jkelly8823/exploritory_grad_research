VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strcpy() function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy() function does not check the length of the source string, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use strncpy() instead of strcpy() to limit the number of characters copied.
