VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows. The variable val is compared to a constant value MAX_TCP_WINDOW, which is hardcoded. If the value of val is greater than MAX_TCP_WINDOW, it will cause an integer overflow. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
