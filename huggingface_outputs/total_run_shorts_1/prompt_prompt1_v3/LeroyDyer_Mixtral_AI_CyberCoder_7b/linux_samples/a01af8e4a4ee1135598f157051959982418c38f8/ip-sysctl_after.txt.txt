VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable tcp_adv_win_scale is compared to a constant value of 0, which could lead to integer overflows if the value of tcp_adv_win_scale is larger than the maximum value of a signed integer. This could result in unintended behavior
