VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the memcpy function call. The memcpy function is used to copy a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the size of the source buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the
