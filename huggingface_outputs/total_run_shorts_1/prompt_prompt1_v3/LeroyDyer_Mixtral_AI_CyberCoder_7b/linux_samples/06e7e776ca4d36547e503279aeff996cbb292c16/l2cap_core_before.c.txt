VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the memcpy function call.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy a specified number of bytes from a source string to a destination buffer. If the source string is larger than the destination buffer, it can lead to buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a
