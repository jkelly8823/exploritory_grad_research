VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of an array index without bounds checking. The function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because the array index is not checked against its size before accessing the array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the input value is within the bounds of the array, but it does not check if the input value is within the valid range
