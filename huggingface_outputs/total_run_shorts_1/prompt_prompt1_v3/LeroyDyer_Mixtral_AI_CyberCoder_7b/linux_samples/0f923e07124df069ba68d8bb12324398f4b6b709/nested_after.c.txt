VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the bitwise operations. The bitwise AND operator is used to combine two 32-bit values, which can result in a 64-bit value. This can lead to integer overflows and unexpected behavior.

EXPLANATION: The bitwise AND operator is used to combine two 32-bit values,
