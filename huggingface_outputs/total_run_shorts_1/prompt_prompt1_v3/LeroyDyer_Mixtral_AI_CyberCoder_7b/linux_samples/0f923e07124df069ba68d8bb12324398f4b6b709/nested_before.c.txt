VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the bitwise AND operation on svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl & mask. The mask is not large enough to cover all possible values of svm->nested.ctl.int_ctl, allowing for integer overflows to occur.

EXPLANATION: The bitwise AND operation between svm->nested.ctl
