VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of kzalloc() which does not check the size of the allocated memory.

EXPLANATION:
The kzalloc() function does not check the size of the allocated memory, so it can potentially allocate a buffer that is too small, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in memory corruption and a security vulnerability.
