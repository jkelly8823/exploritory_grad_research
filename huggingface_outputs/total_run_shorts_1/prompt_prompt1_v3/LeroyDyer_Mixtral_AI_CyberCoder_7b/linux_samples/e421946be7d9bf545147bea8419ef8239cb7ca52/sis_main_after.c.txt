VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows. The addition of two unsigned integers can result in an integer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The addition of two unsigned integers can result in an integer overflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The result of the addition of vtotal and var->lower_margin can exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned integer, causing a wrap
