VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memcpy() does not check the length of the data being copied, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the len parameter is larger than the size of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function does not check the size of the data being copied, so if the len parameter is larger than the size of the buffer, it could
