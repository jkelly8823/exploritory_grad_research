VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as the length variable is not checked before being used in the memcpy function call.
EXPLANATION: The length variable is not checked before being used in the memcpy function call, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The length variable should be checked to ensure it is within the bounds of the bytes->len variable before being used
