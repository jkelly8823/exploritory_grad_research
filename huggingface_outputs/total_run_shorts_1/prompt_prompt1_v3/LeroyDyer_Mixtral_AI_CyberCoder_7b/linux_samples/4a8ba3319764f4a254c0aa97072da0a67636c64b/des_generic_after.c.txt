VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The des_generic_mod_init function is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The des_algs array is not checked for size before being passed to crypto_register_algs, which could lead to a
