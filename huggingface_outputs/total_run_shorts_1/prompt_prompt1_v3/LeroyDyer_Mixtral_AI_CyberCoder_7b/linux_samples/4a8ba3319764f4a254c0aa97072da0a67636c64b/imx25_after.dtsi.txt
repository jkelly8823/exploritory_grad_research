VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a hardcoded value for the clock names and interrupts, which can be easily modified to allow for different clock configurations.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines the configuration for the PWM peripheral for different clock sources and interrupts, but the values are hardcoded. This can be a security vulnerability as an attacker can easily change the values to
