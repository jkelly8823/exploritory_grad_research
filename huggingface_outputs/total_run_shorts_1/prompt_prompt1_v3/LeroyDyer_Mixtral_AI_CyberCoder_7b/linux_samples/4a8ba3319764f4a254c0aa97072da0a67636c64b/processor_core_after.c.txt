VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function acpi_get_phys_id() due to the use of a variable-length buffer without bounds checking. The function call to acpi_evaluate_object() does not guarantee the size of the buffer, so it is possible for the buffer to be too small to hold the data. This could lead to a buffer overflow if
