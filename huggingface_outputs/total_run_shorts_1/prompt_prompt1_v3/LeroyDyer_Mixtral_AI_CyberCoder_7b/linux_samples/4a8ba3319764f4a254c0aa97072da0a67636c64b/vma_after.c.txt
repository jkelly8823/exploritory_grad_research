VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to stack overflow attacks due to the use of a randomized vdso address. The randomization of the vdso address is not sufficient to prevent stack overflow attacks as it only randomizes the start address and not the end address. The end address is not randomized, which can be exploited by an attacker to overflow into the vdso region.
