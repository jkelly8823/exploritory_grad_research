VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the if statement. The variable gpio is incremented from 0 to CRYSTALCOVE_GPIO_NUM, which is an unsigned integer. If CRYSTALCOVE_GPIO_NUM is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned integer, the comparison will result in an integer overflow, leading to un
