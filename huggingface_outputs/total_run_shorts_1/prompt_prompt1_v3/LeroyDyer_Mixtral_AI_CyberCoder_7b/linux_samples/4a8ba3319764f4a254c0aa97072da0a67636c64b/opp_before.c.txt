VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the mutex locking mechanism. The mutex lock is not being released after use, which can lead to a deadlock if the function is called recursively or if the mutex is not properly handled.
EXPLANATION: The mutex lock is acquired without a corresponding mutex_unlock() call, which can lead to a deadlock if
