VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The use of the rept instruction without bounds checking can lead to overwriting of adjacent memory locations.
EXPLANATION: The rept instruction is used to repeat a set number of times, but it does not check the length of the input data. This can lead to over
