VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the measured_us variable. The subtraction of the exit latency from measured_us may result in an integer overflow if the measured_us is greater than the exit latency. This could lead to incorrect values for the measured_us variable and potentially cause incorrect calculations.
