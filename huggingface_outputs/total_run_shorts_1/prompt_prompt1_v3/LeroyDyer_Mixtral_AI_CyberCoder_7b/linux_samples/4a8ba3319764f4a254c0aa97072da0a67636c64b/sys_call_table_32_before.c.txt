VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of the `asmlinkage` attribute is not recommended for function declarations in the Linux kernel. It is intended for function definitions. The correct attribute for function declarations is `__attribute__((visibility("hidden"))`. The use of `asmlinkage` can lead to undefined behavior and linker errors.
