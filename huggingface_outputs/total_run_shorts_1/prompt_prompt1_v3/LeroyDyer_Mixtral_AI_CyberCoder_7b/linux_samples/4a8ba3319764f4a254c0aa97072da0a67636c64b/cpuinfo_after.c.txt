VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code checks for the presence of specific features in the CPU using the fcpu_has() function, but it does not check for the presence of the feature in the correct way. The function returns 0 if the feature is not present, but the code does not handle this case. This could lead to undefined behavior or errors.
