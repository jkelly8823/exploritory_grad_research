VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the snprintf function calls. The format string "%u" is used to format an unsigned integer, but it is not wide enough to accommodate the size of the integer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the integer value is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The snprintf function is used to format and print the integer value to a
