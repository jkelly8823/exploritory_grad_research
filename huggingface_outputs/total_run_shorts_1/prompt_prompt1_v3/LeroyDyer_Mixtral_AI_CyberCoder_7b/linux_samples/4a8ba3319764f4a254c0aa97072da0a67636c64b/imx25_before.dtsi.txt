VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a hardcoded value for the clock names and interrupts, which can be easily modified to allow for different clock configurations.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines the clock configuration for different clock sources and interrupts for different FSL families. However, the values for the clock names and interrupts are hardcoded, which can be easily modified to allow for different
