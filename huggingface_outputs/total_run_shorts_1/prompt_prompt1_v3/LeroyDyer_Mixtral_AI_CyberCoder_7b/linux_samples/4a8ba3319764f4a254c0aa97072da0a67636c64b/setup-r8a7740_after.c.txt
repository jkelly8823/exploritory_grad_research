VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet uses ioremap_nocache() to map memory regions without the cache option, which can lead to performance issues and memory corruption.
EXPLANATION: The use of ioremap_nocache() without the cache option can lead to performance issues and memory corruption due to the lack of cache coherency between the mapped memory and the physical memory. This can result in slower
