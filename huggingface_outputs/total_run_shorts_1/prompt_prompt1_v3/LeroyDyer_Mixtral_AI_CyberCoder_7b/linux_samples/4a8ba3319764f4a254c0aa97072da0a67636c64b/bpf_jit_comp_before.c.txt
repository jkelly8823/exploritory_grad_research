VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `memcpy` function without bounds checking. The function `memcpy` copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the length of the source buffer. This could lead to overwriting memory beyond the destination buffer's bounds, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION: The `memcpy` function copies a
