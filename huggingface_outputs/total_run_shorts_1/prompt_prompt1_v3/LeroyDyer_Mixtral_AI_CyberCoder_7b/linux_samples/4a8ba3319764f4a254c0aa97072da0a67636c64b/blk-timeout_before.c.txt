VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential memory leak vulnerability due to the use of a raw pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block. The variable 'q' is a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block, but it is not freed when it is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion.
