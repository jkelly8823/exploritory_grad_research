VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the format string function without bounds checking. The format string function is used without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The format string function is used without bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to potentially overwrite memory beyond the buffer bounds, leading to a buffer overflow vulner
