VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function acpi_get_apicid() due to the use of a variable-sized buffer without bounds checking. The function acpi_get_apicid() calls map_mat_entry() and map_madt_entry() without checking the size of the buffer. If the input buffer is too small, it can lead
