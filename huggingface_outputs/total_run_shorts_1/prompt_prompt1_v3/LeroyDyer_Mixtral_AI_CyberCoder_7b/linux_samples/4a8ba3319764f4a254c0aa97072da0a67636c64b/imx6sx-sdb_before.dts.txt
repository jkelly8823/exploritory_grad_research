VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the "status" variable without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The "status" variable is assigned a string value without bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflows if the string is longer than the allocated memory space.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a bounds check to ensure that the string length is
