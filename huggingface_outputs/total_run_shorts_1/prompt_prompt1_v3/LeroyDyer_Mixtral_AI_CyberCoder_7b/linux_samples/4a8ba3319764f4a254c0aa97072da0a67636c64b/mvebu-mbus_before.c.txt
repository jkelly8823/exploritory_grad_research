VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function mvebu_mbus_window_is_free() checks whether a window is free by checking the control register bit WIN_CTRL_ENABLE. If this bit is not set, the window is considered free. This is a vulnerability because an attacker could potentially manipulate the control register to mark a window as free when it is actually in use, leading to memory corruption and data races
