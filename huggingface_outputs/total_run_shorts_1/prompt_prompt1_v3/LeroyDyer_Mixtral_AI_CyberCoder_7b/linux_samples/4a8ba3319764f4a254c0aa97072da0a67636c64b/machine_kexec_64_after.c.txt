VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the kdump_in_progress() function call without bounds checking on the input.
EXPLANATION: The kdump_in_progress() function call does not include any bounds checking on the input, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input is not properly sanitized.
