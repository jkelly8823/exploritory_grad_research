VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow on the name variable. The snprintf function is used without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The snprintf function is used to copy a string into the name variable without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the bounds of the name variable, potentially
