VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition where the counter can be read twice in the same iteration of the loop. The loop_limit variable is decremented before the readl() call, which means that if the readl() call takes a long time to execute, the loop_limit can become zero before the readl() call completes. This can lead to an infinite loop.
