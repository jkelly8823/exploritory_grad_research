VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the scale values. The scale values are hardcoded as constants without any checks for input validation, which could allow an attacker to potentially manipulate the scale values and cause incorrect calculations.

EXPLANATION: The hardcoded scale values are not checked for input validation, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the scale
