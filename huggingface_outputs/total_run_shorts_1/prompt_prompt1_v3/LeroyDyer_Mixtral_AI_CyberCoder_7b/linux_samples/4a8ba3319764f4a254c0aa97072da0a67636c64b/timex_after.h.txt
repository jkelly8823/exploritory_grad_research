VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the get_tod_clock function. The function call to get_tod_clock_ext() writes 16 bytes to the memory location pointed by the clk pointer, which is not checked against the size of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: The function call to get_
