VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The variable secondary_holding_pen_release is declared as volatile, but it is not a shared variable. Volatile is used to indicate that the variable may be modified by hardware interrupts or asm code. Since it is not a shared variable, this is not necessary and can lead to unexpected behavior.
