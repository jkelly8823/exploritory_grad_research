VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the pmd_val() function. The function takes a pmd_t value as an argument and shifts it left by PAGE_SHIFT, which is a constant. If PAGE_SHIFT is not a power of 2, this could result in an integer overflow, leading to unintended behavior.
