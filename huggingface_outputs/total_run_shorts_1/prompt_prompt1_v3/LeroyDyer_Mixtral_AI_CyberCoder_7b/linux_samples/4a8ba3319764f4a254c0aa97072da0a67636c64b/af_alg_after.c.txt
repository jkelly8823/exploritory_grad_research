VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer to an unchecked return value from the call to complete() function.
EXPLANATION: The call to the complete() function does not check the return value, which could result in a buffer overflow if the function returns a non-zero value.
