VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function sk_load_byte_slow. The function sk_load_byte_slow calls sk_copy_bits with a length of 1 byte, but the length of the temp buffer is 4 bytes. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is longer than 4 bytes.
