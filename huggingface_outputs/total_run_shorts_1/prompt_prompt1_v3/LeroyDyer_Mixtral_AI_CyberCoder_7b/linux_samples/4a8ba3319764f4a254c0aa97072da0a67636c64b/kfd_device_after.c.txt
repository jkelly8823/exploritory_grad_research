VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a goto statement which can lead to unintended control flow. The use of goto statements can make the code harder to understand and debug. It can also make it difficult to track the normal flow of the program.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using a goto statement, consider using a more structured control flow mechanism such as if-else or a loop. This
