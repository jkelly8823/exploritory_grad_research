VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition where the loop_limit variable can be overwritten by an attacker. The loop condition is checked after the readl() calls, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite the loop_limit variable and cause an infinite loop.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a locking mechanism such as a mutex or atomic operations to protect the loop_limit variable
