VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the variable 'bit' on line 1. The subtraction of KFD_VMID_START_OFFSET from qpd->vmid may result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value of 'bit'. This could lead to unintended behavior or a buffer overflow.
