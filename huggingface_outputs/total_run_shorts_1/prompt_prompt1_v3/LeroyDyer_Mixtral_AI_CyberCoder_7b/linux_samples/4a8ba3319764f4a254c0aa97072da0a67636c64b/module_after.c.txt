VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential memory leak vulnerability due to the use of vfree() without a corresponding call to kfree(). The vfree() function is used to free allocated memory from the virtual memory manager, while kfree() is used to free allocated memory from the kernel. The use of vfree() without kfree() can lead to memory leaks and potential memory corruption.
