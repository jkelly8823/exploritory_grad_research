VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the volatile keyword on the asm instruction. The volatile keyword is used to prevent compiler optimizations, but it does not guarantee atomicity. The asm instruction is not atomic and can still be optimized by the compiler.
EXPLANATION: The use of
