VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the if statement where the measured_us variable is updated based on the value of the exit latency. If the measured_us is less than the exit latency, it is set to 0. This could potentially lead to incorrect calculation of the idle time, as the exit latency is subtracted from the measured value. This could result in
