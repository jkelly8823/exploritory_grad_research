VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The buffer is allocated on the stack, and the function call to "ethernet_init" does not check the length of the input string. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The
