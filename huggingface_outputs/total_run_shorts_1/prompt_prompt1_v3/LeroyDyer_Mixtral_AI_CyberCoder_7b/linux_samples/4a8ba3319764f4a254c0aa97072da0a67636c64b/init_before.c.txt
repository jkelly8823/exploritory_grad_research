VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the function call to memblock_find_in_range() function. The function call to memblock_find_in_range() with the argument map_start may result in an integer overflow if map_start is larger than PMD_SIZE. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the function returns a value larger than the size
