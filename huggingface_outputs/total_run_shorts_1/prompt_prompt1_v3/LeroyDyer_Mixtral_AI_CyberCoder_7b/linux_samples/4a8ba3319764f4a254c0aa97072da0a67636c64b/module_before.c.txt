VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential memory leak vulnerability due to the use of vfree() without checking the return value. The vfree() call does not return a value, so it is not possible to determine if the memory allocation was successful or not. This could lead to undefined behavior if the allocation fails.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Use malloc_check_return() or similar to
