VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The variable 'i' is not checked against the size of the array 'mpu_irqs_cnt' before accessing the array index. If 'mpu_irqs_cnt' is larger than the number of elements in 'mpu_irqs', the access to the array will result in undefined behavior.
