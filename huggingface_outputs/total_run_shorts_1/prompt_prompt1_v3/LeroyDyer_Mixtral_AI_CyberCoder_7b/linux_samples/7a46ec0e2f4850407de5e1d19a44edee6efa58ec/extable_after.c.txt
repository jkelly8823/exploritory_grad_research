VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the line: *(int *)regs->cx = INT_MIN / 2; which divides the value of the cx register by 2. This division operation may result in an integer overflow, leading to an undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION: The division of INT_MIN by 2 may result in an integer overflow, causing
