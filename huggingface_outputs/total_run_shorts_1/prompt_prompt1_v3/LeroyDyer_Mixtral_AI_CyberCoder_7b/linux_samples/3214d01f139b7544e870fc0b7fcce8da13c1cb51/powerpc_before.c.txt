VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function call to kvm->arch.kvm_ops->arch_vm_ioctl(filp, ioctl, arg). The function call does not check the size of the input argument, which could allow an attacker to pass a large input value to overwrite the function pointer of kvm->arch_vm_ops.
