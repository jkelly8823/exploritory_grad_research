VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the memcpy function call.

This could lead to overwriting memory beyond the destination buffer boundaries, which could result in a stack or heap buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The memcpy function is used to copy a source
