VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippets contain a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the bitwise AND operation on the mask variable. The mask variable is shifted left by 1u, which is an unsigned integer, and then compared to a constant value. If the constant value is greater than the maximum value for an unsigned integer, the result of the bitwise AND operation may exceed the maximum value for an unsigned integer, leading
