VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the for loop. The variable i is incremented without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the number of parents is large.
EXPLANATION: The for loop iterates through an array without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the number of parents is large. The loop variable i is incremented without
