VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of a hardcoded constant value for the maximum number of bits in the DMA address space. This could allow an attacker to potentially exploit the driver by overflowing the address space and gaining unauthorized access to memory.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines a constant value for the maximum number of bits in the DMA
