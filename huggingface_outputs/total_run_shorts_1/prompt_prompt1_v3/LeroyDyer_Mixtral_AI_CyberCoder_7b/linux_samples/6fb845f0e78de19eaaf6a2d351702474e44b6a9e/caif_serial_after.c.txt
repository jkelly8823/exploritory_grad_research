VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the 'skb->len' variable without bounds checking. The 'skb->len' variable is used without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the value is larger than the actual length of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if 'skb->len' is equal to zero,
