VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the bitwise AND operator on unsigned integers. The bitwise AND operator performs a bitwise AND operation on two integers, which can result in a truncation of the result to the size of the smaller operand. In this case, the result of the AND operation between the variable val and the constant MV88E6XX
