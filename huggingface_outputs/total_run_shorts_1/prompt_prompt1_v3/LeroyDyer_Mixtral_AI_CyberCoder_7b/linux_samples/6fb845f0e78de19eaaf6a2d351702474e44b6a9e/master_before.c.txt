VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the strcpy() function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy() function is used to copy a string from a source string to a destination buffer without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use safer alternatives like strncpy() or strncpy() to prevent overwriting memory beyond
