VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the use of the MACB_TX_WAKEUP_THRESH macro definition. The macro is defined with a hardcoded value of 3 * (bp)->tx_ring_size / 4, which may not be appropriate for all cases. This could lead to incorrect calculation of the threshold for waking up the TX process.
