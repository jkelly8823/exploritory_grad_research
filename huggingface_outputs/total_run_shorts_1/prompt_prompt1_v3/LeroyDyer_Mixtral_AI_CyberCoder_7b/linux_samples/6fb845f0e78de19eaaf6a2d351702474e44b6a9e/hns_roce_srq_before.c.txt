VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of ib_copy_to_udata() function which does not check the size of the input buffer.
EXPLANATION: The function ib_copy_to_udata() does not check the size of the input buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the udata structure.
