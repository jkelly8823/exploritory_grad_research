VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential vulnerability in the bcm2835_dma_abort function. The function calls cpu_relax() which can lead to a potential race condition. The function may not return if the DMA engine is still active, which can cause a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The use of cpu_relax() can lead to a potential race condition where the DMA
