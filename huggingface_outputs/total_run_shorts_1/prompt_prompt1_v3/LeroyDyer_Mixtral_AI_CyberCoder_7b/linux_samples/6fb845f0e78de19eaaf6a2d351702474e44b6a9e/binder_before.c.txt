VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of kstrdup() without checking the length of the input string.
EXPLANATION:
The kstrdup() function dynamically allocates memory for the string and copies the input string into the allocated memory. If the input string is longer than the available memory, it can lead to buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption and
