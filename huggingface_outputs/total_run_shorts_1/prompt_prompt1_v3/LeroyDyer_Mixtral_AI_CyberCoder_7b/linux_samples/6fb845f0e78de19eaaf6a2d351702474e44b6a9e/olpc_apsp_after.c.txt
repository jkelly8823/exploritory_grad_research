VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call readl() is used without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function readl() reads 32 bits from the memory location at a time, but it is possible that the memory location contains less than 32 bits of data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the memory location contains less
