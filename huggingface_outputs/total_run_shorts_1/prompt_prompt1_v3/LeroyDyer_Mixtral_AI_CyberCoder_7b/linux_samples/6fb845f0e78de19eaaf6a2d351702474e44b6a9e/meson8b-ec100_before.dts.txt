VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the scanf() function without bounds checking. The scanf() function is not recommended for user input validation.
EXPLANATION: The use of scanf() function without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it can read more input than the allocated buffer size, resulting in memory corruption and potential security exploits.
