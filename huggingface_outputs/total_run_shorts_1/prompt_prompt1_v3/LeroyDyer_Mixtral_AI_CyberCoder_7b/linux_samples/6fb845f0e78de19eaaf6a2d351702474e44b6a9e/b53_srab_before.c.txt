VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to writel() can write more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The writel() function writes 4 bytes to a register, but the register only has 32 bits. This can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a smaller data type
