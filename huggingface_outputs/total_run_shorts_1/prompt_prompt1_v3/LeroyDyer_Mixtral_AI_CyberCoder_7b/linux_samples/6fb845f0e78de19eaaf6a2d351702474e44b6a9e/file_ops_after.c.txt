VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the vmf variable being incremented without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet increments the vmf variable without bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow. Use a safer method for incrementing the vmf variable
