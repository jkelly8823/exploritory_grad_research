VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the dentry_stat structure definition. The structure contains three integer variables: nr_dentry, nr_unused, and age_limit. The age_limit variable is not initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior when accessing it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Initialize age_limit to a safe value to avoid undefined behavior.
