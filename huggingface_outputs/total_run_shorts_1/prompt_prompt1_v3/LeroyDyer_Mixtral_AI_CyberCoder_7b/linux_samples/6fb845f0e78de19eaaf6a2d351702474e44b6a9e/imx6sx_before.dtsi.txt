VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The variable "reg" is declared as an array of 32 bits, but the value assigned to it is 32 bits + 16 bits. This can lead to buffer overflow.
