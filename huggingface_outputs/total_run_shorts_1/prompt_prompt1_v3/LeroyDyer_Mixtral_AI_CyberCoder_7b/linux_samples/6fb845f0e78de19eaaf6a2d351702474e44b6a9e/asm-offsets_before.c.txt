VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks due to the use of the offsets of the task_struct structure. The offsets are hardcoded and not calculated dynamically, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The hardcoded offsets in the code can be exploited by attackers to overwrite memory locations beyond the intended fields of
