VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the for loop. The variable i is incremented without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The for loop does not have bounds checking, which can lead to integer overflows and buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the for loop to prevent integer over
