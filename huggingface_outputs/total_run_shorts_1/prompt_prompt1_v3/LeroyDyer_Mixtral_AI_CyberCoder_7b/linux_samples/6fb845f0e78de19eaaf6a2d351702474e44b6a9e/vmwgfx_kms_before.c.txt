VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the buffer before copying data into it, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a fixed-size buffer or implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow.
