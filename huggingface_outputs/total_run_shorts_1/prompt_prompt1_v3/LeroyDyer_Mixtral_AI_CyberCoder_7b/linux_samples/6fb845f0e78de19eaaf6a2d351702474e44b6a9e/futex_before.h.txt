VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the "memcpy" function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy a block of memory from src to dest without checking the size of the source and destination buffers, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source or destination buffer is larger than the size of the data to be copied.
