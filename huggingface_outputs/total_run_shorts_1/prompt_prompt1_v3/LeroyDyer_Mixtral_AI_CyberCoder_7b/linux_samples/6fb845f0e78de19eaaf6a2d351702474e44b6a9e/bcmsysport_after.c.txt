VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of memcpy() function without bounds checking. The memcpy() function copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the size of the source and destination buffers. This can lead to buffer overflows if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without
