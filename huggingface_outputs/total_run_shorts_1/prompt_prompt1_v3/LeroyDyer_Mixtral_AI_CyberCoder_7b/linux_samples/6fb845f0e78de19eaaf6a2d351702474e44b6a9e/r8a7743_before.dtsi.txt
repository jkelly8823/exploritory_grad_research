VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable without bounds checking on the assignment of the value to the address-cells variable.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet assigns a value to the address-cells variable without bounds checking, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value exceeds the size of the buffer. This could result
