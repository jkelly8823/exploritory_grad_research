VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the source to the destination without checking the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to overwriting memory beyond the end of the destination buffer, which can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to
