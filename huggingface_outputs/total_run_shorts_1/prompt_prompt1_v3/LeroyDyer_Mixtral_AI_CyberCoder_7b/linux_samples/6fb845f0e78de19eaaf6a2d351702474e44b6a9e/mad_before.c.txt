VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation on an array index without bounds checking. The use of sqp->tx_ring[wire_tx_ix].ah may lead to an out-of-bounds access if wire_tx_ix is greater than the size of the array.
EXPLANATION: The code uses pointer arithmetic to
