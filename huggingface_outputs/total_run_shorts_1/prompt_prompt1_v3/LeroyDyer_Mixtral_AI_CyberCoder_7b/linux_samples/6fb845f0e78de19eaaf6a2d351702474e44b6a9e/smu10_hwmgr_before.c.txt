VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the pclk_vol_table assignment statement. The pclk_vol_table variable is assigned a value from the pinfo->vdd_dep_on_dppclk variable, which could potentially exceed the maximum value that can be stored in the variable. This could lead to unintended behavior or crashes.
