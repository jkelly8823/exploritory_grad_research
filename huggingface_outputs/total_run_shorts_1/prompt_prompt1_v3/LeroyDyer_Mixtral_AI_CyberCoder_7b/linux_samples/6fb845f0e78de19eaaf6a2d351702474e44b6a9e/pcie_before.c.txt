VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the base address. The calculation of base + (where & 0xffc) may result in an integer overflow if where is greater than 0xffc, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of base + (where & 0xffc) may result in an integer overflow if where is
