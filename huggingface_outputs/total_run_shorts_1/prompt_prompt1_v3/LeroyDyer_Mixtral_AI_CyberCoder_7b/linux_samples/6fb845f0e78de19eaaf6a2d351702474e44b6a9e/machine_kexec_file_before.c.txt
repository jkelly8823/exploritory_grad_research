VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the valloc() function, which does not check the return value.
EXPLANATION: The valloc() function does not check the return value, which means that if the allocation fails, the program will continue execution and may cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use malloc() instead of valloc()
