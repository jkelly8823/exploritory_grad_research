VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the "do" statement without bounds checking. The "do" statement can lead to an infinite loop if the input is not properly checked, which can cause a stack overflow and crash the system.
EXPLANATION: The "do" statement can be used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.
