VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the use of the "bnez" instruction. The "bnez" instruction is used to branch to the "resume_kernel" label if the zero flag is not set. However, this can lead to a potential race condition where the zero flag may be modified by an interrupt handler before the branch is executed, causing unintended behavior.
