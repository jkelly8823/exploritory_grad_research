VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the format string function printf() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The format string function printf() is used to format and print output, but it does not perform bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input data exceeds the size of the buffer.
