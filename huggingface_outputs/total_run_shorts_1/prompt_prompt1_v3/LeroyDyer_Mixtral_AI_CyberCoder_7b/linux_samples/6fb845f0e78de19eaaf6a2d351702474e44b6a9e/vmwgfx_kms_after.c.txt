VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the pointer before dereferencing it, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the pointer is within the valid range before dereferencing it.
