VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy a block of memory from a source to a destination, but it does not perform bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow if the source or destination pointers are invalid or the number of bytes to copy exceeds the size of the destination buffer
