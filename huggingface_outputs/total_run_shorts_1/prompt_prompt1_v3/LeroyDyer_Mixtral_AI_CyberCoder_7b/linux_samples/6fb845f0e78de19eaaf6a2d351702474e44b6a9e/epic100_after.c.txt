VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to pci_unmap_single() does not check the length of the input parameter, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function call to pci_unmap_single() does not check the length of the input parameter, which could potentially allow an attacker to pass a larger buffer than the
