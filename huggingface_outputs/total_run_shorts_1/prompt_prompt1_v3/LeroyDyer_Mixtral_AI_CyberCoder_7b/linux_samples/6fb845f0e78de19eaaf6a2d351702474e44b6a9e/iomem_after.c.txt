VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the memcpy_fromio and memcpy_toio functions due to the use of the movs instruction without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The movs instruction does not perform bounds checking, allowing for potential buffer overflow if the source pointer points to untrusted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow. Use a
