VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the base address. The calculation of base + where + (devfn << 12) may result in an integer overflow if devfn is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of base + where + (devfn << 12) may result in an integer overflow if devfn is large enough. This
