VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows. The division by zero vulnerability is present in the if statement.
EXPLANATION: The division by zero vulnerability occurs when the divisor is zero, which can cause undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a conditional check to prevent division by zero.

The code snippet checks if the divisor is zero before performing
