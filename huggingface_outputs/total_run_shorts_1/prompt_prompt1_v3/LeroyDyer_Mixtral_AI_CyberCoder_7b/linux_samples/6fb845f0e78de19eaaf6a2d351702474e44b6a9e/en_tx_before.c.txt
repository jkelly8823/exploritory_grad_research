VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of num_wqebbs. The variable num_wqebbs is calculated by dividing ds_cnt by MLX5_SEND_WQEBB_NUM_DS without checking for overflow. This could lead to a buffer overflow if ds_cnt is too large.
EXPLANATION: The division of ds
