VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows due to integer division by a constant value.
EXPLANATION: The division of a variable by a constant value can result in integer overflows, which can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a fixed-point math library or a division with a variable divisor instead of a constant divisor.
