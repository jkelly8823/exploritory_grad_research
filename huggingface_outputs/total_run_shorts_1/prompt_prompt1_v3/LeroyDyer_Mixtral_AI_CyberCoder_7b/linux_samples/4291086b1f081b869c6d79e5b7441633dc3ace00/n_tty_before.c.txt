VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the write function without bounds checking. The write function can write more bytes than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the number of bytes to write is greater than the size of the buffer, but it does not check if the number of bytes
