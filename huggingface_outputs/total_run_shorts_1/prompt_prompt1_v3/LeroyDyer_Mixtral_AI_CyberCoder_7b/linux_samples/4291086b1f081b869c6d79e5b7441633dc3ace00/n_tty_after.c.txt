VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() without checking the return value.

EXPLANATION:
The mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() functions can return non-zero values if an error occurs. If the return value is not checked, the program may continue execution and cause undefined behavior.
