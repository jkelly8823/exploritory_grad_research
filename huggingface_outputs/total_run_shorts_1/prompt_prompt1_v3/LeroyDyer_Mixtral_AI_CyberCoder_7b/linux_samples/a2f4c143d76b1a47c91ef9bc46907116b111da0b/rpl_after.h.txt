VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress() has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the function ipv6_rpl_srh_size() which does not check the size of the input data before copying it into the output buffer. This could lead to overwriting memory beyond the allocated buffer, causing a stack overflow.
