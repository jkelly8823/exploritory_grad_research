VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function kvm_lapic_sync_from_vapic() due to the use of the kmap_atomic() function without bounds checking. The function kmap_atomic() allocates a temporary buffer on the stack to map the VAPIC page, but it does not check the size of the buffer before mapping the page.
