VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the le32_to_cpu() function, which converts a 32-bit integer from the client to the server's endianness. This function does not perform bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflows if the input is not properly validated.

EXPLANATION: The le3
