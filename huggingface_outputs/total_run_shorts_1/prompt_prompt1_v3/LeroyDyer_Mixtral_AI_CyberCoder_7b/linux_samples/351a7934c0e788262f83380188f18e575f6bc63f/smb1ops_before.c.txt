VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the CIFS_ACL preprocessor directive. This directive can be used to conditionally compile code based on a compiler flag, but it can also be used to hide code from being included in the final binary. If the flag is not set, the code within the directive will not be compiled, which can lead
