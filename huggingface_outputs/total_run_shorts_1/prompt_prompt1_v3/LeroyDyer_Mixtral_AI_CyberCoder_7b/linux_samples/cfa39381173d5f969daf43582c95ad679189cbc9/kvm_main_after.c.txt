VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `kvm_get_kvm()` function call without bounds checking.

EXPLANATION:
The `kvm_get_kvm()` function call does not include any bounds checking, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
