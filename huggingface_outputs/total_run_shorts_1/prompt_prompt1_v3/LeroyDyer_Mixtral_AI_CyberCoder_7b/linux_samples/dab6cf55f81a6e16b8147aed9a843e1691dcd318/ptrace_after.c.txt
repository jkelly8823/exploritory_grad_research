VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the bitwise operations. The bitwise AND and bitwise XOR operators can result in unexpected behavior if the input data is not properly checked for size.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains bitwise AND and XOR operations on unsigned integers, which can result in integer overflows if the input data is not checked for
