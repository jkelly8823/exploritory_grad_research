VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer to a structure without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a pointer to a structure without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The use of a pointer to a structure without bounds checking can allow an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the structure's bounds, potentially leading to
