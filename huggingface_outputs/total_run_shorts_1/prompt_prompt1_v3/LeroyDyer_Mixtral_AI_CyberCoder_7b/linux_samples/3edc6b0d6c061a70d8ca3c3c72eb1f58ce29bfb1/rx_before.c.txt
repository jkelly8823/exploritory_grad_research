VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The function memcpy() is used to copy the last_pn array without checking the length of the source buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a specified number of bytes from a source buffer to a
