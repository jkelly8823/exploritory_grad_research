VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the pn array to the last_pn array without checking the length of the source and destination arrays.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy function copies data from the source array to
