VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the size parameter in the call to urb_alloc_buffer() function.
EXPLANATION: The call to urb_alloc_buffer() does not check the size parameter for validity, which could lead to buffer overflow if the size is too large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the
