VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the input buffer to the output buffer without checking the length of the input buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input buffer is larger than the output buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the input buffer
