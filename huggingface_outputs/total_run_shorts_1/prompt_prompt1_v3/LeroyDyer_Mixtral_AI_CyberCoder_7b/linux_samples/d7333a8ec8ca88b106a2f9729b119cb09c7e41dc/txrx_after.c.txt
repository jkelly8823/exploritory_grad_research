VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function wcn36xx_rx_skb() due to the use of a fixed-size array access without bounds checking. The function wcn36xx_unchain_msdu() uses a pointer arithmetic operation to access the array ab_rx_ch_map without bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the
