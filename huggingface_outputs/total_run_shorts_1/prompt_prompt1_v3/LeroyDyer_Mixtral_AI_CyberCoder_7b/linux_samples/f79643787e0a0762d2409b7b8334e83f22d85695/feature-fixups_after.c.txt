VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function do_entry_flush_fixups. The function call to patch_instruction() may lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly sanitized. The function call does not check the size of the input buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer size.
