VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function call to PACA_EXRFI+EX_R9(r13) and PACA_EXRFI+EX_R10(r13) can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly sanitized. The function call does not check the size of the input data, which can
