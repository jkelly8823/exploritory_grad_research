VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential vulnerability in the function 'vmx_adjust_tsc_offset_guest' where the 'preempt_disable()' function is called without a locking mechanism. This function is used to disable preemption, which can lead to a race condition where another thread can access the shared resource concurrently, causing data corruption or unpredictable behavior.
