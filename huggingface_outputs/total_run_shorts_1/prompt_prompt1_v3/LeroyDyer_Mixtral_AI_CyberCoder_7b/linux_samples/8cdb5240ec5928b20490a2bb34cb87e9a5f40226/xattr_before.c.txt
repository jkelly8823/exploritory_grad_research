VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the total_size variable when adding the size of the value_size to total_size.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if the total_size variable has enough space to hold the value_size before adding it, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the value_size is larger than the available space
