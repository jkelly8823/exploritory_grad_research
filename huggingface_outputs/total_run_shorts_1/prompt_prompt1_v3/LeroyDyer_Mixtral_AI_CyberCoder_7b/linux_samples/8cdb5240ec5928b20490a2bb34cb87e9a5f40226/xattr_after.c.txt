VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the EXT4_XATTR_SIZE macro which does not check the size of the e_value_size field.
EXPLANATION: The EXT4_XATTR_SIZE macro does not check the size of the e_value_size field, which can lead to buffer overflow if the value is larger than expected.
