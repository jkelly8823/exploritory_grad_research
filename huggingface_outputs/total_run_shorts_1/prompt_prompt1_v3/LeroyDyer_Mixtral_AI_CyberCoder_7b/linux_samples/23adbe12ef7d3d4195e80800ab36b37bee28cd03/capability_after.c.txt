VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function capable_wrt_inode_uidgid() checks if the current task has the given capability targeted at its own user namespace and that the given inode's uid and gid are mapped into the current user namespace. The function is exported, which means it can be called from other modules. This could potentially allow for privilege escalation attacks if the function is not properly checked for input validation
