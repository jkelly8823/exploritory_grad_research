VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of fixed-size arrays.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet declares fixed-size arrays without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the arrays and ensure bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow.
