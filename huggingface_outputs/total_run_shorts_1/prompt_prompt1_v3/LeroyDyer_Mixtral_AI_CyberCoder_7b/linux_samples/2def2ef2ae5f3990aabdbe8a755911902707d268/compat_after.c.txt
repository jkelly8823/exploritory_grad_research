VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `vlen` variable which is not checked for bounds before passing it to the `__sys_recvmmsg()` function.
EXPLANATION: The `vlen` variable is not checked for bounds before passing it to the `__sys_recvmmsg()` function, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
