VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function nft_set_lookup_byid() has a potential vulnerability in the if statement on line 10. The use of the == operator may not be the intended comparison operator. It is recommended to use the "===" operator instead to compare two integer values. The "==" operator performs a type conversion, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
