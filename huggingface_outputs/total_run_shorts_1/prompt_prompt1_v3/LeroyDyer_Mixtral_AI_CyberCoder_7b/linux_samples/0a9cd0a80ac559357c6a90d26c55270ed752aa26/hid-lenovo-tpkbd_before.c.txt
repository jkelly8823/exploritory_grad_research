VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the strlen function which does not check the length of the input string. The length of the input string is not checked before passing it to the malloc function, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The use of the strlen function without checking the length of the input string can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability
