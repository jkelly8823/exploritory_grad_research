VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains several functions that are vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the absence of bounds checking. The functions memcpy, memmove, memcmp, memchr, and memset do not have bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet shows the absence of bounds checking for the functions memcpy, memmove, memcmp, memchr,
