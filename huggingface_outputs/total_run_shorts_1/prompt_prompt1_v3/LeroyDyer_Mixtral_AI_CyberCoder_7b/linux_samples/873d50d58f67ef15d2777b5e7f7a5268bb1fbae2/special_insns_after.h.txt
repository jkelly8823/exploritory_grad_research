VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the volatile keyword. The volatile keyword is not sufficient to prevent the compiler from reordering the read/write operations for control registers, which can lead to data races and unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The use of the volatile keyword does not guarantee atomicity or ordering of the read/write operations for control registers, which
