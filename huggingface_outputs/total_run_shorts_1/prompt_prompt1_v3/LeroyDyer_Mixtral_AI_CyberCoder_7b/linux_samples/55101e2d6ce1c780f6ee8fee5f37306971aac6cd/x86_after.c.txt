VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflows vulnerability in the if statement. The comparison operator '&' is used to check if both the left and right operands are non-zero. However, this operator performs a bitwise AND operation, which can result in unexpected behavior if the right operand is zero. The correct operator for checking if both operands are non-zero is '&&'.
