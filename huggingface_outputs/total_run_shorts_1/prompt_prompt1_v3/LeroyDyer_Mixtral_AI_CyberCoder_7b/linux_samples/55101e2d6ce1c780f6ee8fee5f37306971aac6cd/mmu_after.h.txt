VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of the index variable. The calculation of the index variable may result in an integer overflow, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input values are not carefully checked. This could potentially lead to a security vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The calculation of the index variable involves a bitwise shift operation, which could result in an integer overflow
