VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows in the bitwise operations on the int_ctl_vmcb01_bits and int_ctl_vmcb12_bits variables. The bitwise operations may result in unexpected behavior if the input values are not properly checked for their size and range.

EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains bitwise operations on the int
