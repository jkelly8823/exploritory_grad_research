VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a race condition vulnerability in the vmalloc_fault function. The function checks if the address is within the vmalloc area, but it does not synchronize the page table with the reference page table. This can lead to a race condition where another thread/CPU can map the same area of the PMD before the synchronization is completed, resulting in unhandled page faults.
