VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of memcpy() function without bounds checking. The memcpy() function copies a specified number of bytes from a source string to a destination buffer. In this case, the destination buffer is the domain_info->country_code array, which is only 2 bytes long. The source string is country_ie, which is 3 bytes long. This means that
