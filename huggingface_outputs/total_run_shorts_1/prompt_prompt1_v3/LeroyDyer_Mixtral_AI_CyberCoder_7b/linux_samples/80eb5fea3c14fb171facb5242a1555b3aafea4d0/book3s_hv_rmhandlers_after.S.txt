VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the "blr" instruction, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The "blr" instruction is used to branch to a relative address, but it does not check the size of the stack before performing the branch. This could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite the stack pointer with a malicious value
