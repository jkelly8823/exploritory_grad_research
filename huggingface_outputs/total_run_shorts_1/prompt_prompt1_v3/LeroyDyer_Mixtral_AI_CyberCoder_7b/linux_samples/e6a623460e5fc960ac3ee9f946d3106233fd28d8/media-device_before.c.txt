VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the copy_from_user() function, which can lead to memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The copy_from_user() function is used to copy data from user space into kernel space without proper bounds checking, which can lead to buffer
