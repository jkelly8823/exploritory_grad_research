VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a shared mutex lock. The spin_lock and spin_unlock calls are not atomic, allowing for a data race between the two threads.
EXPLANATION: The spin_lock and spin_unlock calls are not atomic, allowing for a data race between threads accessing the shared mutex. This can lead to unpredictable
