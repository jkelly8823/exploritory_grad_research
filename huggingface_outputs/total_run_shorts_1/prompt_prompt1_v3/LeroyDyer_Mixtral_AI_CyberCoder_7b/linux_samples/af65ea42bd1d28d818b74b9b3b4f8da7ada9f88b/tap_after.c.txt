VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the 'skb' variable being declared without a size limit.
EXPLANATION: The 'skb' variable is not declared with a size limit, which means that it can grow beyond its allocated memory space, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Declare the 'skb' variable with a specific size limit
