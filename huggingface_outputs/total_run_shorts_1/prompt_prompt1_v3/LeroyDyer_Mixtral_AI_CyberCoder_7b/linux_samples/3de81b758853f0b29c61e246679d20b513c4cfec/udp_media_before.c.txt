VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of htonl() function on a variable without bounds checking. The htonl() function converts a value from host byte order to network byte order, but it does not check the size of the variable. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the variable.
