VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow on line 10 due to the use of the function call netif_carrier_ok(dev) which does not check the return value.
EXPLANATION: The function netif_carrier_ok(dev) does not check the return value, so if the function call fails, the program will continue executing and may not handle the error
