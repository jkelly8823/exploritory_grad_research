VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a potential vulnerability in the use of the gpio_to_irq() function, which converts a GPIO number to an IRQ number. This function is used to set up the IRQ for the I2C bus. However, it is not clear if the GPIO number is validated or checked for correctness. This could lead to undefined behavior if the GPIO number is
