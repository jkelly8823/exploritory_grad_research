VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of kstrtoul() function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The kstrtoul() function does not perform bounds checking on the input string, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like strtoul() or strtoul() to parse the input string and ensure
