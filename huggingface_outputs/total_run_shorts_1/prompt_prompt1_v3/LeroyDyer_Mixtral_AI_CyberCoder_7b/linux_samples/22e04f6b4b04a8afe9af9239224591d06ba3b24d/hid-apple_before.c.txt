VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of kzalloc() without a size argument.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function allocates memory and initializes it to zero. However, it does not check the return value, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the allocation fails. This could result in memory corruption and a potential security vulnerability.
