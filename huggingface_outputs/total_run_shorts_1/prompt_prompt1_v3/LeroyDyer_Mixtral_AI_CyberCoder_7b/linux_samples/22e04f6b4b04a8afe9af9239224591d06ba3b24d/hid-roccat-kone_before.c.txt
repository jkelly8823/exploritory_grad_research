VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of strict_strtoul() function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION:
The strict_strtoul() function is used to convert a string to an unsigned integer without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
