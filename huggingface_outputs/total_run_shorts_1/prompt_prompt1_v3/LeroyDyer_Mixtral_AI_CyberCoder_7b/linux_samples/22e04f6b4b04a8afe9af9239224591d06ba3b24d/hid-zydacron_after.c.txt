VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the devm_kzalloc() function which does not check the size of the allocated memory.
EXPLANATION:
The devm_kzalloc() function allocates memory without checking the size of the allocated memory, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input is larger than the size of the allocated memory.
