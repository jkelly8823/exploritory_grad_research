VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability where the programmer has hardcoded a value of 256 as a threshold for filtering out invalid events. This could allow an attacker to bypass the check by sending a value of 255 or lower, which could lead to unintended behavior.
