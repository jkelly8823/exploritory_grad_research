VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the wiimote_data structure. The structure wiimote_data has a buffer of 4 bytes for calib_bboard, which is not enough to store the 32-bit integer value of calibration data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than 4 bytes.
