VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows due to the use of strict_strtoul() function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The use of strict_strtoul() function without bounds checking can lead to integer overflows, which can result in buffer overflows and memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use safe integer parsing functions with bounds checking or input
