VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of kzalloc() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function does not perform bounds checking, so there is a risk of buffer overflow if the allocation fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use kmalloc() instead, which performs bounds checking. Alternatively, use a fixed-size buffer with a
