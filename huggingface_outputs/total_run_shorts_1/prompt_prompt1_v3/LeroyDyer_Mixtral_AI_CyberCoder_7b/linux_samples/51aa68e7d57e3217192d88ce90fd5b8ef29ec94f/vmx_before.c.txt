VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the vmcs_write32 function call. The vmcs_write32 function is used to write a 32-bit value to a memory address, but the value being written is a 64-bit value. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the value is larger than 32 bits.
