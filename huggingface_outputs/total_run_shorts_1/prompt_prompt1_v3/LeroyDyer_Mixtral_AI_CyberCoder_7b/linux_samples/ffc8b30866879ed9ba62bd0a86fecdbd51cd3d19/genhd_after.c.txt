VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the dev_set_name function which does not check the length of the disk_name string.
EXPLANATION: The dev_set_name function does not check the length of the disk_name string, which could lead to buffer overflows if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
