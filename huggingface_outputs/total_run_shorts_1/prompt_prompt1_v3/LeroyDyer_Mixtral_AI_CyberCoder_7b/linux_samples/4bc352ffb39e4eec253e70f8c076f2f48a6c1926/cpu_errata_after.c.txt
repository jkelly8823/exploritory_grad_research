VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential security vulnerability due to the use of the "volatile" keyword in the asm statement. The volatile keyword is used to indicate that the compiler should not optimize the variable, but it does not guarantee memory safety. The use of volatile in this context is not recommended as it does not provide any additional security guarantees.
