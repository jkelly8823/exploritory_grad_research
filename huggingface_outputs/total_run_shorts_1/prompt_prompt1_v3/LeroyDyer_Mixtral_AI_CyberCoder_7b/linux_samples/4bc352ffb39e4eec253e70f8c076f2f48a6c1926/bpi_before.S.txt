VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the sub instruction without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The sub instruction is used to subtract a value from the stack pointer register without checking if the result is within the bounds of the stack. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the result is greater than the stack size, potentially causing a stack overflow and crashing the
