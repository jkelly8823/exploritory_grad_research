VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippets contain a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The if statement checks if val is less than or greater than a constant value, but the comparison is done without checking the sign of the value. This could allow a malicious actor to pass a value that is greater than the maximum value of a signed integer type, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The if
