VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential memory leak due to the use of a mutex lock and unlock in a loop. The mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() calls are used inside a loop, which can lead to a deadlock if the lock is not properly released after processing each element in the list. This can result in memory leaks and resource exhaustion.
