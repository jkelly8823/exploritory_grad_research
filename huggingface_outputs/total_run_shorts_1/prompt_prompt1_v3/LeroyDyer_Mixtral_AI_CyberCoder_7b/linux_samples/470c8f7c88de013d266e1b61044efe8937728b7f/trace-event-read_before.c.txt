VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the getline() function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The use of getline() function without bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as it reads a line from a file into a buffer without checking the size of the buffer. This can result in the overwriting of adjacent memory, leading to potential memory corruption and
