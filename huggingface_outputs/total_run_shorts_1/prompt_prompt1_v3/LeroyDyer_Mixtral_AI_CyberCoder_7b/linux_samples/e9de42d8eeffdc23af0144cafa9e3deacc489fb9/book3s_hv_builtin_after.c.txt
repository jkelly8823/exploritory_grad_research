VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential memory leak vulnerability. The function kvm_alloc_hpt() allocates memory using kmalloc() and cma_alloc() but does not check for allocation failure. If either of these functions fail, the function returns NULL, but the code continues execution without freeing the allocated memory. This could lead to memory leaks and potential memory exhaustion.
