VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet shows a memory leak as the pointer to the wiphy structure is not being freed. The wiphy structure is not being freed after use.
EXPLANATION: The wiphy structure is allocated with brcmf_alloc_wiphy() and is not freed with brcmf_free_wiphy(). This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion.
