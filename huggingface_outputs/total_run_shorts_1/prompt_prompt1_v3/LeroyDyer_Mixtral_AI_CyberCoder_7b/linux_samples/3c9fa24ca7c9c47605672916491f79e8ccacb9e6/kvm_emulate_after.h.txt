VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the read_std function due to the use of the zero-extension of the val parameter to u_long data type. This could lead to a stack overflow if the input value is larger than the size of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The zero-extension of the val parameter to u_long data type can result in a buffer
