VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows. The variable val is assigned a value of 0xffff, which is an integer value that is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by a 16-bit integer. This can lead to integer overflows and potential buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The assignment of 0xffff to val is a potential vulner
