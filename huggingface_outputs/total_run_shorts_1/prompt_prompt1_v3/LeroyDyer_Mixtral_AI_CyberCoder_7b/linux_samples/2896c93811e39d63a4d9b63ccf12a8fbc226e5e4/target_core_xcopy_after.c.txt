VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function target_xcopy_locate_se_dev_e4_iter() due to the use of memcmp() function without bounds checking. The memcmp() function copies the input data into tmp_dev_wwn array without checking the length of the input data. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is
