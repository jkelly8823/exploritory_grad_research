VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `IS_ERR()` macro. The macro is not recommended for checking error values as it can lead to undefined behavior. Instead, use explicit checks for the error value.
EXPLANATION: The use of the `IS_ERR()` macro can lead to undefined behavior if the value of the pointer is not a valid pointer.
