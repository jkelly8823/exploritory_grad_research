VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the memcpy function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the message reply_data to the reply_data buffer without checking the size of the data. This could lead to buffer overflow if the size of the data is larger than the size of the reply_data buffer.
