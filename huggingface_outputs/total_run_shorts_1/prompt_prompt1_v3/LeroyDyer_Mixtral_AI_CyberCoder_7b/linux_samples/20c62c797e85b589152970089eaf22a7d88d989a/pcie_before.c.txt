VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow as it does not check the length of the firmware name string before copying it to the bus->fwname variable.
EXPLANATION:
The strcpy() function does not check the length of the firmware name string, which could lead to buffer overflow if the string is longer than the size of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
