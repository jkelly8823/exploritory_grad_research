VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a variable without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'status' is not checked for bounds before being passed to the function call, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a bounds check before passing the variable to the function call to prevent buffer overflow.
