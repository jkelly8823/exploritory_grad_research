VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability where the if statement checks for the presence of specific IEEE 802.11 frame types, but it does not check for the source MAC address of the frame. This could allow an attacker to potentially manipulate the frame type to bypass the intended access control.

EXPLANATION: The code checks for specific frame types (
