VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the qtnf_cmd_send_del_intf() function. The function call to qtnf_cmd_send_del_intf() does not check the size of the input parameter, which could allow an attacker to pass a large input string that overflows the buffer and corrupt the stack.
