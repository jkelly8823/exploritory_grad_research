VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of vsnprintf without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION:
The vsnprintf function does not perform bounds checking on the output length, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input format string or arguments are malicious.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use snprintf or a safer alternative to vsnprintf to prevent buffer overflow
