VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of vsnprintf without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The vsnprintf function does not perform bounds checking on the output length, which can lead to buffer overflow if the input format string or arguments are malicious.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use snprintf instead, which performs bounds checking and limits the output length to the size of
