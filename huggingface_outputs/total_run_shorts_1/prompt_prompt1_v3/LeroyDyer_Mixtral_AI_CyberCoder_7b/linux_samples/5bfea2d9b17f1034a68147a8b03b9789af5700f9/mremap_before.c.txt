VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of alloc_new_pmd() function which does not check the return value.
EXPLANATION: The alloc_new_pmd() function is used to allocate memory for a new page mapping directory entry, but it does not check the return value. If the function fails, the program will continue execution, which can lead to undefined behavior
