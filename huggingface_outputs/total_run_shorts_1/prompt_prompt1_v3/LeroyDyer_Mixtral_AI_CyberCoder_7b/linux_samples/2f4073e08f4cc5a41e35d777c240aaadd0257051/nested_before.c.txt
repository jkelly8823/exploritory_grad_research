VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability in the function prepare_vmcs02_constant_state. The function checks if vmcs02 has been initialized and sets the constant vmcs02 state according to L0's settings. However, it does not check the integrity of the input data from L0, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the vmcs0
