VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability in the use of mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() functions. The use of these functions can lead to a race condition where the mutex is not properly released, resulting in a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() functions are used without proper synchronization, which can lead to
