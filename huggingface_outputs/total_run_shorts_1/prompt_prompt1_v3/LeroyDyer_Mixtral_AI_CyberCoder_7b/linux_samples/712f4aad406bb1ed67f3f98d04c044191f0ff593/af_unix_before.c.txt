VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the for loop. The variable max_level is not initialized and is used without checking its value before being incremented. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the loop condition is not met.
EXPLANATION: The variable max_level is incremented without checking its value before the loop, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the
