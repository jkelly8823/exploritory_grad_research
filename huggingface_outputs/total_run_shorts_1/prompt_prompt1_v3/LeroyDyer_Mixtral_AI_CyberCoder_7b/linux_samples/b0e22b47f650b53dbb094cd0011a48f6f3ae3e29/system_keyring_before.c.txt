VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the size of the certificates loaded from the system_certificate_list. The code assumes that the size of each certificate is at least 4 bytes, but does not check that the size is within the bounds of the list. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the size is larger than expected.
