VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the add_key_to_revocation_list function due to the use of the key_create_or_update function which does not check the size of the input data before copying it into the key structure. This could lead to a potential buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the allocated size of the key structure.
