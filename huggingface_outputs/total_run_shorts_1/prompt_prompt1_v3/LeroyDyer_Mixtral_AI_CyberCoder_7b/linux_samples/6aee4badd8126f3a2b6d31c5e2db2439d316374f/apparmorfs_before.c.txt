VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of the dget() function, which does not check the size of the buffer passed to it. This could lead to a stack overflow if the returned dentry structure is larger than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The dget() function is used to allocate memory for a dentry structure, but it does not check the size
