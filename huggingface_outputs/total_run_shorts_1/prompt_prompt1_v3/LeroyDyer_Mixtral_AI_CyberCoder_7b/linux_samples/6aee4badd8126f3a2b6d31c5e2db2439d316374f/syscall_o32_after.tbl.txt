VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains several functions that have the potential to be vulnerable to buffer overflows due to the use of the sys_* prefix. These functions may not have proper bounds checking, which could lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION: The use of the sys_ prefix in the function names suggests that they are system calls, which can be vulnerable to buffer overfl
