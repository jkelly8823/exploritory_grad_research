VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines two macros, F_SETLEASE and F_GETLEASE, which are used to set and get the file lease flag. These macros are defined as constants with values of 0 and 1 respectively. However, these values are not defined in the code, and they are not recommended to be defined as constants. Instead, they should be defined as enumerated values.
