VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of a pointer arithmetic on a pointer to an array. The dereference of ns_path.dentry->d_name may lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The dereference of ns_path.dentry->d_name may lead to a buffer overflow as it is a pointer to an array. The dereference operator
