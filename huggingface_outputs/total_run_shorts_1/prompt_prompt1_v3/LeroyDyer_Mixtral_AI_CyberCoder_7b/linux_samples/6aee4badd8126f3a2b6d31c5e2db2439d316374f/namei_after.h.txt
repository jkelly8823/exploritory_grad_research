VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the function nd_terminate_link() due to the use of the min() function without bounds checking. The min() function is used to copy the input string into a buffer without checking the length of the input string, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size.
