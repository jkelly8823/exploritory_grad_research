VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the swahb32() function which does not check the length of the input data before writing it to memory. This can lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations and cause a stack overflow.
EXPLANATION: The swahb32() function writes 32-bit data to memory without checking the length of the
