VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of memcpy() function without bounds checking. The memcpy() function copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a source buffer to a destination buffer without checking the size of the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow
