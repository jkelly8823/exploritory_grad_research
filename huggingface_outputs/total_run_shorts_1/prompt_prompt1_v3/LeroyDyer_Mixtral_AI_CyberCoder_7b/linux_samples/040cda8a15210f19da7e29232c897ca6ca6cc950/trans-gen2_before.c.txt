VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The function iwl_pcie_gen2_force_power_gating() has a call to iwl_set_bits_prph() which sets the HPM_HIPM_GEN_CFG_CR_FORCE_ACTIVE bit, which could potentially allow an attacker to force the power state of the device to an
