VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memcpy() does not check the size of the source and destination buffers, which could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a block of memory from the source to the destination buffer. If the source or destination buffer is not large enough, it can lead to buffer overflow. The function
