VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential race condition vulnerability in the futex_wait_queue_me function. The code snippet demonstrates a race condition where the futex_wait_queue_me function is called without acquiring the lock on the futex_q structure. This could lead to data corruption or unintended behavior if multiple threads access the shared resource concurrently.
