VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a bitwise AND operation on an unsigned integer. The bitwise AND operator can result in unexpected behavior when one of the operands is larger than the other, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is not properly validated.
