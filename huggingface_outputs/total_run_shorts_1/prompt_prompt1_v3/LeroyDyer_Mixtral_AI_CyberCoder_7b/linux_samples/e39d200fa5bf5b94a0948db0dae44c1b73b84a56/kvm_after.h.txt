VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The function call to memcpy() does not check the length of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function copies a specified number of bytes from a source string into a destination buffer. If the length of the input data is not checked, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
