VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflows in the computation of min_offs. The computation of min_offs is vulnerable to integer overflows because it does not check the size of the value of offs before using it in the comparison.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check the size of the value of offs before using it in the comparison with min_offs, which could
