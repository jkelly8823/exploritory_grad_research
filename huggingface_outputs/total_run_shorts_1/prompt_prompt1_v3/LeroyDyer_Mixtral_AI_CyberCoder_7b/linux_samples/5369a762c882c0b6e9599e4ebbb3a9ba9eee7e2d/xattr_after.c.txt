VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `le16_to_cpu()` function which converts a 16-bit value to a 32-bit value without checking for endianness. This can lead to buffer overflow if the input value is larger than 16 bits.
EXPLANATION: The `le16_to_cpu
