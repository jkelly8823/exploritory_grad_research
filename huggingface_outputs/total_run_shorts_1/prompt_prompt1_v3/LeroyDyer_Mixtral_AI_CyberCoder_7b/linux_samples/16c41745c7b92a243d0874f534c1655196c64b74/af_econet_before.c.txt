VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of kzalloc() which does not check the size of the allocated memory.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc() function allocates memory and initializes it to zero. However, it does not check the size of the allocated memory, which could lead to buffer overflow if the size of the allocated memory is too large.
