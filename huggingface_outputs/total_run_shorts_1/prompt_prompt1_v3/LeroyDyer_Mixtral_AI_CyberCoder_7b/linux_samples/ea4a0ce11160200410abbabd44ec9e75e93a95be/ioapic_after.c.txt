VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflows. The variable redir_index is used without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not check the value of redir_index against the valid range of IOAPIC_NUM_PINS before performing a bitwise operation, which can lead to integer overflows and
