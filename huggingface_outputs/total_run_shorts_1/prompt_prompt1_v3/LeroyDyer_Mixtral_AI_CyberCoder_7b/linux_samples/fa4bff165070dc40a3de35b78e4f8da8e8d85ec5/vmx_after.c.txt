VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability related to the L1TF CPU bug. The code checks for the presence of the L1TF CPU bug and performs different actions depending on whether SMT is enabled or disabled. If SMT is enabled, it flushes the L1D cache to mitigate the data leak. If SMT is disabled, it clears the CPU buffers. The L1
