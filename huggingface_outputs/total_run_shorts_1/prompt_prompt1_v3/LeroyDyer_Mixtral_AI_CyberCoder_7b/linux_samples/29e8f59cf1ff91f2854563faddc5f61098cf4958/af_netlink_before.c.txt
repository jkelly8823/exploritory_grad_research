VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential security vulnerability. The function netlink_capable() checks if the user has the appropriate capabilities to perform the requested operation. However, it only checks for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, which is not sufficient to ensure that the user has the required permissions to perform the requested operation. The function should check for additional capabilities depending on the operation being performed.
