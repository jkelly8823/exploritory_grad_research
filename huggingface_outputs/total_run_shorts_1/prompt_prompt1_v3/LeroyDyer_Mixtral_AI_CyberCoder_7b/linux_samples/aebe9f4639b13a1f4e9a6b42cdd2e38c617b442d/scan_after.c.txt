VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the variable 'new_ies' being declared as 'struct cfg80211_bss_ies *new_ies' without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'new_ies' is declared as a pointer to a structure without bounds checking, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the size of
