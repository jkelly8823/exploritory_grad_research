VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it does not properly validate the authenticity token. The verify_authenticity_token method only checks if the token matches the one in the request parameters, but it does not check if the request is a GET request or if the request is idempotent. This is a security risk because CSRF attacks can bypass the token check
