VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of regular expressions in the `find_parameter_position` method. The regular expression used in the method may not be robust enough to handle all possible input values, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the `find_parameter_position` method may not be robust enough to
