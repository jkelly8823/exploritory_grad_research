VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The line `while (cnt > 0 && (buf[cnt-1] == '\n' || buf[cnt-1] == '\r'))` does not check if `cnt` is within the bounds of the `buf` array before accessing `buf[cnt-1]`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `cnt` is greater than the length of `buf`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that `cnt` is within the valid range of the `buf` array before accessing `buf[cnt-1]`. This can be done by adding a check `if (cnt > 0 && cnt <= buf.length)` before the while loop. Additionally, consider using a safer method to remove trailing newlines and carriage returns, such as using the `String.trim()` method. 

Note: The code snippet is likely part of a larger function, and the `buf` and `cnt` variables are likely declared elsewhere in the function. The analysis assumes that `buf` is an array and `cnt` is
