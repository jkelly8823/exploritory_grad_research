VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function iwl_pcie_gen2_force_power_gating() does not check if the device is in a valid state before attempting to reset it. This can lead to a situation where the device is reset while it is still in the process of being initialized, resulting in undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function iwl_pcie_gen2_force_power_gating() is called when the device is being reset, but it does not check if the device is in a valid state before attempting to reset it.

The function iwl_pcie_apm_config() is called before iwl_pcie_gen2_force_power_gating(), but it does not guarantee that the device is in a valid state.
