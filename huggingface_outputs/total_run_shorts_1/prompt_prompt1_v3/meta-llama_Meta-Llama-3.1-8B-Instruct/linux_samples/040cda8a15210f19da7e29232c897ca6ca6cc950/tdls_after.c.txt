VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for buffer overflow when copying data into sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates_len, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.ht_capb, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.ht_oper, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.coex_2040, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.extcap, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rsn_ie, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.qos_info, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.vhtoper, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.vhtcap, sta_ptr->tdls_cap.aid.
EXPLANATION: The code uses memcpy to copy data from the pos array into various structures. However, it does not check if the destination buffer has enough space to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. This can be done by checking the size of the buffer and the size of the data to be copied, and then using a loop to copy the data in chunks if necessary. Alternatively, the
