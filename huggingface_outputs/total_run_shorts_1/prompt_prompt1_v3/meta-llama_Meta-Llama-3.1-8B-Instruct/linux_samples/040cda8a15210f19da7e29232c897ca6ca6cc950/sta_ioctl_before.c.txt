VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data from the country_ie array to the domain_info->country_code array.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy 2 bytes from the country_ie array to the priv->adapter->country_code array. However, the same country_ie array is then used to copy 2 bytes to the domain_info->country_code array and 1 byte to the domain_info->country_code[1] array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the country_ie array is not null-terminated or if the country_ie array contains more than 2 bytes. The lack of bounds checking in the memcpy function makes it vulnerable to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the bounds of the country_ie array before copying data from it. This can be done by checking the length of the country_ie array and ensuring that it is not greater than the size of the destination array. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the country_ie array is not null-terminated. This can be done by checking for
