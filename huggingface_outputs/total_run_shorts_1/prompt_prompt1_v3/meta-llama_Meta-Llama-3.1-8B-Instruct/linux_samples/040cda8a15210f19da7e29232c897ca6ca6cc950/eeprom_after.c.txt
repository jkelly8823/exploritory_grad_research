VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (ETH_ALEN) to copy data from a potentially larger EEPROM data buffer.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the EEPROM data buffer to the mt76.macaddr buffer. However, the size of the EEPROM data buffer is not known and could be larger than ETH_ALEN. This could result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the EEPROM data buffer should be checked before copying data to the mt76.macaddr buffer. The memcpy function should be replaced with a safer function that checks the size of the source buffer, such as strncpy. Alternatively, the size of the mt76.macaddr buffer should be increased to match the size of the EEPROM data buffer. Additionally, the use of fixed-size buffers should be avoided in favor of dynamically allocated buffers or safer functions that handle buffer sizes.  The mt76_eeprom_override function should also be reviewed to ensure it does not introduce any other vulnerabilities.  The mt76x0_set_chip_cap, mt76x0_set_freq
