 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates_len variable is not checked for overflow before being used to access the sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of pos[1] is larger than the size of the sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates array.
EXPLANATION: The sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates_len variable is used to determine the size of the sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates array. However, this variable is not checked for overflow before being used to access the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of pos[1] is larger than the size of the sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates array. A buffer overflow can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the value of sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates_len before using it to access the sta_ptr->tdls_cap.rates array. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the value of sta_ptr->tdls_cap
