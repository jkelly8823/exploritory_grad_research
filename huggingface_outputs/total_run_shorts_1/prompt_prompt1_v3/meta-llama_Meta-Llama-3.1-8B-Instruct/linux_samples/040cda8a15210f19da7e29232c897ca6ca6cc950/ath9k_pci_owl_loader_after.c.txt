VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of usleep_range() which introduces a predictable delay.
EXPLANATION: The usleep_range() function introduces a predictable delay, which can be exploited by an attacker to infer information about the system's internal state. This is a classic example of a timing attack vulnerability. The use of usleep_range() in this code snippet is unnecessary and can be removed to prevent this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the usleep_range() function call to prevent the timing attack vulnerability. The code should be modified to use a more secure method of synchronization, such as using a lock or a more robust synchronization primitive. Additionally, consider using a constant delay instead of a range to further reduce the predictability of the delay.  ```c
			val = swahb32(val);
		}

		iowrite32(val, mem + reg);
		// Remove the usleep_range() function call
		// usleep_range(100, 120);
	}

	pci_read_config_word(pdev, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
```  ```c
