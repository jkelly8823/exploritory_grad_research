VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of usleep_range() which introduces a predictable delay.
EXPLANATION: The usleep_range() function introduces a predictable delay, which can be exploited by an attacker to infer information about the system's internal state. This is a classic example of a timing attack vulnerability. The use of usleep_range() in this code snippet is likely intended to introduce a delay between writes to the memory, but it can be used by an attacker to measure the time it takes to execute certain operations, potentially revealing sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more secure method to introduce a delay, such as using a random number generator to generate a delay. Alternatively, consider using a timing-safe function, such as clock_gettime() or gettimeofday(), which can provide a more consistent and unpredictable delay. Additionally, consider using a secure method to write to the memory, such as using a secure write function or a hardware-based secure write mechanism.  It is also recommended to review the code and ensure that there are no other potential timing attack vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to consider using a secure coding practice
