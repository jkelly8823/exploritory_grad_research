VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The skb variable is used after it has been freed in the event of a skb alloc failure.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a goto statement to jump to the cont label in the event of a skb alloc failure. However, the skb variable is still used after this point, which could result in a use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the skb variable is freed when the skb alloc failure occurs, but it is still being used in the cont label.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the skb variable should be checked for NULL before it is used. This can be done by adding a check before the cont label to ensure that skb is not NULL. If skb is NULL, then the code should handle this situation accordingly. For example, it could print an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop. Here is an example of how the code could be modified to fix this vulnerability: 

```c
rcu_read_lock();
for_each_netdev_rcu(&init_net, ifp) {
    dev_hold(ifp);
    if (!is_ao
