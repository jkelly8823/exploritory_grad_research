 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a list of function names or test cases, and does not contain any executable code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet consists of three function names or test cases: test_sockmap, test_lirc_mode2_user, and get_cgroup_id_user. These names do not contain any executable code, and therefore do not pose any risk of introducing vulnerabilities. The code snippet appears to be a list of test cases or function names, which is a common practice in software development.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as the code snippet does not contain any executable code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that function names and test cases are properly documented and follow a consistent naming convention.  ```bash
# Example of proper documentation and naming convention
# test_sockmap: Test case for sockmap functionality
# test_lirc_mode2_user: Test case for lirc_mode2_user functionality
# get_cgroup_id_user: Function to retrieve cgroup ID for user
