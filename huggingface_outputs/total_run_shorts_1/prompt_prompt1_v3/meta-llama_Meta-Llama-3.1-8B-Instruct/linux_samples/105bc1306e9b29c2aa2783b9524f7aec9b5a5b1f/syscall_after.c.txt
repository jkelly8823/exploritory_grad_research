 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a fallthrough vulnerability. The switch statement in the first block of code does not have a break statement at the end, which allows the code to fall through to the next case statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement in the first block of code is missing a break statement at the end. This allows the code to fall through to the next case statement, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. The second block of code also contains a similar issue, where the switch statement does not have a break statement at the end.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a break statement at the end of each switch statement. This will prevent the code from falling through to the next case statement and ensure that the correct code path is executed. For example, the first block of code should be modified as follows: case BPF_LIRC_MODE2: ptype = BPF_PROG_TYPE_LIRC_MODE2; break; case BPF_FLOW_DISSECTOR: ptype = BPF_PROG_TYPE_FLOW_DISSECTOR; break; default: return -
