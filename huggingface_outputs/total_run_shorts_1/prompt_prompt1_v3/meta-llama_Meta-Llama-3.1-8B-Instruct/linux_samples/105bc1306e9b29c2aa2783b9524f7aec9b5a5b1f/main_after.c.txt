VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Format string vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a format string vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in the first line of the code, where the string "%s batch file FILE\n" is used. This string is then passed to a function that likely uses it to format a string, but the string contains a format specifier ("%s") without a corresponding argument. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the formatted string, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the format specifiers in the string match the number and types of arguments passed to the function. In this case, the string should be modified to remove the extra format specifier ("%s") or to add a corresponding argument to the function call. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all format strings are properly validated and sanitized to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the function being called is properly handling the format string and arguments.  It is also recommended to use a safer method of string formatting, such as using a library like printf or a safer string formatting function
