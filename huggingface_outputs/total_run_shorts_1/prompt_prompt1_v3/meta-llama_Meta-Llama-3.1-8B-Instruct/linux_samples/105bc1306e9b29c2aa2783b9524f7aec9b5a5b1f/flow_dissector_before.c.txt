VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the num_hdrs variable.
EXPLANATION: The num_hdrs variable is used to index into an array without checking if it is within the valid range. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of num_hdrs is greater than the size of the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that num_hdrs is within the valid range before using it to index into the array. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if num_hdrs is less than or equal to the size of the array. For example: if (num_hdrs <= MAX_FLOW_DISSECT_HDRS) {... } else {... }. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a linked list or a vector to avoid buffer overflows altogether.  ```c
if (num_hdrs <= MAX_FLOW_DISSECT_HDRS) {
    // safe to access array
} else {
    // handle error or out of bounds condition
}
``` ```c
if (num_hdrs <= MAX_FLOW_DISSECT_HDRS)
