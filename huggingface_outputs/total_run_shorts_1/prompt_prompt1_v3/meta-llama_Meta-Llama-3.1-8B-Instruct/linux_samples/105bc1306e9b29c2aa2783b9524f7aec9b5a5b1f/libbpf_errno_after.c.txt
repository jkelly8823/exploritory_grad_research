VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system for handling error codes and netlink messages. It defines a set of error codes and a function for converting error codes to human-readable strings. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other common issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues and consider using tools like static analysis or code review to identify potential problems.  The code could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of each error code and the function. This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.  Additionally, the function could be improved by checking the return value of the `snprintf` function to ensure that the error message was successfully written to the buffer.  However, these are not security vulnerabilities, but rather suggestions for improving the code's maintainability and robustness.  The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
