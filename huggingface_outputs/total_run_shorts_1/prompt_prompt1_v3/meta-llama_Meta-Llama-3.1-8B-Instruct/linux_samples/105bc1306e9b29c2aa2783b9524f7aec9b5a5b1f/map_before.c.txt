VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The `key` and `value` pointers are freed in the `else` branch, but they are still used in the `if (json_output)` block.
EXPLANATION: The `key` and `value` pointers are allocated using `malloc` and `alloc_value`, respectively. However, in the `else` branch, they are freed using `free`. This means that when the `if (json_output)` block is executed, the `key` and `value` pointers are no longer valid, leading to a use-after-free bug.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the `key` and `value` pointers should be freed before the `if (json_output)` block is executed. Alternatively, the `key` and `value` pointers should be allocated on the stack instead of using `malloc` and `alloc_value`. This would prevent the use-after-free bug.
