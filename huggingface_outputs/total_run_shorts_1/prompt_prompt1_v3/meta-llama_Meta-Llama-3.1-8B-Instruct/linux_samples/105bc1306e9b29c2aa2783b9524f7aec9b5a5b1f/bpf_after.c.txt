VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the log_buf_size parameter.
EXPLANATION: The bpf_load_btf function takes a log_buf parameter with a size of log_buf_size, but it does not check if the provided size is sufficient to hold the log message. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the log_buf_size parameter to ensure it does not exceed the actual size of the log_buf. This can be done by using the strlen function to get the length of the log message and comparing it to the provided size. If the size is exceeded, return an error code. Additionally, consider using a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflows.
