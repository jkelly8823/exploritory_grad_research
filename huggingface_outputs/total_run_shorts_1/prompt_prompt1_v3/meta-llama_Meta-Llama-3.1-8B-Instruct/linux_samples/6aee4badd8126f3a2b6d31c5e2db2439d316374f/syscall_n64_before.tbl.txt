 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a system call table, where it maps system call numbers to their corresponding function names. There are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a simple mapping of system call numbers to function names. It does not contain any code that could potentially lead to a vulnerability such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. The function names appear to be valid and do not contain any suspicious characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a clean and safe implementation of a system call table. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure coding practice and follow the best practices for system call handling.  ```bash
# Example of a secure system call handling
if (syscall_number == 0) {
    // Handle system call 0
} else if (syscall_number == 1) {
    // Handle system call 1
} else {
    // Handle unknown system call
}
