VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the 'usize' parameter in the 'openat2' function.
EXPLANATION: The 'usize' parameter is used to determine the size of the 'how' structure, but it is not checked for validity. This allows an attacker to pass a large value for 'usize', causing the 'copy_struct_from_user' function to read beyond the bounds of the 'how' structure, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The 'usize' parameter should be checked for validity before calling 'copy_struct_from_user'. A simple check can be added to ensure that 'usize' is greater than or equal to the size of the 'how' structure. Additionally, the 'copy_struct_from_user' function should be modified to handle the case where 'usize' is larger than the size of the 'how' structure. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the 'usize' parameter does not exceed the size of the 'how' structure. If it does, an error should be returned.
