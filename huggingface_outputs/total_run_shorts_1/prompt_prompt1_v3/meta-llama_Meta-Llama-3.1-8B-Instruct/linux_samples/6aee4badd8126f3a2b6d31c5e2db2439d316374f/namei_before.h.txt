VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the nd_terminate_link function. The function does not check if the maxlen parameter is less than or equal to the len parameter before accessing the name array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if maxlen is greater than len.
EXPLANATION: The nd_terminate_link function is designed to terminate a string at a specified length. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the maxlen parameter. If maxlen is greater than len, the function will access memory outside the bounds of the name array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check if maxlen is less than or equal to len before accessing the name array. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check the condition. For example: if (maxlen <= len) {... } else {... } This will prevent the buffer overflow and ensure the function operates safely. Additionally, it is recommended to use a safer function, such as strncpy, to copy the string instead of manually terminating it. This will help prevent similar vulnerabilities in
