 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The function release_sock(sk) is called before checking if the socket is bound. This can lead to a situation where the socket is released before it is bound, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the release_sock function is called before the check for the socket being bound. This can lead to a situation where the socket is released before it is bound, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the release_sock function should be called after the check for the socket being bound. This will ensure that the socket is not released before it is bound, preventing the use-after-free vulnerability. The corrected code should look like this: if (daddr == 0 || rs->rs_bound_addr == 0) { ret = -ENOTCONN; /* XXX not a great errno */ goto out; } release_sock(sk); if (payload_len > rds_sk_sndbuf(rs)) { ret = -EMSGSIZE; goto out; } .
