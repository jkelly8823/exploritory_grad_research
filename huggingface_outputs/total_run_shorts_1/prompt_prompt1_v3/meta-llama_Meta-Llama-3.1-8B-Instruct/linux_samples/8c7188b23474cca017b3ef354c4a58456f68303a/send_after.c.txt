VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the payload_len variable before passing it to the rds_sk_sndbuf function.
EXPLANATION: The rds_sk_sndbuf function is used to retrieve the maximum amount of data that can be sent over the socket. However, the payload_len variable is not checked for validity before being passed to this function. If payload_len is larger than the actual buffer size, it could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing the program to crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that payload_len is within the valid range before passing it to the rds_sk_sndbuf function. This can be done by checking if payload_len is less than or equal to the actual buffer size, and returning an error if it is not. For example: if (payload_len > rds_sk_sndbuf(rs)) { ret = -EMSGSIZE; goto out; } should be replaced with: if (payload_len > rds_sk_sndbuf(rs)) { ret = -EMSGSIZE; goto out;
