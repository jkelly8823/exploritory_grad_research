VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The keyring pointer is being used after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The keyring pointer is being used after it has been freed in the first if statement. The keyring pointer is then freed again in the second if statement, but the code still attempts to use it in the goto error2 statement.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The keyring pointer should be checked for NULL before attempting to use it in the goto error2 statement. This can be done by adding a check before the goto statement. For example: if (keyring!= NULL) { goto error2; } else { /* handle the case where keyring is NULL */ }  Alternatively, the keyring pointer should be set to NULL after it is freed to prevent it from being used again. For example: keyring = NULL; goto error2;  This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability.  Additionally, the goto statement should be avoided in favor of a more explicit return statement to prevent similar issues in the future.  For example: return PTR_ERR(keyring);  or  return 0;  depending on the desired
