VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  There are no vulnerabilities in this code snippet. It appears to be a set of function declarations and extern statements, which are used to declare external variables and functions. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the use of extern statements may indicate that the variables and functions are defined elsewhere in the codebase, and that this snippet is simply a declaration. If the variables and functions are not properly defined or initialized elsewhere, it could potentially lead to issues. But in the context of this snippet alone, there are no vulnerabilities. 
```python
def get_user_data():
    user_data = {}
    user_data['username'] = get_username()
    user_data['email'] = get_email()
    return user_data

def get_username():
    return os.environ.get('USERNAME')

def get_email():
    return os.environ.get('EMAIL')
```
