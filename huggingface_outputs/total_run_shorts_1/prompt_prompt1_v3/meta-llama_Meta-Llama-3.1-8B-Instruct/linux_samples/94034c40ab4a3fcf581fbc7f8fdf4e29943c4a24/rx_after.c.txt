VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the rx_pn array to the last_pn array without checking the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data being copied is greater than the size of the last_pn array.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the rx_pn array to the last_pn array. The size of the data being copied is IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN, which is the length of the last_pn array. However, the code does not check if the length of the data being copied is greater than the size of the last_pn array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data being copied is greater than the size of the last_pn array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the bounds of the array before copying data to it. This can be done by using the strncpy function instead of memcpy, which allows for bounds checking. Alternatively, the code can use the memcpy function with the size of the array
