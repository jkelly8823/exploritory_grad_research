VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the rx_pn array to the last_pn field of the entry structure. However, the size of the rx_pn array is not checked before the copy operation, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the array is larger than the last_pn field.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the memcpy function to copy data from the rx_pn array to the last_pn field of the entry structure. The size of the rx_pn array is not checked before the copy operation, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the array is larger than the last_pn field. This is a potential security vulnerability because it could allow an attacker to write arbitrary data to the last_pn field, potentially leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the rx_pn array before the memcpy operation to ensure that it is not larger than the last_pn field. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the size of the rx_pn array is less than or
