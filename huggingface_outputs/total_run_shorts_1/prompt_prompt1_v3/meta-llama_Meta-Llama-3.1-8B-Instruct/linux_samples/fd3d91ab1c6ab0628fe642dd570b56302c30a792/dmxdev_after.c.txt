VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The mutex is locked in the dvb_dmxdev_release function, but the mutex is also locked in the main code snippet. This can cause a deadlock if the dvb_dmxdev_release function is called while the main code snippet is holding the mutex.
EXPLANATION: The mutex is locked in the dvb_dmxdev_release function to prevent any further access to the dmxdev structure. However, the main code snippet also locks the mutex to prevent any other threads from accessing the dmxdev structure. If the dvb_dmxdev_release function is called while the main code snippet is holding the mutex, a deadlock will occur because the dvb_dmxdev_release function will be waiting for the mutex to be released, but the main code snippet is holding the mutex and will not release it until it is done with it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the mutex should be unlocked in the main code snippet before calling the dvb_dmxdev_release function. This will prevent the deadlock from occurring. Alternatively, the mutex should be locked in the dvb_dmxdev_release function using
