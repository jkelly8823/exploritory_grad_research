VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a feature overlap issue. The feature bits are not properly isolated, which can lead to unexpected behavior when multiple features are enabled.
EXPLANATION: The code defines multiple feature bits using the DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE macro, but some of these bits overlap. For example, the MSG_ADDR2 feature bit overlaps with the FS_CHANGE_ATTR feature bit. This can cause issues when multiple features are enabled, as the overlapping bits can interfere with each other. Additionally, the code defines a feature bit called RESERVED, which is marked as a sentinel and should not be used. However, it is still defined and can potentially be used accidentally.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the overlapping feature bits should be isolated and made non-overlapping. This can be done by redefining the feature bits using a different set of values. Additionally, the RESERVED feature bit should be removed or marked as deprecated to prevent it from being used accidentally. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all feature bits are properly isolated and do not overlap.  VULNERABLE: YES
