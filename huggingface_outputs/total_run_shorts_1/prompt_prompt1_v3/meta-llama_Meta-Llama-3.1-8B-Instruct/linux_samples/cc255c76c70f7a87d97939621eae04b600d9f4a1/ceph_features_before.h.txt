 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains overlapping feature flags. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the flags are used in conjunction with each other.
EXPLANATION: The code defines multiple feature flags with the same bit number, which can cause conflicts when the flags are used together. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the overlapping feature flags should be redefined with unique bit numbers. This can be done by incrementing the bit number for each feature flag. For example, the first feature flag can be defined with bit number 59, the second feature flag can be defined with bit number 60, and so on. This will ensure that each feature flag has a unique bit number and can be used without conflicts. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all feature flags are properly defined and used.  The line numbers 1, 3, and 5 contain the overlapping feature flags. The first feature flag is FS_BTIME, the second feature flag is FS_CHANGE_ATTR, and the third feature flag is MSG_ADDR2. These flags should be redefined with unique
