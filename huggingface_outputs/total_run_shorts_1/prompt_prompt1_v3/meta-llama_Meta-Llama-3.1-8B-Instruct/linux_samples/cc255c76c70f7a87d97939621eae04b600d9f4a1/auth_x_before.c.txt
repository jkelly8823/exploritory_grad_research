VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The variable `enc_buf` is not checked for its size before being used to store the `sigblock` structure. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of `sigblock` exceeds the size of `enc_buf`.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a pointer `enc_buf` to store the `sigblock` structure. However, the size of `enc_buf` is not checked before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of `sigblock` exceeds the size of `enc_buf`. The `sigblock` structure is 32 bytes in size, but the size of `enc_buf` is not known. If the size of `enc_buf` is less than 32 bytes, a buffer overflow will occur when trying to store the `sigblock` structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of `enc_buf` should be checked before being used to store the `sigblock` structure. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the size of `enc_buf` is greater than or equal to the
