VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential stack-based buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `lea` instruction to adjust the stack pointer.
EXPLANATION: The `lea` instruction is used to load the address of a local variable onto the stack pointer, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the variable is not properly bounded. In this case, the variable is not explicitly bounded, and the `lea` instruction is used to adjust the stack pointer by a fixed offset, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a safer method of adjusting the stack pointer, such as using the `sub` instruction to subtract a fixed offset from the stack pointer. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all variables are properly bounded and that the stack pointer is not adjusted in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow. The `SAVE_ALL` instruction should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow.  The `ret_from_exception` label should be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to a buffer overflow.  The `
