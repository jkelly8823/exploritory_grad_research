VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential data corruption vulnerability exists due to the use of the |= operator to modify the value of val. This operation can lead to unexpected behavior if the value of CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN is not properly cleared before being ORed with val.
EXPLANATION: The |= operator performs a bitwise OR operation on the value of val and CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN. However, if CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN has any bits set that are not present in val, these bits will be set in val, potentially causing unexpected behavior. This is particularly problematic in this context because the value of val is being written to a register (cnthctl_el2) that is used to control the timer. If the value of val is not properly cleared before being written to this register, it could lead to data corruption or other unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the value of val should be cleared before being ORed with CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN. This can be done using the &= operator to clear the bits in val that are not present in CNTHCTL_EL1PCTEN. For
