VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between kvm_arm_halt_guest and kvm_arm_resume_guest. The kvm_arm_halt_guest function sets the pause flag for all vcpus, but the kvm_arm_resume_guest function does not check if the pause flag is already set before resuming the vcpus. This can lead to a situation where a vcpu is resumed before it has been halted, resulting in a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that kvm_arm_halt_guest and kvm_arm_resume_guest are not properly synchronized. The kvm_arm_halt_guest function sets the pause flag for all vcpus, but the kvm_arm_resume_guest function does not check if the pause flag is already set before resuming the vcpus. This can lead to a situation where a vcpu is resumed before it has been halted, resulting in a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the kvm_arm_resume_guest function should check if the pause flag is already set before resuming the vcpus. This can be done by adding a check for the pause flag in the kvm_arm_resume_guest function, similar to the check in the
