VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A format string vulnerability is present in the code. The vulnerability is due to the use of user-controlled input in the format string without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the TP_printk function to print formatted strings. However, the format string is constructed from user-controlled input (e.g. __entry->e, __entry->data) without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary format specifiers and arguments, potentially leading to a format string vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function like snprintf or sprintf to format the strings, and ensure that the format string is properly sanitized and validated. Additionally, consider using a library like fmt or a safer alternative to TP_printk. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all user-controlled input is properly validated and sanitized throughout the codebase. 

Note: The TP_printk function is a custom function and its behavior may vary depending on the specific implementation. However, in general, it is not recommended to use user-controlled input in format strings without proper sanitization. 

Also, the code uses
