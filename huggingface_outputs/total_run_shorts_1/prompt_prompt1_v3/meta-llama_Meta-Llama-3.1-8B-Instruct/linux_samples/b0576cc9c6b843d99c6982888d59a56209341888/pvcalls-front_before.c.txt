VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in this code. The `free_pages` and `free_page` functions are called before the `alloc_active_ring` function is called, which may lead to accessing freed memory.
EXPLANATION: The `free_pages` and `free_page` functions are called before the `alloc_active_ring` function is called, which may lead to accessing freed memory. This is a use-after-free vulnerability because the memory is freed before it is used again in the `alloc_active_ring` function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `free_pages` and `free_page` functions should be called after the `alloc_active_ring` function is called. The correct order should be: 1. `alloc_active_ring` function, 2. `free_pages` and `free_page` functions. This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability. Additionally, it is recommended to check the return value of the `alloc_active_ring` function to ensure it is successful before freeing the memory. ```c
if (alloc_active_ring(map)) {
    free_pages((unsigned long)map->active.data.in,
            map->active
