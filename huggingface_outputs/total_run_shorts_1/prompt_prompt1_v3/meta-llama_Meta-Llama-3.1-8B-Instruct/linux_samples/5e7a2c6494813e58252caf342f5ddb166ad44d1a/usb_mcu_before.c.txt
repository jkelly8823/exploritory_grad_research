 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where mt76_poll_msec() returns false. This can lead to a situation where the device is not properly powered on, resulting in a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the device is powered off by testing the MT76_STATE_POWER_OFF bit. If it is powered off, it restarts the MCU and waits for the device to be powered on. However, if mt76_poll_msec() returns false, the code does not handle this case properly. It does not check if the device is still powered off, and it does not take any action to recover from this situation. This can lead to a denial of service, where the device is not properly powered on and cannot be used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of mt76_poll_msec() and take action if it returns false. This could involve restarting the MCU again or taking some other action to recover from the situation. The code should also check if the device is still powered off after mt76_poll_msec() returns false, and take action if it is. This could involve logging an error message
