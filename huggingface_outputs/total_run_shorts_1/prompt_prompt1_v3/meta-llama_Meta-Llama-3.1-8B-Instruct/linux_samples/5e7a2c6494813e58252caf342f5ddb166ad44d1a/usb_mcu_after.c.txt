VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential null pointer dereference due to lack of error checking on mt76_set function call.
EXPLANATION: The mt76_set function is called without any error checking. If the function fails, it may return an error code, but this error code is not checked. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if the function fails and the dev pointer is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add error checking to the mt76_set function call to ensure that it does not return an error code. This can be done by checking the return value of the function and handling any errors that may occur. For example: if (mt76_set(dev, MT_UDMA_TX_QSEL, MT_FW_DL_EN)!= 0) { handle_error(); } where handle_error is a function that handles any errors that may occur.  Also, consider adding a null check for the dev pointer before calling mt76_set to prevent a null pointer dereference. For example: if (dev!= NULL) { mt76_set(dev, MT_UDMA_TX_QSEL, MT_FW_DL_EN); } else { handle_error(); } where handle_error is a function that handles any
