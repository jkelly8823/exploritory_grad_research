VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The `sta->supp_rates[band]` array is not checked for bounds before being used to populate the `ra_info->legacy` field. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `sta->supp_rates[band]` array is not checked for bounds before being used to populate the `ra_info->legacy` field. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. The `cpu_to_le16` function is used to convert the value to a 16-bit little-endian value, but it does not perform any bounds checking. If the value in the `sta->supp_rates[band]` array is larger than 16 bits, it could overflow the buffer and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the bounds of the `sta->supp_rates[band]` array before using it to populate the `ra_info->legacy` field. This can be done by checking if the index `band` is within
