VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the code. The variable'mcu_ops' is not initialized before it is used.
EXPLANATION: The variable'mcu_ops' is declared but not initialized before it is used in the line 'dev->mt76.mcu_ops = &mt7663s_mcu_ops'. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if'mt7663s_mcu_ops' is not properly initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable'mcu_ops' should be initialized before it is used. This can be done by assigning a valid value to'mcu_ops' before the line 'dev->mt76.mcu_ops = &mt7663s_mcu_ops'. For example:'struct mt7615_mcu_ops *mcu_ops = &mt7663s_mcu_ops;'. This will ensure that'mcu_ops' is not null when it is used.  VULNERABLE: YES
