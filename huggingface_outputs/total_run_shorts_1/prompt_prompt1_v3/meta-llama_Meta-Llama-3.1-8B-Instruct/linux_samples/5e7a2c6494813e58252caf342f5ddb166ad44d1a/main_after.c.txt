VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not check the size of the phy_cap_info array before assigning values to it.
EXPLANATION: The phy_cap_info array is being assigned values without checking its size, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the array is not large enough to hold the assigned values. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the size of the phy_cap_info array before assigning values to it. This can be done by checking the size of the array and ensuring that the assigned values do not exceed that size. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to prevent buffer overflows.  The line he_cap_elem->phy_cap_info[2] = should be removed or the value assigned to it should be checked to ensure it does not exceed the size of the array.  The code should also consider using a safer method to assign values to the phy_cap_info array, such as using a loop to iterate over the array and assign values to each element individually.  The code should also consider using a safer method
