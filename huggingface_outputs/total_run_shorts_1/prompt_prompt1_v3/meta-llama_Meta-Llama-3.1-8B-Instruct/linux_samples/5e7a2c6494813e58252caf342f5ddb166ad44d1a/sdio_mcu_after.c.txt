VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the code. The variable'mcu_ops' is not initialized before being dereferenced.
EXPLANATION: The variable'mcu_ops' is declared but not initialized before being used. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if'mt7663s_mcu_ops' is not properly initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable'mcu_ops' should be initialized before being used. This can be done by assigning a valid value to'mcu_ops' before the line where it is dereferenced. For example: dev->mt76.mcu_ops = &mt7663s_mcu_ops; should be changed to dev->mt76.mcu_ops = mt7663s_mcu_ops; and then mt7663s_mcu_ops should be properly initialized. Alternatively, a check should be added to ensure that'mcu_ops' is not null before it is used. For example: if (mcu_ops!= NULL) {... } else {... }.
