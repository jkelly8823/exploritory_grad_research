VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The variable 'vmcs12' is not checked for null before being dereferenced.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks the value of 'vmcs12->guest_cr0' and 'vmcs12->exception_bitmap' without first checking if 'vmcs12' is null. If 'vmcs12' is null, this will result in a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Before dereferencing 'vmcs12', check if it is null and handle the case where it is null. This can be done by adding a null check before the dereferences, for example: if (vmcs12!= NULL) {... } else {... }.
```python
def is_page_fault(intr_info):
    return (intr_info & INTR_INFO_PAGE_FAULT)!= 0

def is_no_device(intr_info):
    return (intr_info & INTR_INFO_NO_DEVICE)!= 0
```
