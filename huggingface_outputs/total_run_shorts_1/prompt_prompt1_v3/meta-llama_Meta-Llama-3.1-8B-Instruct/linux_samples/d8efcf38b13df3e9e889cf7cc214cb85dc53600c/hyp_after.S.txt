 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential stack-based buffer overflow attack due to the use of the "pop" instruction to retrieve values from the stack without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The "pop" instruction is used to retrieve values from the stack, but it does not perform any bounds checking. This means that if the stack is corrupted or manipulated in some way, the code may attempt to access memory outside of the intended stack frame, leading to a potential buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer instruction, such as "ldr" or "ldp", to load values from the stack, and ensure that the stack is properly aligned and bounded to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the code should implement proper bounds checking to ensure that the values retrieved from the stack are within the expected range.
