 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in this code. The variable'report' is used after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The variable'report' is freed when the function returns due to an error. However, the code continues to use'report' after this point. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable'report' should be freed before the function returns. This can be done by adding a call to kfree(report) before the return statement. Alternatively, the code can be restructured to avoid using'report' after it has been freed.  The line that is vulnerable is line 14.
