VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The variable 'field' is not checked for null before it is dereferenced.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if 'field' is null before it is used, but this check is done after 'field' has been dereferenced. This means that if 'field' is null, the program will crash when it tries to access 'field->list'.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check for null before dereferencing 'field'. This can be done by moving the check for 'field' to before the dereference. For example: if (field && field->list) {... } else {... }.

use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("key", "value");
    let value = map.get("key");
    println!("{}", value.unwrap());
}
```
