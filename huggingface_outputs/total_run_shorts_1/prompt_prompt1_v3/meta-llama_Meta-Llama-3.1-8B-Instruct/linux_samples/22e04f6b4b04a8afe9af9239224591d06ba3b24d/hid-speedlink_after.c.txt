VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `abs` function on a user-controlled value.
EXPLANATION: The `abs` function is used to check if the absolute value of `value` is greater than or equal to 256. However, if an attacker can control the value of `value`, they can potentially cause a buffer overflow by passing a large negative value. This is because the `abs` function will return a large positive value, which can then be used to access memory outside the bounds of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to check for the "jumpy" cursor condition, such as checking if the value is within a certain range or using a more robust input validation mechanism. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all user-controlled inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks.  The `abs` function should be avoided whenever possible, and instead, the code should use a more secure method to handle user-controlled values.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to
