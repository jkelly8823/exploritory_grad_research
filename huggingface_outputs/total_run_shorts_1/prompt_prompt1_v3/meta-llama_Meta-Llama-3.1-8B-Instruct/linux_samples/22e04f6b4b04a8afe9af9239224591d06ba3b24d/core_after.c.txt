 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The hid_alloc_report_buf function allocates a buffer of size report->size, but the hid_output_report function writes report->size bytes to the buffer. However, the hidp_send_intr_message function writes rsize bytes to the buffer, where rsize is calculated as ((report->size - 1) >> 3) + 1 + (report->id > 0). This can cause a buffer overflow if report->size is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The code allocates a buffer of size report->size, but then writes report->size bytes to the buffer. However, the hidp_send_intr_message function writes rsize bytes to the buffer, where rsize is calculated as ((report->size - 1) >> 3) + 1 + (report->id > 0). This can cause a buffer overflow if report->size is large enough. The hidp_send_intr_message function can write more bytes to the buffer than the buffer was allocated for, which can cause undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure
