VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the repeated use of the same variable name 'val' without proper initialization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'val' is used to store the result of the kstrtoul function, which converts a string to an unsigned long. However, the variable 'val' is reused multiple times without being properly initialized or validated. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if the input string is longer than the buffer size of the 'val' variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the variable 'val' should be properly initialized and validated before reusing it. This can be done by checking the return value of the kstrtoul function and handling the error case. Additionally, the code should be refactored to use a different variable name for each iteration to avoid the reuse of the same variable name. 

Note: The lines mentioned in VULNERABLE_LINES are the lines where the variable 'val' is declared and used.
