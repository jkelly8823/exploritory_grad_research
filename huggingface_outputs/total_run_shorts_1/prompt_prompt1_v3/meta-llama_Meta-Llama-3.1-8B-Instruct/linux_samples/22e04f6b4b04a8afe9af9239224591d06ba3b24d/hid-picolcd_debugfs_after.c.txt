VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The variable 'buff' is not initialized before being used in the'snprintf' function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the report is large.
EXPLANATION: The 'buff' variable is declared as a pointer to a character, but it is not initialized before being used. This can lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overflows. The'snprintf' function is used to format a string into the 'buff' buffer, but it does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. If the size of the report is large, the'snprintf' function may write beyond the bounds of the 'buff' buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The 'buff' variable should be initialized before being used. This can be done by allocating memory for the buffer using'malloc' or 'calloc'. The'snprintf' function should also be modified to check the size of the buffer before writing to it. Additionally, the 'BUFF_SZ' constant should be increased to a larger value to prevent buffer overflows. The'snprintf'
