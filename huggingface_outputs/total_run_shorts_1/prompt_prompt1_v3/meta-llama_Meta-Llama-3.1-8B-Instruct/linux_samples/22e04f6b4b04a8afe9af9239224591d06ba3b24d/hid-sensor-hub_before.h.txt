VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The function hid_sensor_convert_exponent() does not check for integer overflow when converting from hid unit expo to regular exponent. If the input unit_expo is greater than or equal to 0x08, the function returns the value directly without any checks. However, if the input unit_expo is greater than or equal to 0x08 and the maximum value of the return type (int) is exceeded, an integer overflow occurs, leading to incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that the return value does not exceed the maximum value of the return type. For example, you can use the following code: if (unit_expo < 0x08) return unit_expo; else return (int)((uint32_t)unit_expo); This code checks if the input unit_expo is less than 0x08 and returns the value directly. If the input unit_expo is greater than or equal to 0x08, it converts the value to a 32-bit unsigned integer and then casts it to an int, preventing integer overflow.
