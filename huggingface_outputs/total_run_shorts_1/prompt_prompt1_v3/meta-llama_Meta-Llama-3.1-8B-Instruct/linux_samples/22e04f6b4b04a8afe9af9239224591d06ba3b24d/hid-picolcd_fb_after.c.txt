VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The spin_lock_irqsave() function is used to protect the critical section of code, but the spin_unlock_irqrestore() function is not used to release the lock. This can cause a deadlock if another thread attempts to access the lock while it is still held.
EXPLANATION: The spin_lock_irqsave() function is used to acquire the lock and save the current interrupt flags. However, the spin_unlock_irqrestore() function is not used to release the lock and restore the interrupt flags. This can cause a deadlock if another thread attempts to access the lock while it is still held. The spin_unlock_irqrestore() function should be used to release the lock and restore the interrupt flags.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The spin_unlock_irqrestore() function should be used to release the lock and restore the interrupt flags. The corrected code should look like this: spin_unlock_irqrestore(&fbdata->lock, flags);. This will ensure that the lock is released and the interrupt flags are restored, preventing a deadlock.  Additionally, consider using a mutex instead of a spinlock if the critical section of code is not performance-critical
