VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The `buf` array is declared with a size of 2, but it is being used to store the result of `hid_get_raw_report`, which can return a value larger than 2. This can cause the `buf` array to overflow, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `hid_get_raw_report` function is called with a buffer size of 2, but it can return a value larger than 2. This is because the function is designed to return the number of bytes read from the device, which can be greater than the size of the buffer. If the buffer is not large enough to hold the returned value, it will overflow, causing undefined behavior. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the `buf` array should be increased to a value that is large enough to hold the maximum possible return value of `hid_get_raw_report`. Additionally, the code should be modified to check the return value of `hid_get_raw_report`
