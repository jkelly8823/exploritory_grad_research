VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function kye_consumer_control_fixup() does not check the bounds of the rdesc array before accessing it. This allows an attacker to potentially write data beyond the end of the array, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function kye_consumer_control_fixup() takes a pointer to an array of bytes (rdesc) as an argument. It then accesses elements of this array using the offset variable, which is calculated based on the size of the array (rsize). However, it does not check if the offset is within the bounds of the array before accessing it. This means that if the size of the array is large enough, an attacker could potentially write data beyond the end of the array, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function kye_consumer_control_fixup() should check the bounds of the rdesc array before accessing it. This can be
