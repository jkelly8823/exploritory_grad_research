VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the magicmouse_probe function due to the lack of bounds checking on the input string 'val' in the param_set_scroll_speed function.
EXPLANATION: The param_set_scroll_speed function is called from the magicmouse_probe function, and it does not perform any bounds checking on the input string 'val'. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the param_set_scroll_speed function to ensure that the input string 'val' does not exceed a certain length. Additionally, consider using a safer function such as kstrtoul to parse the input string. The corrected code should look like this: if (strict_strtoul(val, 0, &speed) || speed > 63 || strlen(val) > 10) {... }. This will prevent an attacker from overflowing the buffer and executing arbitrary code.
