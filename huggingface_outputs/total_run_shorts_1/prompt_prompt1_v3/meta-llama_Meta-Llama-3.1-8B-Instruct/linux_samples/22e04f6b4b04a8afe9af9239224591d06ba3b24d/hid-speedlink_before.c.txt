VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the value parameter in the hid_process_usage function.
EXPLANATION: The hid_process_usage function does not check if the value parameter is within the valid range of values for the usage parameter. This could potentially allow an attacker to pass in a value that is outside the valid range, causing the function to access memory outside the bounds of the usage_table array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include bounds checking on the value parameter. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the value is within the valid range of values for the usage parameter. For example, the code could be modified to check if the value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the maximum value in the usage_table array. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all other parameters are properly validated to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the usage_table array is properly initialized and bounds checked to prevent buffer overflows.  The code should
