VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the mt_pen_input_configured function. The sprintf function is used to create a string that is then copied into a buffer of size strlen(hi->input->name) + 5. However, the sprintf function does not account for the null terminator, so the buffer may be overflowed if the name is longer than strlen(hi->input->name) + 4.
EXPLANATION: The mt_pen_input_configured function is used to configure the input device for a pen. It creates a new string by appending " Pen" to the end of the input device's name. However, the sprintf function is used to create this string, which does not account for the null terminator. This means that if the input device's name is longer than strlen(hi->input->name) + 4, the buffer will be overflowed, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the sprintf function should be replaced with a safer function, such as snprintf, which accounts for the null terminator. The buffer size should also be increased to account for the null terminator. For example:
