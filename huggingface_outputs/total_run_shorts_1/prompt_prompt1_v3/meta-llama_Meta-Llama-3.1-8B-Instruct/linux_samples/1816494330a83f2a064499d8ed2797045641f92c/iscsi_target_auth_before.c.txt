VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function chap_string_to_hex() does not check the length of the input string before copying it to the destination buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The function chap_string_to_hex() takes three parameters: dst, src, and len. The function copies the input string src to the destination buffer dst, but it does not check the length of the input string before copying it. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer by providing a longer input string than the buffer can hold. The buffer overflow can potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function chap_string_to_hex() should be modified to check the length of the input string before copying it to the destination buffer. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the length of the input string is less than or equal to the
