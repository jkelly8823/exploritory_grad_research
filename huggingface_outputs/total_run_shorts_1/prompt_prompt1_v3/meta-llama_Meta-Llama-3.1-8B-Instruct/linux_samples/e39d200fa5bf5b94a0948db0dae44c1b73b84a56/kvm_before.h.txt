VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A format string vulnerability exists in the TP_printk macro. The vulnerability is due to the use of the __print_symbolic macro, which can lead to a format string attack.
EXPLANATION: The TP_printk macro is used to print the contents of the trace event. However, the macro uses the __print_symbolic macro to print the type field, which can lead to a format string attack. This is because the __print_symbolic macro can be used to inject arbitrary format specifiers into the format string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the TP_printk macro should be modified to use a safer method of printing the type field, such as using a string literal or a format string that is not user-controllable. For example, the macro could be modified to use the following format string: "mmio %s len %u gpa 0x%llx val 0x%llx". This would prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary format specifiers into the format string. Additionally, the __print_symbolic macro should be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to format string attacks. If it is, then it
