VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger header file, and it is restoring the local DAIF (Debug Access Interrupt Flag) state. The `local_daif_restore` function is called with the argument `DAIF_PROCCTX_NOIRQ`, which suggests that the function is being used to restore the DAIF state in a specific context. The `#endif` directive at the end of the snippet indicates that this code is conditionally compiled based on the presence of the `__ARM64_KVM_HOST_H__` macro. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet.  It appears to be a safe and well-structured piece of code.  However, it would be beneficial to review the larger codebase to ensure that this function is being used correctly and that the DAIF state is being properly managed throughout the code.  Additionally, it would be a good idea to consider adding comments to explain the purpose and behavior of this function, especially if it is being used in a complex or critical section of
