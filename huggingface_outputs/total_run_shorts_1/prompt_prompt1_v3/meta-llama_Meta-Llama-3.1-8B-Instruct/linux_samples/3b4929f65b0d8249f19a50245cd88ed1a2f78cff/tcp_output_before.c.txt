 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the skb_availroom(skb) function call.
EXPLANATION: The skb_availroom(skb) function call does not perform any bounds checking on the available room in the skb. This means that if the skb is not large enough to accommodate the requested amount of space, it may lead to a buffer overflow. In this case, the skb_copy_bits function is called with the result of skb_availroom(skb), which can lead to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking on the skb_availroom(skb) function call to ensure that the skb is large enough to accommodate the requested amount of space. This can be done by checking the return value of skb_availroom(skb) and returning an error if it is less than the requested amount of space. Additionally, the skb_copy_bits function should be called with a safe maximum size to prevent buffer overflows. For example: if (skb_availroom(skb) >= next_skb_size) { skb_copy_bits(next_skb, 0, skb_put(skb, next_skb_size), next_skb_size);
