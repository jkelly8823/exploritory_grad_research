 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a graphics driver, specifically handling context switching and media pool state commands. It uses the gen8_emit_flush_coherentl3_wa and emit_lri functions to generate a batch of commands. The HAS_POOLED_EU check is used to determine if the engine supports pooled EU. No obvious vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be well-structured and follows standard practices. However, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of the WaMediaPoolStateCmdInWABB and WaFlushCoherentL3CacheLinesAtContextSwitch workarounds. This would improve code readability and maintainability.  ```
