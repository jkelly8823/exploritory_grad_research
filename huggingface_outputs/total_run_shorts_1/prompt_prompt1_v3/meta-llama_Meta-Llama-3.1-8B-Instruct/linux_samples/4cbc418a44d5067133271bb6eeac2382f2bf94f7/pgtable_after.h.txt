VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function pmd_access_permitted() is not defined, but it is being called in the macro pte_access_permitted(). This can lead to undefined behavior if pmd_access_permitted() is not properly implemented.
EXPLANATION: The function pmd_access_permitted() is not defined in the given code snippet. However, it is being called in the macro pte_access_permitted(). This can lead to undefined behavior if pmd_access_permitted() is not properly implemented. The function pmd_access_permitted() is supposed to check if a page directory entry is accessible, but without its definition, it is unclear how this check is being performed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function pmd_access_permitted() should be defined and implemented properly. It should check if a page directory entry is accessible based on the given write permission. The definition of pmd_access_permitted() should be added to the code snippet. Additionally, the macro pte_access_permitted() should be updated to call the properly defined function pmd_access_permitted().  The code should be reviewed to ensure that pmd_access_permitted() is being used correctly throughout the
