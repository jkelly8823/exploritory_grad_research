 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of mutex_lock and mutex_unlock in a way that allows another thread to access the rtc->lock while it is still locked.
EXPLANATION: The mutex_lock is called on rtc->lock, but then the function mtk_rtc_write_trigger(rtc) is called which may also try to access rtc->lock. This can cause a deadlock or a race condition if another thread is waiting to access rtc->lock. The mutex_unlock is called after the function call, but this does not guarantee that the lock is released before the function call returns.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the mutex_lock should be called before the function call, and the mutex_unlock should be called after the function call. This will ensure that the lock is released before the function call returns, preventing a deadlock or race condition. Alternatively, the function call can be moved inside the mutex_lock block to ensure that it is executed while the lock is held.
