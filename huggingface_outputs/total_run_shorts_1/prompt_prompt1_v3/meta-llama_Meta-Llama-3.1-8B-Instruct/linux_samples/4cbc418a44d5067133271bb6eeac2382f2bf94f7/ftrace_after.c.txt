VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of stddev.
EXPLANANATION: The calculation of stddev involves multiplying rec->counter by (rec->counter - 1) and then multiplying the result by 1000. If rec->counter is large enough, this multiplication could result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect value for stddev.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a larger data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the result of the multiplication. Alternatively, you could use a library function that is designed to handle large integers, such as the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). Additionally, you could add a check to ensure that the result of the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a 32-bit integer.
