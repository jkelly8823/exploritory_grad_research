 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the len parameter.
EXPLANATION: The len parameter is not checked to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed size for the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the len parameter is larger than the actual size of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the len parameter does not exceed the maximum allowed size for the buffer. This can be done by checking if len is less than or equal to the size of the buffer before accessing it. For example: if (len > s->seq.len) return -1; or similar. Additionally, consider using a safer function to copy the data, such as memcpy, to prevent potential buffer overflows.  Also, consider using a safer function to check the length of the buffer, such as strlen, to prevent potential buffer overflows.
