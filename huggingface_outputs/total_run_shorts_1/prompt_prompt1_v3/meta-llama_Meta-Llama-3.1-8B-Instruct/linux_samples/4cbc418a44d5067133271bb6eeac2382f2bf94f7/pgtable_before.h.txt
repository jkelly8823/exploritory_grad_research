VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function pmd_access_permitted() is not defined, which could lead to a null pointer dereference or other undefined behavior when it is called.
EXPLANATION: The function pmd_access_permitted() is declared but not defined. This could lead to a null pointer dereference or other undefined behavior when it is called. The function is supposed to check if a page map directory entry has access permitted, but without a definition, it is impossible to know what the function actually does.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function pmd_access_permitted() should be defined with the correct logic to check if a page map directory entry has access permitted. The definition should be placed in the same file or a header file that is included by the file that calls this function. The function should be called with the correct arguments, and the return value should be checked to ensure that it is valid. Additionally, the function should be checked for any potential null pointer dereferences or other undefined behavior.  The function should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly implemented and that it does not have any security vulnerabilities.  The function should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly
