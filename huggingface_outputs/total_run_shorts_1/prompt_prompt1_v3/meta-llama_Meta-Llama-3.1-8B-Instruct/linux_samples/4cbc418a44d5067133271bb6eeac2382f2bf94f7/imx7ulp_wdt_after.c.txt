VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite loop
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains an infinite loop that will cause the program to hang indefinitely. This is a vulnerability because it can cause the system to become unresponsive and potentially lead to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the infinite loop with a conditional statement that checks for a specific condition to break out of the loop. For example, you could add a counter variable and increment it in each iteration, then check if it has reached a certain threshold before breaking out of the loop. Alternatively, you could use a timer to limit the number of iterations and break out of the loop when the timer expires.  ```c
while (counter < 1000) {
    // do something
    counter++;
}
``` or ```c
struct timer_list timer;
init_timer(&timer);
timer.expires = jiffies + HZ;
add_timer(&timer);
while (true) {
    // do something
    if (timer_expired(&timer)) {
        break;
    }
}
