VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the number of bytes to be sent is greater than the available space in the FIFO. This can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code calculates the number of bytes to be sent to fill the FIFO, but it does not check if this number is greater than the available space in the FIFO. If the number of bytes to be sent is greater than the available space, the code will continue to send bytes beyond the end of the FIFO, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if the number of bytes to be sent is greater than the available space in the FIFO before sending the bytes. This can be done by checking if `fill_bytes` is greater than `fifo_threshold`. If it is, the code should not send the bytes and instead return an error. Alternatively, the code could be modified to use a more robust method of filling the FIFO, such as using a circular buffer. 

Note: The lines 14-15 refer to the lines where the `val` is written to the register, which is where the vulnerability is introduced. The `
