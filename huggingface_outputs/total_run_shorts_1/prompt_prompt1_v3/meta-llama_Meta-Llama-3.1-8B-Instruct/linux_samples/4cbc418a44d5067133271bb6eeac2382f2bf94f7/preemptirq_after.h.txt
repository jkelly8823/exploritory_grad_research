VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the caller_offs and parent_offs fields.
EXPLANATION: The code calculates the caller_offs and parent_offs fields by subtracting the address of _stext from the addresses of ip and parent_ip, respectively. However, this calculation does not take into account the possibility of the resulting values being negative or exceeding the bounds of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking to ensure that the caller_offs and parent_offs fields do not exceed the bounds of the buffer. This can be done by checking if the calculated values are within the valid range before assigning them to the fields. Additionally, consider using a safer method to calculate the offsets, such as using a pointer arithmetic library function.  The code should also consider using a safer method to print the addresses, such as using a pointer-to-pointer cast.
