VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ext4_iget_extra_inode function. The function does not properly validate the size of the raw_inode structure before accessing it, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the structure is larger than expected.
EXPLANATION: The function assumes that the raw_inode structure is at least EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE bytes in size, but it does not check if the actual size of the structure is larger than this. If the structure is larger, the function will access memory outside the bounds of the structure, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to properly validate the size of the raw_inode structure before accessing it. This can be done by checking the size of the structure using the EXT4_INODE_SIZE function and ensuring that it is at least EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE bytes in size. If the size is larger, the function should return an error or handle the situation accordingly. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it does not access memory outside the bounds of the structure in any other way.
