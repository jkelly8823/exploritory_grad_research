VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Using a kernel pointer in place of a dma_addr_t token can lead to undefined behavior if that makes it into cache management functions.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to undefined behavior due to the use of a kernel pointer (arvif->beacon_buf) in place of a dma_addr_t token. This can lead to issues if the pointer is used in cache management functions. The comment in the code snippet itself highlights this issue and suggests using a known-invalid address token instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the kernel pointer with a dma_addr_t token, specifically DMA_MAPPING_ERROR, to avoid undefined behavior. This can be done by changing the line arvif->beacon_buf = kmalloc(IEEE80211_MAX_FRAME_LEN, GFP_KERNEL); to arvif->beacon_buf = dma_alloc_coherent(ar->dev, IEEE80211_MAX_FRAME_LEN, &arvif->beacon_paddr, GFP_KERNEL);. This will ensure that the correct type of pointer is used and avoid potential issues.  The line arvif->beacon_paddr = DMA_MAPPING_ERROR; should be removed as it is no longer needed
