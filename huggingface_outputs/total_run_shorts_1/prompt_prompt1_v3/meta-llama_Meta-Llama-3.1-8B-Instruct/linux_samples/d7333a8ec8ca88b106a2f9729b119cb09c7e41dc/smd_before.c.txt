VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data from the `buf` parameter to the `wcn->hal_buf` buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `memcpy` function is used to copy `len` bytes from the `buf` parameter to the `wcn->hal_buf` buffer. However, there is no check to ensure that `len` is within the bounds of the `wcn->hal_buf` buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `len` is greater than the size of the `wcn->hal_buf` buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that `len` is within the bounds of the `wcn->hal_buf` buffer before copying data. This can be done by checking if `len` is less than or equal to the size of the `wcn->hal_buf` buffer. If it is not, return an error or handle the situation accordingly. For example: `if (len > wcn->hal_buf_size) { return -EINVAL; }` before the `memcpy` function call. Additionally
