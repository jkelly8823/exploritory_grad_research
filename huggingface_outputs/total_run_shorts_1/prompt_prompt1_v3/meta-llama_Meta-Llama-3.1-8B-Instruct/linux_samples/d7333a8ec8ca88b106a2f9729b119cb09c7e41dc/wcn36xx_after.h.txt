 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the major version number.
EXPLANATION: The function wcn36xx_is_fw_version takes a major version number as an argument, but it does not check if the major version number is within a valid range. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker were to pass in an invalid major version number.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to include bounds checking on the major version number. This could be done by checking if the major version number is within a valid range (e.g. 0-255) before proceeding with the function. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle invalid major version numbers in a secure manner, such as by returning an error code or aborting the function. 

Note: The actual fix would depend on the specific requirements of the function and the system it is a part of. The above recommendation is just one possible solution. 

Also, the code snippet seems to be a part of a larger system, and the function wcn36xx_is_fw_version is likely used to check the firmware
