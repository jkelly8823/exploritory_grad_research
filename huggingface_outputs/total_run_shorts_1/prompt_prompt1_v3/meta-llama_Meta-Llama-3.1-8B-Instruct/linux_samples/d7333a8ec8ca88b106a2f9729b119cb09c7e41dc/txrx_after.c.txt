 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking in the `wcn36xx_set_tx_pdu` function.
EXPLANATION: The `wcn36xx_set_tx_pdu` function does not check the length of the `mpdu_header_len` parameter, which can lead to a buffer overflow if a large value is passed. This can potentially allow an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack, leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `wcn36xx_set_tx_pdu` function should be modified to check the length of the `mpdu_header_len` parameter and ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed value. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other types of attacks.
