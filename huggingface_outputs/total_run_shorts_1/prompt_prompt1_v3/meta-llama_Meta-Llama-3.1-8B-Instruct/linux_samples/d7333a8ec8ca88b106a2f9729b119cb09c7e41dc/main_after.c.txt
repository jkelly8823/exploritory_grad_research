VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference when the `get_feat_caps` function returns false and the `hw_req` pointer is null.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if `get_feat_caps` returns false, but it does not check if `hw_req` is null before using it. If `hw_req` is null, the code will attempt to access its members, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if `hw_req` is null before using it, and return an error if it is. The `get_feat_caps` function should also be modified to return an error if `hw_req` is null.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference when the `wcn36xx_smd_update_channel_list` function is called with a null `hw_req` pointer.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if `hw_req->req.n_channels > 48`, but it does not check if `hw_req` is null before using it. If `
