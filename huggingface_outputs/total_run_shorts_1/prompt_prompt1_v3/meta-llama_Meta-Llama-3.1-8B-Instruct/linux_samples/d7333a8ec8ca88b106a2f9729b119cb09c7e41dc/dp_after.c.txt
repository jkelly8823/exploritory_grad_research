VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the rx_buf_rbm parameter.
EXPLANATION: The function ath11k_dp_rxbufs_replenish is called with the rx_buf_rbm parameter, which is not checked for its size before being used to replenish the rx_refill_buf_ring. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of rx_buf_rbm is larger than the size of the ring buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the rx_buf_rbm parameter to ensure it does not exceed the size of the ring buffer. This can be done by checking the size of rx_buf_rbm against the size of the ring buffer before replenishing it. For example: if (rx_buf_rbm < rx_ring->size) {... } else {... }. Additionally, consider using a safer function that does not require manual bounds checking.  The function ath11k_dp_rxbufs_replenish should also be reviewed to ensure it does not have any other vulnerabilities.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the rx_buf_rbm parameter is not being set to an invalid
