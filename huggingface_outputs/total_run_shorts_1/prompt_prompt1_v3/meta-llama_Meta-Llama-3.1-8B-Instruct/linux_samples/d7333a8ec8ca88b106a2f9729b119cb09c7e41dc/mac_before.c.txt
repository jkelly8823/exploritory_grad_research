VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The `arvif->beacon_buf` pointer is being assigned a new value in the `else` branch, but the original value is not being freed. This can lead to a use-after-free bug if the original buffer is freed before the new buffer is used.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is allocating memory for the `beacon_buf` using `kmalloc` in the `if` branch, but in the `else` branch, it is using `dma_alloc_coherent` to allocate memory. The `kmalloc` allocated memory is not being freed, and the `dma_alloc_coherent` allocated memory is being assigned to the `beacon_buf` pointer. This can lead to a use-after-free bug if the `kmalloc` allocated memory is freed before the `dma_alloc_coherent` allocated memory is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `kmalloc` allocated memory should be freed in the `else` branch before assigning the new buffer to the `beacon_buf` pointer. Alternatively, the `kmalloc` allocated memory can be freed in the
