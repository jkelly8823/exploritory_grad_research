VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the major version number.
EXPLANATION: The function wcn36xx_is_fw_version takes a major version number as an argument, but it does not check if the major version number is within a valid range. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker were to pass in an invalid major version number.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check if the major version number is within a valid range before using it. This can be done by adding a simple bounds check, such as if (major < 1 || major > 255) return false;. Additionally, it would be a good idea to validate the major version number against a known valid range to prevent potential issues.  The function should also be modified to handle the case where the major version number is not a valid integer. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that major is an integer before using it.  The function should also be modified to handle the case where the major version number is not a valid value. This can be done by adding a
