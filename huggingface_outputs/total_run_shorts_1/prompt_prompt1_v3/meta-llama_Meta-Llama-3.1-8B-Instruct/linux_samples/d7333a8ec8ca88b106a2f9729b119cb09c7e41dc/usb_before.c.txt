VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the ath6kl_usb_get_logical_pipe_num function.
EXPLANANATION:
The ath6kl_usb_get_logical_pipe_num function does not check the size of the buffer before writing to it. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the buffer is not sufficient to hold the data being written to it.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the size of the buffer before writing to it.
2. Use a safer function to write to the buffer, such as snprintf.
3. Consider using a more secure function to get the logical pipe number, such as one that uses a safer method to retrieve the data.
