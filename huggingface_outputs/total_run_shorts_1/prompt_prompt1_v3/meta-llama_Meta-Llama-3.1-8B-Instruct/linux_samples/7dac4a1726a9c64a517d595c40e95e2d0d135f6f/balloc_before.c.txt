VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the block bitmap block number is not set, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The function ext4_read_block_bitmap_nowait() does not check if the block bitmap block number is valid before attempting to access it. If the block bitmap block number is not set, the function will return a null pointer, which will then be dereferenced when calling sb_getblk(). This can lead to a null pointer dereference and potentially cause the system to crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function ext4_read_block_bitmap_nowait() should be modified to check if the block bitmap block number is valid before attempting to access it. This can be done by checking if the block bitmap block number is greater than or equal to 0 before calling sb_getblk(). If the block bitmap block number is not valid, the function should return an error code instead of attempting to access the block bitmap. For example: if (bitmap_blk < 0) return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where the block bitmap block number is not set, by checking
