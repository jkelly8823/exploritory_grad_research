VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a fallthrough vulnerability. This occurs when a switch statement does not properly handle all possible cases, allowing execution to continue into the next case.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement in this code snippet is not properly handling all possible cases. The first switch statement has a case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2, but the second switch statement also has a case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2. This is a fallthrough vulnerability because the second switch statement does not properly handle the case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2, allowing execution to continue into the next case.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the second switch statement should be modified to properly handle the case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2. This can be done by adding a break statement after the case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2, or by removing the case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2 from the second switch statement. Additionally, the first switch statement should be modified to properly handle all possible cases, including the default case. This can be done by adding a break statement after the case for BPF_LIRC_MODE2, or by removing the
