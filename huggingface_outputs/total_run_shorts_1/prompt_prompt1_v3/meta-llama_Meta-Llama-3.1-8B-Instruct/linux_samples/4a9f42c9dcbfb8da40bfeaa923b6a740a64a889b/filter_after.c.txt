VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains multiple instances of a vulnerability where the `bpf_ctx_range` and `bpf_ctx_range_till` functions are used without proper validation of the `size` parameter. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `bpf_ctx_range` and `bpf_ctx_range_till` functions are used to access specific fields within the `__sk_buff` structure. However, the `size` parameter is not properly validated, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This is because the `size` parameter is not checked to ensure it matches the expected size of the field being accessed. If the `size` parameter is larger than the expected size, it can cause the program to access memory outside the bounds of the field, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `size` parameter should be validated to ensure it matches the expected size of the field being accessed. This
