VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the key_count variable.
EXPLANATION: The key_count variable is used to index into the key array, but there is no check to ensure that key_count is within the bounds of the array. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if key_count is larger than the size of the key array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a bounds check to ensure that key_count is within the bounds of the key array before indexing into the key array. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if key_count is less than or equal to the size of the key array. For example: if (key_count <= key_size) {... } else {... } where key_size is the size of the key array. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability.  Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a vector or a list to store the key array, which would eliminate the need for manual bounds checking.  Also, consider using a safer function to copy the key array, such as memcpy, to prevent potential buffer overflows.  It is also recommended to use
