VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size array (KVM_MAX_NESTED_GUESTS) to store pointers to dynamically allocated objects (struct kvm_nested_guest).
EXPLANATION: The fixed-size array (KVM_MAX_NESTED_GUESTS) is used to store pointers to dynamically allocated objects (struct kvm_nested_guest). If the number of nested guests exceeds KVM_MAX_NESTED_GUESTS, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically-sized data structure, such as a linked list or a dynamically-allocated array, to store the pointers to the nested guests. Additionally, consider implementing bounds checking to prevent the buffer overflow. The code should be modified to dynamically allocate memory for the nested guests based on the actual number of guests, rather than relying on a fixed-size array. This will prevent the buffer overflow and ensure the code is more secure.  The code should also be modified to handle the case where the number of nested guests exceeds KVM_MAX_NESTED_GUESTS, by either dynamically
