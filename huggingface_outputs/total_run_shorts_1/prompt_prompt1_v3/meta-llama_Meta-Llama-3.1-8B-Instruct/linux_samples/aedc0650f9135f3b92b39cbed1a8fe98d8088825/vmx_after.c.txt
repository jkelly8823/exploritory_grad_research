VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is freed in the `free_vmcs` label, but it is still used in the `free_pml` label.
EXPLANATION: The `free_vmcs` label is executed when an error occurs during the allocation of the `vmx->vmcs01` loaded VMCS. In this case, the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is freed. However, the `free_pml` label is also executed when an error occurs during the destruction of the PML buffer. In this case, the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is still used, even though it has been freed. This is a use-after-free vulnerability, as the code is attempting to access memory that has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is not used after it has been freed. One possible solution is to introduce a flag to indicate whether the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer has been freed,
