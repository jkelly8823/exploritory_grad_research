VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the repeated calls to kfree(wr_buf) without checking if wr_buf is NULL. This can lead to a double free error if wr_buf is NULL.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if wr_buf is NULL at the beginning, but then proceeds to call kfree(wr_buf) multiple times without checking if wr_buf is NULL. This can lead to a double free error if wr_buf is NULL. The correct approach would be to check if wr_buf is NULL before calling kfree(wr_buf).
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Remove the repeated calls to kfree(wr_buf) and only call it once after the last check.
2. Add a check to ensure that wr_buf is not NULL before calling kfree(wr_buf). 
3. Consider using a more robust memory management approach, such as using a smart pointer or a container that automatically manages memory
