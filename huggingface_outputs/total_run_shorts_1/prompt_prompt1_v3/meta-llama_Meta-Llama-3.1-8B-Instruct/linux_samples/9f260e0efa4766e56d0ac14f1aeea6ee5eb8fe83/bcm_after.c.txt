VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the use of sprintf() function without checking the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The sprintf() function is used to format a string and store it in the procname buffer. However, the buffer size is fixed at 32 characters, and the sprintf() function does not check the buffer size before writing to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the formatted string is longer than the buffer size, potentially causing a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the snprintf() function instead of sprintf(), which allows for specifying the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer. For example, snprintf(bo->procname, sizeof(bo->procname), "%lu", sock_i_ino(sk));. Additionally, consider using a safer function like asprintf() or snprintf() with a fixed format string to avoid potential format string vulnerabilities.  Also, consider checking the return value of proc_create_data() to ensure that the file was created successfully.  Finally, consider using a more secure way to create the file, such as using a unique filename that is not easily guessable.  This will help
