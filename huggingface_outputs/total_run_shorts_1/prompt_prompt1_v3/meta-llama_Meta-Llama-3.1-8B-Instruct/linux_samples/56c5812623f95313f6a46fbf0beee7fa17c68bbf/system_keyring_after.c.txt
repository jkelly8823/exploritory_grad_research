VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. If the trusted_keys list is empty, the function pkcs7_validate_trust() will be called with a null pointer, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the trusted_keys list is empty before calling pkcs7_validate_trust(). However, it does not check if the trusted_keys list is null before calling pkcs7_validate_trust(). If the trusted_keys list is null, the function will be called with a null pointer, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check if the trusted_keys list is null before calling pkcs7_validate_trust(). This can be done by adding a null check before the function call. For example: if (trusted_keys!= NULL) { ret = pkcs7_validate_trust(pkcs7, trusted_keys);... } else {... }. This will prevent the potential null pointer dereference.  ---
