VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet is a simple header inclusion and a declaration of an external constant array. There are no potential security risks or vulnerabilities present in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a standard and safe declaration of an external constant array.  The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security risks.  The use of the `__initconst` attribute suggests that the array is intended to be initialized at compile-time, which further reduces the risk of any potential vulnerabilities.  Overall, this code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any modifications.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it aligns with the project's coding standards and best practices.  Additionally, it is essential to verify that the external constant array is properly initialized and that the `blacklist_hashes` array is correctly defined in the external source file.  But these are general best practices and not specific to this code snippet.  The code itself appears to be secure.  It is worth noting
