VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  There are no vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The code appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module and is using the provided kernel APIs correctly. The code snippet is initializing two tables, __cachemode2pte_tbl and __pte2cachemode_tbl, which are used to map cache modes to page table entries and vice versa. The code is using the provided kernel APIs to perform this mapping. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and safe. 
```python
def get_user_space_memory():
    # Get the user space memory
    user_space_memory = []
    for i in range(0, 1024):
        user_space_memory.append(i)
    return user_space_memory

def get_kernel_space_memory():
    # Get the kernel space memory
    kernel_space_memory = []
    for i in range(0, 1024):
        kernel_space_memory.append(i)
    return kernel_space_memory
