VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module. It contains two functions: `pages` and `mprotect_fixup`. The `pages` function simply returns a value without any apparent vulnerability. The `mprotect_fixup` function is a kernel function that appears to be related to memory protection. It takes several parameters, including a `struct vm_area_struct` pointer, and returns an integer value. However, the function body is empty, which may indicate a missing implementation. Nevertheless, there are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None.  The code appears to be a part of a larger kernel module, and the missing implementation of the `mprotect_fixup` function may be intentional. Further context is required to determine the correct implementation.  However, it is recommended to add a comment or a check to ensure that the function is properly implemented before returning.  This can be done by adding a check to see if the function has been implemented, and if not, return an error code.  For example: ```c
