VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a ternary operator to append a suffix to a string.
EXPLANATION: The ternary operator is used to append a suffix to the string representation of num_nodes and num_cpus. However, if the values of num_nodes or num_cpus are very large, the resulting string could potentially exceed the maximum buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method to append the suffix, such as using the sprintf function or a string library that handles buffer sizes correctly. For example: char buffer[1024]; sprintf(buffer, "%d%s", num_nodes, num_nodes > 1? "s" : "");. Alternatively, use a string library that handles buffer sizes correctly, such as std::string in C++.  ```c
char* get_node_info(int num_nodes) {
    char* node_info = malloc(sizeof(char) * 1024);
    if (num_nodes > 1) {
        sprintf(node_info, "%d nodes", num_nodes);
    } else {
        sprintf(node_info, "%d node", num_nodes);
    }
    return node_info;
