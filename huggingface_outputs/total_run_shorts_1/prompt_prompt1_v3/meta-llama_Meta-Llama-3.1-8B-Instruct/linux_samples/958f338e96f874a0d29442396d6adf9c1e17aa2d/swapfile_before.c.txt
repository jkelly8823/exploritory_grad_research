VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of maxpages.
EXPLANANATION: The calculation of maxpages involves adding 1 to the result of swp_offset(pte_to_swp_entry(swp_entry_to_pte(swp_entry(0, ~0UL)))) which can potentially cause an integer overflow if the result is the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned long. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the calculation of maxpages should be changed to use a safe integer type such as size_t or uint64_t to prevent integer overflow. Additionally, the result of the calculation should be checked to ensure it is within the valid range before using it. For example: size_t maxpages = swp_offset(pte_to_swp_entry(swp_entry_to_pte(swp_entry(0, ~0UL)))) + 1; if (maxpages > UINT_MAX) { pr_warn("Integer overflow in maxpages calculation\n"); return 0; } .
