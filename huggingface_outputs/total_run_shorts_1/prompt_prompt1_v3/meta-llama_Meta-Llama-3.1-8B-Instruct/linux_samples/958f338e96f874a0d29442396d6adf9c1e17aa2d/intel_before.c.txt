VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. This is because the function `check_mpx_erratum` is called without checking if the pointer `c` is null.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference because the function `check_mpx_erratum` is called without checking if the pointer `c` is null. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior if `c` is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Add a null check before calling `check_mpx_erratum`. For example: `if (c!= NULL) { check_mpx_err
