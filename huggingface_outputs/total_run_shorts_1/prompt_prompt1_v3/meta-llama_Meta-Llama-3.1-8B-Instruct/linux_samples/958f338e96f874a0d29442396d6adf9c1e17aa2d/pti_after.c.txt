VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a kernel module and is using a custom logging macro to format the log messages. The macro `pr_fmt` is being redefined to include a prefix for the log messages. This is a common practice in kernel development to provide context to the log messages.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is using the `pr_fmt` macro to format the log messages. This macro is being redefined to include a prefix for the log messages. The prefix is "Kernel/User page tables isolation: ". This is a common practice in kernel development to provide context to the log messages. The code snippet is also including various kernel headers, which suggests that it is a kernel module.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. The use of a custom logging macro is a common practice in kernel development and does not pose any security risks. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that the logging macro is properly defined and used throughout the code.  ```bash
