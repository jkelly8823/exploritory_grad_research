VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715) attack due to the lack of proper mitigation for the SPEC_STORE_BYPASS bug.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it does not properly mitigate the SPEC_STORE_BYPASS bug, which allows an attacker to bypass the branch predictor and access sensitive data. The `ssb_select_mitigation()` function is called, but it does not guarantee that the mitigation is effective. Additionally, the `cpu_show_common()` function does not properly handle the SPEC_STORE_BYPASS bug, allowing an attacker to access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly mitigate the SPEC_STORE_BYPASS bug by using the `x86_amd_ssb_disable()` function to disable the SSBD (Speculative Store Bypass Disable) feature. Additionally, the `cpu_show_common()` function should be modified to properly handle the SPEC_STORE_BYPASS bug by checking the `boot_cpu_has_bug()` function before accessing sensitive data. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all necessary mitigations are in place to
