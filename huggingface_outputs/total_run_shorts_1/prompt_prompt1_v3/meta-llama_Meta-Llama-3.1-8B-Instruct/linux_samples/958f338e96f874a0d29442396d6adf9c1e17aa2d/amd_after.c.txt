VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the line where c->cpu_core_id is assigned a value. The expression c->cpu_core_id %= cus_per_node can cause an integer overflow if cus_per_node is 0, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that cus_per_node is not 0 before performing the modulo operation. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if cus_per_node is greater than 0 before the modulo operation. For example: if (cus_per_node > 0) c->cpu_core_id %= cus_per_node; else c->cpu_core_id = 0; This will prevent the integer overflow and ensure that the code behaves correctly.
