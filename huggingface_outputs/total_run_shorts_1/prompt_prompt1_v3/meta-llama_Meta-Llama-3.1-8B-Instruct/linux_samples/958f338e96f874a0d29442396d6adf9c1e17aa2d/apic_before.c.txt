VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of an array with a variable size (NR_CPUS) without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses an array with a variable size (NR_CPUS) without bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This is because the array is declared with a variable size, and the compiler may not perform bounds checking on the array access. This can be exploited by an attacker to write data beyond the end of the array, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a fixed-size array or implement bounds checking on the array access. Additionally, the use of a variable size without bounds checking is a code smell and should be avoided. The code should be reviewed to ensure that all array accesses are properly checked for bounds. The use of a fixed-size array or a safer data structure, such as a vector or a list, is recommended. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the NR_CPUS variable is properly initialized and validated before use.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the array is not
