 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4, 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The clear_page_presence function is not thread-safe. It is possible for multiple threads to concurrently call clear_page_presence and set the page presence bits in a way that causes the page to be marked as present when it should be marked as absent, or vice versa.
EXPLANATION: The clear_page_presence function calls clear_pmd_presence and clear_pte_presence, which are not thread-safe. These functions modify the page presence bits in a way that is not atomic. If multiple threads call clear_page_presence concurrently, it is possible for the page presence bits to be set in a way that causes the page to be marked as present when it should be marked as absent, or vice versa. This can lead to a race condition that causes the page to be incorrectly marked as present or absent.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the clear_page_presence function should be made thread-safe. This can be done by using a lock to ensure that only one thread can call clear_page_presence at a time. The clear_pmd_presence and clear_pte_presence functions should also be made thread
