 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition when performing PROT_NONE PFN permission checks. This is because the prot_none_walk function is called without proper synchronization, allowing other threads to modify the memory mapping while the check is being performed.
EXPLANATION: The prot_none_walk function is called without any synchronization mechanism, which means that other threads can modify the memory mapping while the check is being performed. This can lead to a race condition, where the check is performed on an outdated mapping, resulting in incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the prot_none_walk function should be called with proper synchronization, such as using a spinlock or a mutex to protect the memory mapping. This will ensure that the check is performed on the most up-to-date mapping, preventing the race condition. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all memory mappings are properly synchronized before performing PROT_NONE PFN permission checks.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the prot_none_walk function is not called concurrently by multiple threads.  If it is, then the code should be modified to use a lock to protect the prot_none_walk function.
