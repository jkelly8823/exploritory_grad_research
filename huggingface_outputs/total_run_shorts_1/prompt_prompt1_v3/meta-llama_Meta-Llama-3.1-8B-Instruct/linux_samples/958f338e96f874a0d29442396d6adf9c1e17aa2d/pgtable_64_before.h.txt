VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow when calculating the offset of a swap entry.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the macro `SWP_OFFSET_FIRST_BIT` to calculate the offset of a swap entry. However, this macro is defined as `(SWP_TYPE_FIRST_BIT + SWP_TYPE_BITS)`, which can potentially overflow if `SWP_TYPE_FIRST_BIT` and `SWP_TYPE_BITS` are large enough. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to calculate the offset, such as using a separate variable to store the result of the addition and checking for overflow before using the result. Alternatively, the code can use a library function that is designed to handle integer arithmetic safely. For example, the code can use the `__builtin_add_overflow` function to check for overflow before performing the addition. The corrected code would look like this:
```c
#define SWP_OFFSET_FIRST_BIT (SWP_TYPE_FIRST_BIT + SWP_TYPE_BITS)

...

#define __swp_offset(x)			((x).val >> (SWP_OFFSET_FIRST_BIT))
