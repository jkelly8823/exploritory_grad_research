 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential L1TF (Foreshadow) attack. This is because the code allows an unprivileged user to set high MMIO mappings to PROT_NONE, which can be used to invert the mapping and point to valid memory, potentially allowing an attacker to read sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the boot CPU has the L1TF bug, and if the requested protection is not invertible. However, it does not check if the user has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability before allowing the modification. This allows an unprivileged user to set the mapping to PROT_NONE, which can be used to invert the mapping and point to valid memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if the user has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability before allowing the modification. This can be done by adding a check for capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) before allowing the modification. Additionally, the code should consider disabling the root override for locked down kernels. This can be done by adding a check for the locked down kernel condition and returning false if it is met. 

Note: The code is vulnerable to a potential L1TF (Foreshadow)
