VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file for x86-64 architecture, specifically dealing with 2-level page tables. It defines two macros, __pte_to_swp_entry and __swp_entry_to_pte, which seem to be used for converting between page table entries (pte) and swap entries (swp_entry_t). The code looks clean and does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a header file, which means it is intended to be included in other source files. The macros defined here are likely used for low-level memory management and page table manipulation. The use of bitfields and casting to specific types suggests that the code is dealing with hardware-specific details. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other common issues. However, it's worth noting that the code is highly architecture-specific and may not be portable to other platforms.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be correct and does not require any changes. However, it's always a good practice to review and test the code on different platforms to ensure
