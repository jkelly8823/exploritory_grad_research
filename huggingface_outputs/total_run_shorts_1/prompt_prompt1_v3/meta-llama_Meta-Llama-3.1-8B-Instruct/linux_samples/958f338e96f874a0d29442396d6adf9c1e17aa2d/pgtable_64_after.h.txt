VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of a macro that shifts the offset up "too far" by TYPE bits, then down again, which can lead to an incorrect calculation of the offset.
EXPLANATION: The macro __swp_entry(type, offset) shifts the offset up by SWP_OFFSET_SHIFT bits, which is equal to (SWP_OFFSET_FIRST_BIT+SWP_TYPE_BITS). However, it then shifts the result down by SWP_TYPE_BITS bits, which can lead to an incorrect calculation of the offset if the offset is large. This can cause a buffer overflow when the offset is used to access memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the macro __swp_entry(type, offset) should be modified to correctly calculate the offset by shifting it up by SWP_OFFSET_SHIFT bits and then down by the correct number of bits to get the correct offset. The correct number of bits to shift down can be calculated as (64 - SWP_TYPE_BITS - SWP_OFFSET_SHIFT). The modified macro should be: #define __swp_entry(type, offset) ((swp_entry_t) { (~((
