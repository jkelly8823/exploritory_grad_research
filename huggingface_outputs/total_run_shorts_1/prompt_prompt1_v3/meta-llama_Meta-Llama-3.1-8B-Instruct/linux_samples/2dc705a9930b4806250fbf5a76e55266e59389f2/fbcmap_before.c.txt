VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The size of the data to be copied is calculated based on the length of the source and destination buffers, but it does not account for the possibility of the source buffer being shorter than the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow when copying data from the source buffer to the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code calculates the size of the data to be copied by subtracting the offset from the length of the destination buffer and the length of the source buffer. However, it does not check if the source buffer is shorter than the destination buffer. If the source buffer is shorter, the calculated size will be larger than the actual size of the data to be copied, leading to a buffer overflow when copying data from the source buffer to the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the source buffer is shorter than the destination buffer before calculating the size of the data to be copied. If the source buffer is shorter, the size should be set to the length of the source buffer. Additionally, the code should use a
