VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function allow_read_from_user() does not check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before allowing the read operation. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the user is not allowed to access the memory location.
EXPLANATION: The function allow_read_from_user() takes two parameters: from and size. However, it does not check if the user is allowed to access the memory location pointed to by from. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the user is not allowed to access the memory location. The function should check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before allowing the read operation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function allow_read_from_user() should be modified to check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before allowing the read operation. This can be done by calling the function prevent_user_access() before allowing the read operation. The function should also check the return value of prevent_user_access() to ensure that the user is allowed to access the memory location. If the user is not allowed to access the memory location, the function should return an error. The modified function should look like this: static inline void allow_read
