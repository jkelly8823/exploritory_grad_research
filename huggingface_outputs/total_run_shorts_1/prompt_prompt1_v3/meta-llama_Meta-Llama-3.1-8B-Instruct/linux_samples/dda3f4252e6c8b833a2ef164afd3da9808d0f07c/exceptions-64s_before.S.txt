VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-8, 15-22, 29-36
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential data corruption issue due to the use of the `srdi` instruction to unroll the loop. The `srdi` instruction is used to unroll the loop by a factor of 8, but it does not properly handle the case where the loop counter is not a multiple of 8. This can lead to data corruption and incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The `srdi` instruction is used to unroll the loop by a factor of 8, but it does not properly handle the case where the loop counter is not a multiple of 8. This can lead to data corruption and incorrect results. The code assumes that the loop counter is always a multiple of 8, but this is not guaranteed. In the case where the loop counter is not a multiple of 8, the `srdi` instruction will not properly unroll the loop, leading to data corruption and incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to properly handle the case where the loop counter is not a multiple
