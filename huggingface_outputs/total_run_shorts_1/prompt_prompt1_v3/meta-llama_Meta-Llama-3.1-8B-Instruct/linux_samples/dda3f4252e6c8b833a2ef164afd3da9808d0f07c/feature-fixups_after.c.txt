VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `i` variable is used as an index to access the `instrs` array, but it is not checked for bounds. If the `types` parameter is set to `L1D_FLUSH_ORI` and `L1D_FLUSH_MTTRIG`, the `i` variable will exceed the bounds of the `instrs` array, causing a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a variable `i` to keep track of the current index in the `instrs` array. However, the `i` variable is not checked for bounds before it is used to access the `instrs` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `types` parameter is set to a combination of `L1D_FLUSH_ORI` and `L1D_FLUSH_MTTRIG`, which will cause the `i` variable to exceed the bounds of the `instrs` array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the bounds of the `i` variable before using it to access the `instrs` array. This can
