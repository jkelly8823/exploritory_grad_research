VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition when setting the rfi_flush variable. The rfi_flush variable is set to the value of the enable variable without any synchronization. This can lead to a situation where the rfi_flush variable is set to a value that is not consistent with the actual state of the system.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises in the init_fallback_flush function where the rfi_flush variable is set to the value of the enable variable. However, the enable variable is not protected by any synchronization mechanism, which means that it can be modified concurrently by multiple threads. This can lead to a situation where the rfi_flush variable is set to a value that is not consistent with the actual state of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the rfi_flush variable should be protected by a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a spinlock, to ensure that it is set consistently. Additionally, the enable variable should be protected by a synchronization mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications. The corrected code should look like this: 
```c
static void __ref init_fallback_flush(void)
