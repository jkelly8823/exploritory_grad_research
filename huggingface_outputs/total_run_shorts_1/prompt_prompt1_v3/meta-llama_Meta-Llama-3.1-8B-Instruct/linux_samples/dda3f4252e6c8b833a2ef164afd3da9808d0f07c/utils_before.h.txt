VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `fd` parameter in the `perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset` functions.
EXPLANATION: The `perf_event_disable` and `perf_event_reset` functions take an `int` parameter `fd`, which is used as an index to access system resources. However, there is no bounds checking on this parameter, making it possible for an attacker to pass a large value for `fd` and potentially overflow the buffer used to store the system resource index. This could lead to a buffer overflow attack, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include bounds checking on the `fd` parameter. This can be done by adding a simple check to ensure that `fd` is within a valid range (e.g., 0 to some maximum value). Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the `fd` parameter is not used in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow attack. The `unistd.h` and `sys/syscall.h` headers
