VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the `data` pointer.
EXPLANATION: The `tipc_mon_rcv` function is called with the `data` pointer, which is not checked for validity. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the `data` pointer points to an invalid location.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the `data` pointer before passing it to the `tipc_mon_rcv` function. This can be done by checking if the `data` pointer is within the valid range of the buffer. For example: `if (data >= buf_msg(skb) && data <= buf_msg(skb) + dlen) {... }`. Additionally, consider using a safer function that does not require manual bounds checking. .
