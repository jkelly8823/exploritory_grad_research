 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a C implementation of the IPv6 RPL (Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks) protocol. The functions declared here are related to RPL header compression and decompression. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues. However, it is worth noting that the functions declared here are not implemented, and their behavior is not defined. This could potentially lead to issues if the functions are called without proper implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Implement the `ipv6_rpl_srh_size` function to return the correct size of the SRH header.
2. Implement the `ipv6_rpl_srh_decompress` function to decompress the SRH header correctly.
3. Ensure that the `rpl_exit` function is properly implemented to handle any necessary cleanup or termination of the RPL protocol. 4. Consider adding error handling and input validation to the functions to prevent potential security issues. 5. Review the code to ensure that
