VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a double free vulnerability. The `kfree` function is called twice on the same memory block, `interp_elf_ex`, and `interp_elf_phdata`. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the duplicate `kfree` calls for `interp_elf_ex` and `interp_elf_phdata`. The corrected code should only call `kfree` once for each memory block. For example: `kfree(interp_elf_ex); kfree(interp_elf_phdata);` should be replaced with `kfree(interp_elf_ex);` and `kfree(interp_elf_phdata);` should be removed.  Additionally, the `out_free_file` label should be removed as it is no longer necessary. The corrected code should be: `allow_write_access(interpreter); fput(interpreter); kfree(elf_phdata);`  This will prevent the double free vulnerability and ensure the code is safe.  The corrected code should be
