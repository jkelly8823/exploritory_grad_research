 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 8, 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a double free vulnerability. The lines `7, 8, 9, 10` attempt to free the same memory locations twice. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the duplicate free calls on lines 7, 8, 9, 10. The corrected code should only free each memory location once. For example, the corrected code should be: `7, 8, 9, 10` should be removed and only `out_free_file` and `out_free_ph` should be executed.  ```
