VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The function do_close_execat() is called from the function free_bprm() which is called from the function open_exec(). The function do_close_execat() allows write access to the file and then immediately fput()s the file. However, the function free_bprm() also allows write access to the file before it is fput()ed. This creates a race condition where the file can be accessed and modified after it has been closed.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the function do_close_execat() is called from the function free_bprm() which is called from the function open_exec(). The function do_close_execat() is responsible for closing the file and allowing write access to it. However, the function free_bprm() also allows write access to the file before it is closed. This creates a race condition where the file can be accessed and modified after it has been closed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the function free_bprm() should not allow write access to the file until after it has been closed. This can be achieved by moving the call to allow_write_access
