 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17, 23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The function deny_write_access() is called without proper synchronization, which can lead to a race condition when multiple threads try to access the same file.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains multiple instances of the function deny_write_access() being called without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition when multiple threads try to access the same file. The function deny_write_access() is used to deny write access to a file, but it is not thread-safe. This can cause issues when multiple threads try to access the same file simultaneously.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a lock to synchronize access to the file. This can be achieved by using a mutex or a spinlock to protect the critical section of code that calls deny_write_access(). Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all instances of deny_write_access() are properly synchronized. 

Note: The lines mentioned in VULNERABLE_LINES are the lines where the function deny_write_access() is called without proper synchronization.
