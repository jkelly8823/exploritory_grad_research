VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function may_follow_link is declared but not defined. This is a vulnerability because it can lead to undefined behavior when called.
EXPLANATION: The function may_follow_link is declared but not defined. This is a problem because it can lead to undefined behavior when called. The function is declared with a return type of int, but it does not have a body. This means that when the function is called, it will not execute any code and will not return a value. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function may_follow_link should be defined with a body that implements the necessary logic. The function should be implemented to check for unsafe situations and return an appropriate error code. The function should also be implemented to handle any necessary cleanup or error handling. The function should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.
