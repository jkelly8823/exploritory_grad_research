VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of sizeof(int) as the maxlen value, which can be larger than the actual size of the suid_dumpable string.
EXPLANATION: The maxlen value is used to determine the maximum length of the string that can be stored in the data field. However, sizeof(int) is used as the maxlen value, which can be larger than the actual size of the suid_dumpable string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the suid_dumpable string is longer than the maxlen value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a fixed maxlen value that is smaller than or equal to the actual size of the suid_dumpable string, or use a maxlen value that is dynamically calculated based on the actual size of the string. For example, use strlen(suid_dumpable) as the maxlen value. Alternatively, use a safer data type such as a fixed-size array or a dynamically allocated buffer to store the string.  The maxlen value should be set to the size of the suid_dumpable string, which is 13.  The correct code should be: .maxlen		= 13
