VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to hardlink-based time-of-check-time-of-use race and symlink-based time-of-check-time-of-use race.
EXPLANATION: The code does not implement sufficient protections against hardlink-based and symlink-based time-of-check-time-of-use races, which can be exploited in world-writable directories.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement the "protected_hardlinks" and "protected_symlinks" protections to prevent these types of attacks. This can be achieved by setting the corresponding flags to "1" or "2" in the code. Additionally, ensure that world-writable directories are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.  ```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function to check for vulnerabilities
check_vulnerabilities() {
  # Check for protected_fifos vulnerability
  if [ "$protected_fifos" = "0" ]; then
