VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the endptr - ptr expression to calculate the length of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The expression endptr - ptr is used to calculate the length of the buffer, but this expression does not account for the possibility of a null character in the buffer. If the buffer contains a null character, the length calculation will be incorrect, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the strlen() function to calculate the length of the buffer, and check for null characters before using the buffer. For example: size_t len = strlen(ptr); if (len == 0) { /* handle null buffer */ } else { /* use buffer */ } Alternatively, use a safer function like strnlen() to calculate the length of the buffer. ```c
size_t len = strnlen(ptr, endptr - ptr); if (len == 0) { /* handle null buffer */ } else { /* use buffer */ }
``` ```c
