VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the endptr - ptr expression without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The expression endptr - ptr is used to calculate the length of the buffer. However, this expression does not account for the possibility of the buffer being larger than the allocated memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include bounds checking for the buffer length. This can be done by using the strlen() function to get the length of the buffer and then comparing it with the allocated memory size. If the buffer length exceeds the allocated memory size, an error should be returned. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a safer way to calculate the buffer length, such as using the offsetof() macro to get the offset of the end of the buffer.
