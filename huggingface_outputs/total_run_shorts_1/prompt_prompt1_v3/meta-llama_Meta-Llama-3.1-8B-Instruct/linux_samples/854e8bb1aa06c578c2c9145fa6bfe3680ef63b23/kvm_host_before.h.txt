VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a virtualization system, specifically dealing with the handling of exceptions and the definition of constants related to the Task State Segment (TSS). The code snippet is well-structured and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The use of macros for defining constants is a good practice, as it allows for easy modification of these values if needed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet is clean and does not require any changes. However, it would be beneficial to consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each macro and the reasoning behind the chosen values. This would improve the code's maintainability and readability.  ```bash
