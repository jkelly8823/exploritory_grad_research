 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a temporary file vulnerability. The temporary file is created with a predictable name, which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The code uses mkstemp to create a temporary file with a predictable name. This allows an attacker to guess the name of the temporary file and overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This is a classic example of a temporary file vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to create the temporary file, such as using mkstemp with a random suffix or using a library that provides a secure way to create temporary files. Additionally, the code should check the permissions of the temporary file to ensure that it is not writable by other users. ```c
char *temp_file = mkstemp("/tmp/perf-XXXXXX");
if (temp_file == NULL) {
    pr_debug("Can't make temp file");
    free(tdata);
    return NULL;
}
``` ```c
char *temp_file = mkstemp("/tmp/perf-XXXXXX");
if (temp_file == NULL) {
