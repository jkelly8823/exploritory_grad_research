VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The crypto_alloc_rng and crypto_alloc_skcipher functions return a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block, which is then stored in the big_key_rng and big_key_skcipher variables. However, if the allocation fails, the variables are set to NULL, but the code does not check for this condition before using the variables. This can lead to a use-after-free bug, where the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug because it does not properly handle the case where the allocation of memory fails. When the allocation fails, the variables big_key_rng and big_key_skcipher are set to NULL, but the code does not check for this condition before using the variables. This can lead to a use-after-free bug, where the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
