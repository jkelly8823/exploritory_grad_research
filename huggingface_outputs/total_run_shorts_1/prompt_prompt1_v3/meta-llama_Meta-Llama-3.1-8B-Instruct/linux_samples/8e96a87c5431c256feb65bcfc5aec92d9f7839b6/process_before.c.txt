VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the pointer regs without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The line current->thread.regs = regs - 1; is attempting to assign a value to regs without checking if it is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if regs is pointing to an array that is not large enough to hold the value of regs - 1.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add bounds checking to ensure that regs is within the valid range of the array before attempting to assign a value to it. This can be done by checking if regs is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the size of the array. For example: if (regs >= 0 && regs < sizeof(regs->gpr) / sizeof(regs->gpr[0])) { current->thread.regs = regs - 1; } else { /* handle error */ } .
