VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking when copying data into bss_entry->ssid.ssid and bss_entry->data_rates.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the current_ptr into the bss_entry structures without checking the bounds of the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the element_len is larger than the size of the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that element_len is not larger than the size of the destination buffer. Use the following code as a reference: if (element_len <= sizeof(bss_entry->ssid.ssid)) { memcpy(bss_entry->ssid.ssid, (current_ptr + 2), element_len); } else { /* handle error */ } Similarly, add bounds checking for bss_entry->data_rates. Also, consider using safer functions like strlcpy or strncpy to avoid buffer overflows.  ```c
