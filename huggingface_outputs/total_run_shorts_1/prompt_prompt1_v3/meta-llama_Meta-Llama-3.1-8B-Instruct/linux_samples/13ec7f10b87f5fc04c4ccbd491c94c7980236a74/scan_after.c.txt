VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the current_ptr to the bss_entry->data_rates and bss_entry->supported_rates arrays. However, the size of the data to be copied is not checked against the size of the destination arrays, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the arrays.
EXPLANATION: The code assumes that the element_len is the correct size of the data to be copied, but it does not check if the data is larger than the destination arrays. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the element_len is less than or equal to the size of the destination arrays before copying the data. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check the size of the arrays before the memcpy function. For example: if (element_len <= MWIFIEX_SUPPORTED_RATES) { memcpy(bss_entry->data_rates, current_ptr + 2, element_len); memcpy(bss_entry->supported_rates, current
