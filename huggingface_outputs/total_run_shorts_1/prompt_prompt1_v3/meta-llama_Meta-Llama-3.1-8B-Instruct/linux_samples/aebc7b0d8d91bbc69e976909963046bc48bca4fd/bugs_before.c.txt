VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential information disclosure vulnerability due to the use of pr_err() function which can be used to leak sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The pr_err() function is used to print error messages to the kernel log. However, in this code snippet, it is used to print sensitive information such as the expected configuration of CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST. This can potentially lead to information disclosure if an attacker has access to the kernel log. Additionally, the use of pr_err() in the else block can also lead to information disclosure if the condition is not met.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the pr_err() function should be replaced with a more secure function that does not leak sensitive information. For example, the pr_info() function can be used to print information messages to the kernel log without leaking sensitive information. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that sensitive information is not being printed to the kernel log. Additionally, the use of pr_err() in the else block should be removed or replaced with a more secure function.  ```bash
pr_info("list_add() corruption not detected!\n");
pr_info("list_del() corruption not detected
