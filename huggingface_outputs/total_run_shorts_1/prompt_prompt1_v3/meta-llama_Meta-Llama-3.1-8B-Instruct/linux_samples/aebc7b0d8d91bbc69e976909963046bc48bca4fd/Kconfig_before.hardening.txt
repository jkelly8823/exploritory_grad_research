 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a configuration option for a compiler, specifically enabling or disabling the use of Randstruct, a feature added in Clang 15. The comment mentions a known issue (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60349) that prevents safe use of Randstruct until Clang 16. However, this is not a vulnerability in the code itself, but rather a limitation of the feature.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet is safe as written. However, if the goal is to use Randstruct safely, it is recommended to wait until Clang 16 or later is used. If Randstruct is used with Clang 15, the issue mentioned in the comment may cause problems.  The code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
