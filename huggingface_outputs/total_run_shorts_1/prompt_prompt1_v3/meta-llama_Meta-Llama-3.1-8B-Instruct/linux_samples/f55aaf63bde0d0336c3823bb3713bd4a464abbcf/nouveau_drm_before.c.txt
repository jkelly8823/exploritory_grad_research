VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The function nouveau_drm_device_fini is called, which frees the memory allocated for the drm device. However, the function nouveau_cli_fini is called after the memory has been freed, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This is because nouveau_cli_fini is called on the drm device, which has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function nouveau_cli_fini should be called before the memory is freed in the nouveau_drm_device_fini function. This can be achieved by moving the call to nouveau_cli_fini before the call to nouveau_ttm_fini. Additionally, the function nouveau_cli_fini should be called on the correct drm device, not the fpriv device. The correct call should be nouveau_cli_fini(&drm->client);. The function nouveau_cli_fini should also be called on the master device, not the fpriv device. The correct call should be nouveau_cli_fini(&drm->master);. The mutex_destroy should also be called before the memory is freed. The correct call should be
