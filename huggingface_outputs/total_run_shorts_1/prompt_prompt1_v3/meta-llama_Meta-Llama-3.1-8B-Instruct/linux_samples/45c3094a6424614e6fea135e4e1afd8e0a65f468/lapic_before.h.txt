VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow bug. The line `ldr >>= 32 - map->ldr_bits;` can cause an integer overflow when `ldr` is a large number and `map->ldr_bits` is a small number, resulting in a negative value being assigned to `ldr`. This can lead to incorrect results in the subsequent calculation of `cid`.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the right shift operator `>>=` can produce a negative result when the left operand is a large number and the right operand is a small number. In this case, `ldr` is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and `32 - map->ldr_bits` can be a small number. If `ldr` is a large number, the result of the right shift operation can be negative, causing an integer overflow. This can lead to incorrect results in the subsequent calculation of `cid`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `ldr` is not too large before performing the right shift operation. We can also consider using a safer method to extract the bits from `ldr`, such as
