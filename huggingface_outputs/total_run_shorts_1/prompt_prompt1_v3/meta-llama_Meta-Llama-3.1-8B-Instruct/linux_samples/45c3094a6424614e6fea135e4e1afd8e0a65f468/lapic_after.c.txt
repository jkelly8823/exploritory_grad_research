VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the cid variable.
EXPLANATION: The cid variable is assigned the value of apic_cluster_id(map, mda) without any validation. If the value of cid exceeds the size of the map->logical_map array, it will result in an out-of-bounds access. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the cid variable does not exceed the size of the map->logical_map array. This can be done by checking if cid is within the valid range before accessing the array. For example: if (cid >= 0 && cid < ARRAY_SIZE(map->logical_map)) {... } else {... }. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to avoid fixed-size buffer overflows.  ```c
if (cid >= 0 && cid < ARRAY_SIZE(map->logical_map)) {
    dst = map->logical_map[cid];
} else {
    // Handle out-of-bounds error
}
``` ```c
