VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The variable `ret_size` is assigned the value of `size` without checking if `size` is valid. This could lead to a situation where `ret_size` is used after the memory it points to has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The variable `ret_size` is initially assigned the value of `atomic_read(&chip->data_pending)`, which is a valid operation. However, it is then reassigned the value of `size` without any checks. This could lead to a situation where `ret_size` is used after the memory it points to has been freed, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if `size` is valid before assigning it to `ret_size`. This can be done by checking if `size` is within the valid range of values for `ret_size`. Additionally, the code should ensure that `size` is not reassigned to a value that is outside of the valid range of values for `ret_size`. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that `size` is
