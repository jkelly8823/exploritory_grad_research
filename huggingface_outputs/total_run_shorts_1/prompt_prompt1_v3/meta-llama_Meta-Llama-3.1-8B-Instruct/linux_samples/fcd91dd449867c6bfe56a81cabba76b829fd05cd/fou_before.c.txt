VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a double free vulnerability. The first call to `rcu_read_unlock()` is not protected by a conditional statement, and the second call to `rcu_read_unlock()` is not necessary because the first call has already unlocked the RCU read lock. This can lead to a double free error when the `rcu_read_unlock()` function is called twice on the same lock.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the second call to `rcu_read_unlock()` to prevent the double free vulnerability. The corrected code should look like this: 
```c
	if (!ops ||!ops->callbacks.gro_receive)
		goto out_unlock;

	pp = ops->callbacks.gro_receive(head, skb);

out_unlock:
	rcu_read_unlock();
``` 
```c
if (!ops ||!ops->callbacks.gro_receive)
	goto out_unlock;

pp = ops->callbacks.gro_receive(head, skb);

out_unlock:
	rcu_read_unlock();

if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!ops ||!ops->callbacks.gro_receive))
	goto out_unlock;

pp = ops->callbacks.gro_receive(head,
