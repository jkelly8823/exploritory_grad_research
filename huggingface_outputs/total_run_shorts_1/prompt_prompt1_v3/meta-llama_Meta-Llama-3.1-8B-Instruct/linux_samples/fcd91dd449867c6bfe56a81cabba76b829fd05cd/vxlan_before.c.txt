VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The variable'skb' is being used after it has been freed in the 'out' label.
EXPLANATION: The 'out' label is reached when the 'pp' variable is null. However, the'skb_gro_remcsum_cleanup' function is still called on'skb' after this point. This could result in a use-after-free error if'skb' has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Ensure that'skb' is not used after it has been freed. This can be achieved by moving the'skb_gro_remcsum_cleanup' function call to before the 'out' label. Alternatively, add a check to ensure that'skb' is not null before calling'skb_gro_remcsum_cleanup'.
