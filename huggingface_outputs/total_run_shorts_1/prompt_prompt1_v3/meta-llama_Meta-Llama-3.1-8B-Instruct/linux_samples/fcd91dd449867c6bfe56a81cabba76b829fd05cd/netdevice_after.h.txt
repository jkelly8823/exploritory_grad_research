VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the recursion_counter variable.
EXPLANATION: The gro_recursion_inc_test function increments the recursion_counter variable without checking if it has reached the maximum limit of 15. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer by repeatedly calling the gro_recursion_inc_test function, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the gro_recursion_inc_test function to ensure that the recursion_counter variable does not exceed the maximum limit of 15. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the recursion_counter variable is equal to GRO_RECURSION_LIMIT before incrementing it. For example: if (NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->recursion_counter < GRO_RECURSION_LIMIT) { return ++NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->recursion_counter == GRO_RECURSION_LIMIT; } else { return 0; } This will prevent the buffer overflow attack by ensuring that the recursion_counter variable does not exceed the maximum limit. Additionally, consider using a safer data
