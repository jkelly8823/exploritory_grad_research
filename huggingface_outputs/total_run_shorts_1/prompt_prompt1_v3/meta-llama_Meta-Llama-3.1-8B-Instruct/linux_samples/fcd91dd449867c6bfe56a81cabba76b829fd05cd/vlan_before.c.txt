VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists due to the lack of a null check on the skb pointer after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The skb_gro_pull function may free the skb pointer if it is too small to hold the new data. However, the subsequent skb_gro_postpull_rcsum function still attempts to access the skb pointer without checking if it has been freed. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the skb pointer is accessed after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check on the skb pointer after the skb_gro_pull function to ensure it has not been freed before accessing it. The corrected code should look like this: if (skb) { skb_gro_postpull_rcsum(skb, vhdr, sizeof(*vhdr)); } else { /* handle the case where skb is null */ } .
