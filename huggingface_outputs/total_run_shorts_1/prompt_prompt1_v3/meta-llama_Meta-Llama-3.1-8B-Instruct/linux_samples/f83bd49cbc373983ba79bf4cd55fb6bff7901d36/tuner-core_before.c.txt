VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `fe_tuner_ops` pointer is not checked for null before it is dereferenced. If `fe_tuner_ops` is null, then the program will crash when it attempts to call the `get_status` function.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided checks if `fe_tuner_ops` is not null before calling the `get_status` function. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a null pointer dereference. The reason is that the check is performed before the function call, but the function call is still executed if the check passes. If `fe_tuner_ops` is null, then the function call will still be executed, resulting in a null pointer dereference. To prevent this vulnerability, the function call should be guarded by a null check.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if `fe_tuner_ops` is null before calling the `get_status` function. This can be done by adding a null check before the function call
