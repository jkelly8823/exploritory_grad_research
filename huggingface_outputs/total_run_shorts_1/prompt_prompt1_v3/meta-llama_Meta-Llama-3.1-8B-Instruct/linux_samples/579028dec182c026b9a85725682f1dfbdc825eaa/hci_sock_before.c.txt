VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The read_lock is held while iterating over the list of sockets, but the bh_lock_sock_nested call is not protected by the lock. This means that another thread could potentially acquire the lock on the socket while the current thread is still iterating over the list, leading to a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the bh_lock_sock_nested call is not protected by the read_lock. This means that another thread could potentially acquire the lock on the socket while the current thread is still iterating over the list. This could lead to a situation where the current thread is trying to access the socket while it is still locked by another thread, resulting in a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the bh_lock_sock_nested call should be protected by the read_lock. This can be done by moving the read_lock call to before the bh_lock_sock_nested call, like so: read_lock(&hci_sk_list.lock); bh_lock_sock_nested(sk);... bh_unlock_sock(sk); read_unlock(&hci_sk_list.lock); This will ensure that the lock on the socket is always held while the
