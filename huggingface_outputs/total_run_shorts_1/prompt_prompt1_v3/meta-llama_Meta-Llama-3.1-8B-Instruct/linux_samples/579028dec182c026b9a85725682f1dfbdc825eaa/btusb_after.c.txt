VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential firmware loading issue due to the repeated calls to firmware_request_nowarn() with the same fwname. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the firmware loading fails.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances of firmware_request_nowarn() being called with the same fwname. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the firmware loading fails. The firmware_request_nowarn() function is used to request firmware from the device, but it does not handle the case where the firmware loading fails. If the firmware loading fails, the function will return an error, but the code does not properly handle this error. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle the error returned by firmware_request_nowarn(). This can be done by checking the return value of firmware_request_nowarn() and handling the error accordingly. Additionally, the code should be modified to avoid repeated calls to firmware_request_nowarn() with the same fwname. This can be done by storing the result of firmware_request_nowarn() in a variable and re
