VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file defining constants for CPU capabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet defines a series of constants for CPU capabilities, which are likely used to determine the capabilities of the CPU at runtime. The constants are defined using the #define directive, which is a preprocessor directive that defines a macro. The macros are then used to define the capabilities of the CPU. The code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a well-structured and safe header file. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and up-to-date. Additionally, it is a good practice to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code. In this case, the naming convention is consistent, but it may be worth considering using a more descriptive name for the constants, such as ARM64_CPU_CAPABILITY_ instead of ARM64_*.  This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.  However, this is not a vulnerability and is just a suggestion.  The code is safe.  The
