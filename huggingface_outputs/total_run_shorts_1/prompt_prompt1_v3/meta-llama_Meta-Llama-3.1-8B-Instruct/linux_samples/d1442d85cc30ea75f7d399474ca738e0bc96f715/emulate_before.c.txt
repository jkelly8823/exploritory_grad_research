VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function __load_segment_descriptor does not check if the selector is valid before loading the segment descriptor. This can lead to a segmentation fault if an invalid selector is passed.
EXPLANATION: The function __load_segment_descriptor takes a selector as an argument and loads the corresponding segment descriptor. However, it does not check if the selector is valid before loading the descriptor. This can lead to a segmentation fault if an invalid selector is passed. The function should check if the selector is valid before loading the descriptor.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function __load_segment_descriptor should be modified to check if the selector is valid before loading the descriptor. This can be done by checking if the selector is within the valid range of selectors (0-0xFFFF) and if the selector is not a reserved selector. If the selector is invalid, the function should return an error code indicating that the selector is invalid.
