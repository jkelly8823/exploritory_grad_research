 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the stack frame size.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD` constant to calculate the stack frame size, but it does not check if the calculated size exceeds the maximum allowed stack size. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if an attacker can manipulate the stack frame size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking on the stack frame size to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed stack size. This can be done by using a function that checks the stack size before allocating memory. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer method to calculate the stack frame size, such as using a fixed-size stack frame.
