 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the read_lock_irqsave() and write_lock_irqsave() calls in xen_free_irq() and xen_irq_lateeoi() functions. This is because the read_lock_irqsave() call is not sufficient to protect against concurrent modifications to the irq_info structure.
EXPLANATION: The read_lock_irqsave() call in xen_free_irq() and xen_irq_lateeoi() functions only protects against concurrent reads of the irq_info structure, but not against concurrent writes. This is because the read_lock_irqsave() call is not sufficient to protect against concurrent modifications to the irq_info structure. The write_lock_irqsave() call in xen_free_irq() function is used to protect against concurrent modifications to the irq_info structure, but it is not sufficient to protect against concurrent reads. This creates a race condition between the read_lock_irqsave() and write_lock_irqsave() calls.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the read_lock_irqsave() call in xen_free_irq() and xen_irq_lateeoi() functions should be replaced with a write_lock_irqsave() call to protect against concurrent modifications to the irq_info structure. Additionally, the
