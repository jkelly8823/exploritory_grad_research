VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly check for the existence of the session keyring before attempting to join it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the keyring does not exist.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to join a session keyring using the `join_session_keyring` function. However, it does not check if the keyring exists before attempting to join it. If the keyring does not exist, the `join_session_keyring` function will return an error, but the code does not handle this error properly. Instead, it attempts to free the `name` pointer, which is a null pointer in this case, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `join_session_keyring` before attempting to free the `name` pointer. If the return value is an error, the code should handle the error properly and not attempt to free the null pointer. Additionally, the code should check if the keyring exists before attempting to join it. This can be done by using the `keyctl_search` function to search for the keyring before
