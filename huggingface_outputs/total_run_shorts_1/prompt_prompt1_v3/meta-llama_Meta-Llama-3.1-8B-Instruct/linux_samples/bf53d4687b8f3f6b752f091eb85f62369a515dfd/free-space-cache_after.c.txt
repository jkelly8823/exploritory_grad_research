VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The variable right_info is used after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The variable right_info is freed when the function returns, but it is still used in the if statement. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable right_info should be freed before it is used again. This can be achieved by moving the if statement above the line where right_info is freed. Alternatively, the variable right_info can be reassigned to a new pointer before it is used again. However, this would require additional checks to ensure that the new pointer is valid. The best solution would be to avoid using the variable right_info after it has been freed. This can be achieved by reorganizing the code to avoid the use-after-free vulnerability. For example, the if statement can be moved above the line where right_info is freed, or the variable right_info can be reassigned to a new pointer before it is used again. It is also worth noting that the use of the variable right_info after it has been freed is likely a bug and should be fixed. The code should
