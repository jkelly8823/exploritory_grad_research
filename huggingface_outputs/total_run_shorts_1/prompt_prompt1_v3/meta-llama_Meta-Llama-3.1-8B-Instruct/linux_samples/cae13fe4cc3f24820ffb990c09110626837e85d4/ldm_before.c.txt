VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a race condition. The function returns false as soon as it finds a duplicate VBLK, but it does not prevent other threads from accessing the list while it is still iterating over it. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the function is not thread-safe. It checks for duplicate VBLKs, but it does not prevent other threads from accessing the list while it is still iterating over it. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The function returns false as soon as it finds a duplicate VBLK, but it does not prevent other threads from accessing the list while it is still iterating over it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the function should be made thread-safe. This can be done by using a lock to prevent other threads from accessing the list while it is iterating over it. One way to do this is to use a mutex to lock the list while it is being iterated over. The function should also be modified to check for duplicate VBLKs in a thread-safe manner. This can be done by using a lock to prevent other
