VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the rec variable.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if the rec variable is within the valid range of the f->num variable before using it as an index. This allows an attacker to potentially access memory outside the bounds of the f->map array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the rec variable is within the valid range of the f->num variable before using it as an index. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if rec is less than f->num before using it. For example: if (rec < f->num) {... } else {... }. This will prevent the buffer overflow attack. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or a set, to store the map data to avoid the use of arrays and potential buffer overflows.  ```c
if (rec >= f->num) {
	ldm_error("REC value (%d) exceeds NUM value (%d)", rec, f->num);
	return false;
}
```
