VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of memset with a fixed size (EXT4_MIN_INLINE_DATA_SIZE) without checking the actual size of the buffer being cleared.
EXPLANATION: The memset function is used to clear the contents of two buffers: ext4_raw_inode(&is.iloc)->i_block and ei->i_data. However, the size of these buffers is not checked before clearing them. If the size of the buffer is larger than EXT4_MIN_INLINE_DATA_SIZE, the memset function will only clear a portion of the buffer, leaving the remaining portion unchanged. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the remaining portion of the buffer is used later in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the actual size of the buffer before clearing it with memset. This can be done by using the sizeof operator to get the size of the buffer and then passing that size to memset. For example: memset((void *)ext4_raw_inode(&is.iloc)->i_block, 0, sizeof(ext4_raw_inode(&is.iloc)->i_block));. The same fix should be applied to the ei->i
