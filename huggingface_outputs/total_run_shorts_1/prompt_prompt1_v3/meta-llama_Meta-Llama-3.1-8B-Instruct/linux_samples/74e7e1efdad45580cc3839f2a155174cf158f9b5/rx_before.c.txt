 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The spin_lock_irqsave() function is used to protect the critical section of code, but the netif_tx_stop_queue() function is not protected by the lock. This allows for the possibility of a concurrent call to netif_tx_stop_queue() while the lock is held, resulting in a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The spin_lock_irqsave() function is used to protect the critical section of code, but the netif_tx_stop_queue() function is not protected by the lock. This allows for the possibility of a concurrent call to netif_tx_stop_queue() while the lock is held, resulting in a race condition. This can be seen in the following lines of code: if (queue->rx_queue_len >= queue->rx_queue_max) {... netif_tx_stop_queue(netdev_get_tx_queue(dev, queue->id));... } This is a problem because the netif_tx_stop_queue() function can be called concurrently while the lock is held, resulting in a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the netif_tx_stop_queue() function should be protected by the
