VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the do_cpuid_func function. The function does not properly validate the input parameter 'func' before passing it to the __do_cpuid_func function. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if 'func' is a large value.
EXPLANATION: The do_cpuid_func function takes an input parameter 'func' which is a 32-bit unsigned integer. However, the function does not check if 'func' is within the valid range before passing it to the __do_cpuid_func function. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if 'func' is a large value. The __do_cpuid_func function may not be designed to handle large values of 'func', which could result in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The do_cpuid_func function should be modified to validate the input parameter 'func' before passing it to the __do_cpuid_func function. This can be done by checking if 'func' is within the valid range before calling the __do_cpuid_func function. Additionally, the __do_cpuid_func function should be reviewed to ensure it can handle large values of '
