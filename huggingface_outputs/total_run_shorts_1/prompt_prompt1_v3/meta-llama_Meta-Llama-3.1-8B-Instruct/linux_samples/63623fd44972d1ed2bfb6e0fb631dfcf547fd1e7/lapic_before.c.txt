VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential null pointer dereference
EXPLANATION: The function pv_eoi_set_pending() does not check if the pointer apic is null before dereferencing it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if apic is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check for the apic pointer before dereferencing it. For example: if (apic!= NULL) {... } else {... } to handle the case where apic is null.
