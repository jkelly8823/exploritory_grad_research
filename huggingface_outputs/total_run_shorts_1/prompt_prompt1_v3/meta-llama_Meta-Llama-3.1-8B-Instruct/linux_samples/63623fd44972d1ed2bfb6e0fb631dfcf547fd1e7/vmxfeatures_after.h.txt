 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet appears to be a header file defining constants for VMX features.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a series of constants for VMX features using the #define directive. The constants are defined as bitmasks, with each feature represented by a unique value. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The use of #define directives to define constants is a common and safe practice in C programming.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be a safe and well-structured header file. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues, especially when working with sensitive or critical systems. Additionally, consider using a consistent naming convention and formatting style throughout the codebase.  ```bash
