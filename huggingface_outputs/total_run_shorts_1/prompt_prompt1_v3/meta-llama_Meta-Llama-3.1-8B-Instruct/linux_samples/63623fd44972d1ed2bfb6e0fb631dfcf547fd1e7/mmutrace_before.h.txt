VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the __entry->gfn assignment.
EXPLANATION: The TP_fast_assign macro is used to assign values to the __entry structure. However, the assignment of __entry->gfn does not check if the value of gfn exceeds the maximum allowed value for a gfn. This can lead to a buffer overflow if gfn is larger than the maximum allowed value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that gfn does not exceed the maximum allowed value. This can be done by using a function like gfn_valid() to check if gfn is valid before assigning it to __entry->gfn. For example: if (gfn_valid(gfn)) { __entry->gfn = gfn; } else { /* handle invalid gfn */ }.  Additionally, consider using a safer assignment method, such as using a pointer to a buffer and checking the bounds of the buffer before assigning to it.  This will prevent buffer overflows and ensure the integrity of the __entry structure.  It is also recommended to use a secure
