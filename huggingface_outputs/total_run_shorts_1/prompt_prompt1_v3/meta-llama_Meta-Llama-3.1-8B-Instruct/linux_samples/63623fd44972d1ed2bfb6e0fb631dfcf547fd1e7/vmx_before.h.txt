VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the vmcs02 struct.
EXPLANATION: The vmcs02 struct is being used without any bounds checking, which means that if the struct is larger than expected, it could cause a buffer overflow. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the vmcs02 struct to ensure that it does not exceed the expected size. This can be done by using a library function such as strncpy or by manually checking the size of the struct before using it. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a dynamically allocated array to store the vmcs02 struct.  ```c
struct loaded_vmcs *vmcs02 = malloc(sizeof(struct loaded_vmcs));
if (vmcs02 == NULL) {
    // handle memory allocation error
}
``` ```c
size_t vmcs02_size = sizeof(struct loaded_vmcs);
if (vmcs02_size > MAX_VMCS_SIZE) {
    // handle buffer overflow
}
``` ```c
char vmcs02_str[MAX_VMCS_SIZE];
strncpy(vmcs
