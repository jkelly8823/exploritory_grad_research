VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a variable-length macro expansion in the __FOP_FUNC macro.
EXPLANATION: The __FOP_FUNC macro expands to a string that includes a variable-length value (FASTOP_SIZE) which is then used in an assembly instruction. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of FASTOP_SIZE is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the __FOP_FUNC macro should be modified to use a fixed-length value for the alignment directive, or the value of FASTOP_SIZE should be properly sanitized before being used in the assembly instruction. Additionally, the use of variable-length macro expansions should be avoided in favor of fixed-length values or safer alternatives.  The use of a fixed-length value for the alignment directive would be the most straightforward fix. For example, the macro could be modified to use a fixed value such as ".align 16" instead of ".align " __stringify(FASTOP_SIZE) ". The use of a fixed value would prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability.  Alternatively, the value of FASTOP_SIZE could be properly sanitized before being used in the assembly
