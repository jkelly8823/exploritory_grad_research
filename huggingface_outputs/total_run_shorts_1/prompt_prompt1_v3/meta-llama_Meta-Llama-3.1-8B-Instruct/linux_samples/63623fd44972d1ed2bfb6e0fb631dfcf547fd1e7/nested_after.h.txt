VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the get_vmcs12 function.
EXPLANATION: The get_vmcs12 function does not check if the to_vmx(vcpu) pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if to_vmx(vcpu) is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check for the to_vmx(vcpu) pointer before dereferencing it. If the pointer is null, return an error or handle it accordingly. For example: if (to_vmx(vcpu) == NULL) return NULL; or if (to_vmx(vcpu) == NULL) return -EINVAL; or handle it in a way that makes sense for the specific use case.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the nested_cpu_has_mtf function.
EXPLANATION: The nested_cpu_has_mtf function does not check if the vmcs12 pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if vmcs12 is null.
