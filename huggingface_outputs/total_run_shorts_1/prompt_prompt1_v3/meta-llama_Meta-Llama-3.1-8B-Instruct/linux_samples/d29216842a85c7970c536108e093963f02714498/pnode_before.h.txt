 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file, and it does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet consists of function declarations and a macro guard. The function declarations specify the parameters and return types of functions, but they do not contain any executable code. The macro guard is used to prevent multiple inclusions of the header file. There is no code that could potentially lead to a vulnerability such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as this code snippet does not contain any code that could introduce a vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that the function declarations are correct and the macro guard is properly implemented.  Please note that this code snippet is a header file and does not contain any executable code. It is intended to provide function declarations and other definitions that can be used by other parts of the program.  It is not possible to introduce a vulnerability in a header file.  The vulnerability could potentially be introduced in the code that uses these function declarations.  It is the
