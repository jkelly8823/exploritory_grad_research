 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file for the Linux kernel, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet defines two external functions and a constant, but it does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability. The functions and constant are declared, but their implementations are not provided, which is a common practice in header files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be a standard header file and does not require any changes.  Please note that this code snippet is a header file and does not contain any executable code. It is not possible to introduce a vulnerability in a header file. However, if the implementation of the functions and constant in a corresponding source file contains vulnerabilities, they would need to be addressed separately.
