 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The lock_page() function is called after the spin_unlock(vmf->ptl) function. This means that the page may be modified by another thread between the time the lock is released and the time it is reacquired.
EXPLANATION: The spin_unlock(vmf->ptl) function is used to release the lock on the page table lock. However, the lock_page() function is then called to reacquire the lock on the page. This creates a window of opportunity for another thread to modify the page between the time the lock is released and the time it is reacquired. This can lead to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lock_page() function should be called before the spin_unlock(vmf->ptl) function. This will ensure that the lock is held for the entire duration of the critical section, preventing the race condition. The corrected code would be: if (!trylock_page(page)) { get_page(page); lock_page(page); spin_unlock(vmf->ptl); }... (rest of the code remains the same)
