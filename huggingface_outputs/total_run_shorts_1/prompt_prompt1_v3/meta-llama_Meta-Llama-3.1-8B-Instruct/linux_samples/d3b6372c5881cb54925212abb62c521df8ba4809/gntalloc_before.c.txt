VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The __del_gref function is not thread-safe. It is possible for multiple threads to access and modify the gref_list and queue_gref lists simultaneously, leading to data corruption and potential crashes.
EXPLANATION: The __del_gref function is not protected by a lock, and it accesses and modifies the gref_list and queue_gref lists. If multiple threads call __del_gref concurrently, they may interfere with each other's operations, leading to a race condition. This can cause data corruption and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the __del_gref function should be protected by a lock that covers the entire function. This will ensure that only one thread can access and modify the gref_list and queue_gref lists at a time, preventing the race condition. The lock should be acquired at the beginning of the function and released at the end. Additionally, the list_splice_tail function should be called with the lock held, to prevent other threads from accessing the lists while the splice is in progress. The mutex_unlock function should be called after the list_splice
