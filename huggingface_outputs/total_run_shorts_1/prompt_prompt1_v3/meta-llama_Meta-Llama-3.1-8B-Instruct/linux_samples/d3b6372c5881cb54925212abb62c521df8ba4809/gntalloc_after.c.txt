VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `gref` pointer is being used after it has been freed in the `__del_gref` function.
EXPLANATION: The `gref` pointer is being used to access the `page` and `notify` members after it has been freed with `kfree(gref)`. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the `gref` pointer should not be used after it has been freed. The `page` and `notify` members should be accessed before freeing the `gref` pointer. Alternatively, the `gref` pointer can be copied before freeing it, and the copy can be used to access the `page` and `notify` members.
