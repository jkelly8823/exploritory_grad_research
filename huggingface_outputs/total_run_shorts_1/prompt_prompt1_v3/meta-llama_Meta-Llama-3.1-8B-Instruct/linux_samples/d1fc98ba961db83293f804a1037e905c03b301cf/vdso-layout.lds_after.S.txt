VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a linker script, which is used to define the layout of the executable file. It contains various sections, such as.text,.rodata, and.dynamic, which are used to store different types of data. The script also defines some constants and macros, such as SHDR_SIZE and NUM_FAKE_SHDRS. However, upon reviewing the code, no obvious vulnerabilities were found.
