VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of put_user_ex() function without checking the length of the restorer address.
EXPLANATION: The put_user_ex() function is used to copy data from user space to kernel space. However, it does not perform any length checks on the data being copied. In this case, the restorer address is being copied from user space to kernel space without any checks. If the user provides a malicious restorer address that is longer than the buffer size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the restorer address before copying it to kernel space using put_user_ex(). This can be done by checking the size of the restorer address and ensuring it does not exceed the buffer size. Additionally, consider using a safer function like copy_to_user() which performs length checks.  ```c
if (sizeof(restorer) <= sizeof(frame->pretcode)) {
    put_user_ex(restorer, &frame->pretcode);
} else {
    // Handle the error or use a safer
