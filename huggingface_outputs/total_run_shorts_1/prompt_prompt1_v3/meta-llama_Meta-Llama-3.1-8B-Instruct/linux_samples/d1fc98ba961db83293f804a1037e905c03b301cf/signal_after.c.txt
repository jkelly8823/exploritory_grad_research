VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The `restorer` pointer is being used after it has been freed. This is because the `put_user_ex` function is being called with the address of `restorer` after it has been overwritten by the `ksig->ka.sa.sa_restorer` value.
EXPLANATION: The `restorer` pointer is initially set to a valid address in the `current->mm->context.vdso` memory region. However, if the `SA_RESTORER` flag is set in the `ksig->ka.sa.sa_flags` value, the `restorer` pointer is overwritten with the value of `ksig->ka.sa.sa_restorer`. This new value is not necessarily a valid address, and it is being used as the argument to the `put_user_ex` function. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the original `restorer` pointer has been freed or reused.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the `restorer` pointer is not overwritten with an invalid value. This can be achieved by
