 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The kmem_cache_destroy function is called on a pointer that is being freed, which can lead to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The kmem_cache_destroy function is called on the cache pointer stored in the info structure. However, the info structure is being freed in the previous line, which means that the cache pointer is no longer valid. This can lead to undefined behavior when the kmem_cache_destroy function tries to access the freed memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The kmem_cache_destroy function should be called before freeing the info structure. Alternatively, the cache pointer should be stored in a local variable before freeing the info structure, and the kmem_cache_destroy function should be called on the local variable. This will ensure that the cache pointer is not accessed after it has been freed.
