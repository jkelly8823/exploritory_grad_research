VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of an exception handling mechanism for an ARM-based system, specifically for handling FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request) and SVC (Supervisor Call) exceptions. It defines a vector table with handlers for FIQ, SVC, and IRQ (Interrupt Request) exceptions.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is written in ARM assembly language and appears to be part of a larger system. It defines a vector table with handlers for FIQ, SVC, and IRQ exceptions. The handlers are implemented using the SVC stack, which allows FIQ to behave like NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) on x86 systems. The code also includes a data section with a global variable `cr_alignment`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be a standard implementation of an exception handling mechanism for an ARM-based system. However, it is essential to ensure that the handlers are properly implemented and tested to handle various scenarios. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it follows the recommended coding standards and best practices for ARM assembly language programming.  Please note that this code is likely part of a larger system and may require additional context
