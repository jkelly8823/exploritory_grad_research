VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of validation of the size of the fib data.
EXPLANATION: The code does not properly validate the size of the fib data before copying it into a buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the fib data is larger than the buffer size. The code checks if the size of the fib data is less than the sender size, but it does not check if the size of the fib data is larger than the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the fib data is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the size of the fib data is larger than the buffer size before copying it into the buffer. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the size of the fib data is less than or equal to the buffer size. Additionally, the code should validate the size of the fib data before copying it into the buffer to prevent buffer overflows. This can be done by using a function that validates the size of the fib data before copying it into the buffer.  The code should
