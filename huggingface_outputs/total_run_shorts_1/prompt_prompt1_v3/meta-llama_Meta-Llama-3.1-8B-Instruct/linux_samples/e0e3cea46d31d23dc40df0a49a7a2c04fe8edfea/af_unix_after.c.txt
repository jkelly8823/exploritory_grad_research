VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a double-free vulnerability. The line `if (NULL == siocb->scm) siocb->scm = &tmp_scm;` is executed twice, which can lead to a double-free error when the `scm_send` function is called. This is because the `scm` pointer is being reassigned to point to the same memory location, and the `scm_send` function may attempt to free the memory pointed to by `scm` twice.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the duplicate assignment of `siocb->scm` to `&tmp_scm`. The corrected code should look like this: `if (NULL == siocb->scm) siocb->scm = &tmp_scm; wait_for_unix_gc(); err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm, false); if (err < 0) return err; err = -EOPNOTSUPP;` This ensures that the `scm` pointer is only assigned once, preventing
