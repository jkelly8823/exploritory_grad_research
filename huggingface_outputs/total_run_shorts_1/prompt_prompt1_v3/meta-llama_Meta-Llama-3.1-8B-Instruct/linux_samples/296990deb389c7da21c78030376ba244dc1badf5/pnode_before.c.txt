VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite loop in the next_group function.
EXPLANATION: The next_group function contains two nested while loops that will cause an infinite loop. The outer loop will continue to run indefinitely because it has no termination condition. The inner loop will also continue to run indefinitely because it has no termination condition. This will cause the function to consume all available system resources and eventually crash the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the termination condition for the outer loop should be added. The inner loop should also be removed or modified to have a termination condition. The function should be rewritten to avoid the use of infinite loops. For example, the function could use a recursive approach or a loop with a well-defined termination condition. Additionally, the function should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it does not cause any issues in the future.  The function should also be reviewed by a peer to ensure that it is correct and efficient.  The function should also be documented to explain its purpose and how it works.  The function should also be tested with different inputs to ensure that it works correctly in all scenarios.  The function should also be tested with edge cases to ensure
