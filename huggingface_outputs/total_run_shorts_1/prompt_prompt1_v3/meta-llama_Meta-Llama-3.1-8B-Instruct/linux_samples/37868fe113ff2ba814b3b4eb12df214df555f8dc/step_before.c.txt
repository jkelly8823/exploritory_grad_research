 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The mutex lock is acquired, but the check for the bogus selector is performed before the lock is acquired. This means that another thread could potentially access the child->mm->context.lock between the check and the lock acquisition, resulting in a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The mutex lock is acquired on line 7, but the check for the bogus selector is performed on line 5. This means that another thread could potentially access the child->mm->context.lock between the check and the lock acquisition, resulting in a race condition. This is a classic example of a data race, where two threads are accessing the same resource without proper synchronization.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the check for the bogus selector should be performed after the mutex lock is acquired. This can be done by moving the check to after the mutex lock acquisition on line 7. The corrected code would look like this: mutex_lock(&child->mm->context.lock); if (unlikely((seg >> 3) >= child->mm->context.size)) addr = -1L; /* bogus selector, access would fault */ else {
