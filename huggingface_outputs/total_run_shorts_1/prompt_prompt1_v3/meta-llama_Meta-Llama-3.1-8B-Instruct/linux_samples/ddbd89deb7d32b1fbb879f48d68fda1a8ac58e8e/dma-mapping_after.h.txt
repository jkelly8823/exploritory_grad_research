 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of magic numbers in the bit shifting operations. The numbers 9 and 10 are used as shift values without any explanation or documentation, making it difficult to understand the intended behavior and potentially leading to errors or misconfigurations.
EXPLANATION: The use of magic numbers can make the code harder to maintain and understand, especially for developers who are not familiar with the specific requirements of the DMA-mapping subsystem. It is recommended to replace these magic numbers with named constants or enums to improve code readability and reduce the risk of errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the magic numbers 9 and 10 with named constants or enums, and provide documentation to explain the intended behavior of the DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED and DMA_ATTR_OVERWRITE attributes. For example:
```
#define DMA_ATTR_PRIVILEGED		DMA_ATTR_SHIFT_9
#define DMA_ATTR_OVERWRITE		DMA_ATTR_SHIFT_10

enum dma_attr_shift {
	DMA_ATTR_SHIFT_9 = 1UL << 9,
	DMA_ATTR_SHIFT_10 = 1UL << 10,
};
```  VULNERABLE: YES
