VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking on num_mpdu_ranges.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if num_mpdu_ranges is greater than 1, but it does not check if it is within the valid range of the buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if num_mpdu_ranges is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that num_mpdu_ranges is within the valid range of the buffer. For example, you can add a check to ensure that num_mpdu_ranges is less than or equal to the buffer size. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the mpdu ranges.  The check for num_mpdu_ranges > 1 is likely a leftover from a previous version of the code and can be removed.  The check for discard is a good practice and should be kept.  The goto err statement is also a good practice and should be kept.  The ath10k_dbg statement is also a good practice and should be kept.
