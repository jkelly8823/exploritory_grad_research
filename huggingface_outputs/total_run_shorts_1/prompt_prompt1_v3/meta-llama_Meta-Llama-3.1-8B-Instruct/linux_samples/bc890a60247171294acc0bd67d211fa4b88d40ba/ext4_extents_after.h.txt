VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for an EXT4 file system. It defines two constants and a macro function. The macro function, EXT4_EXTENT_TAIL_OFFSET, takes a header as an argument and calculates the offset of the tail of an extent. The code uses standard C macros and does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a standard and safe implementation of EXT4 file system macros.  |
