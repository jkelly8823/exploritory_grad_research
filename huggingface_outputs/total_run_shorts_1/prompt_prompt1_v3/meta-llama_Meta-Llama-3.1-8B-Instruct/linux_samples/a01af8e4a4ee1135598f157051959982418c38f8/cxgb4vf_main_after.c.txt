VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs and collect_netdev_mc_list_addrs functions do not check if the maxaddrs parameter is greater than the size of the addr array, which can lead to a buffer overflow when the function tries to access addr[naddr] when naddr is equal to maxaddrs.
EXPLANATION: The collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs and collect_netdev_mc_list_addrs functions do not check if the maxaddrs parameter is greater than the size of the addr array. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the function tries to access addr[naddr] when naddr is equal to maxaddrs. The function will try to access addr[naddr] which is out of bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs and collect_netdev_mc_list_addrs functions should check if the maxaddrs parameter is greater than the size of the addr array before accessing addr[naddr]. This can be done by adding a check before the line addr[naddr++] = ha->addr; to ensure that naddr is less
