VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs and collect_netdev_mc_list_addrs functions do not check if the maxaddrs parameter is less than or equal to the size of the addr array. This allows an attacker to overflow the addr array and potentially execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs and collect_netdev_mc_list_addrs functions are designed to collect up to maxaddrs worth of a netdevice's unicast and multicast addresses into an array of addr pointers. However, the functions do not check if the maxaddrs parameter is less than or equal to the size of the addr array. This allows an attacker to overflow the addr array by passing a large value for maxaddrs. The addr array is declared with a size of 7, but the functions do not check if maxaddrs is greater than 7. If maxaddrs is greater than 7, the addr array will be overflowed, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the collect_netdev_uc_list_addrs and collect
