 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the x25_asy_close function and the x25_asy_close_tty function. The x25_asy_close function clears the TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP flag, while the x25_asy_close_tty function checks for this flag. If the x25_asy_close function is called after the x25_asy_close_tty function, the flag will be cleared, causing the x25_asy_close_tty function to incorrectly assume that the TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP flag is not set.
EXPLANATION: The x25_asy_close function and the x25_asy_close_tty function are not properly synchronized. The x25_asy_close function clears the TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP flag, while the x25_asy_close_tty function checks for this flag. If the x25_asy_close function is called after the x25_asy_close_tty function, the flag will be cleared, causing the x25_asy_close_tty function to incorrectly assume that the TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP flag is not set. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
