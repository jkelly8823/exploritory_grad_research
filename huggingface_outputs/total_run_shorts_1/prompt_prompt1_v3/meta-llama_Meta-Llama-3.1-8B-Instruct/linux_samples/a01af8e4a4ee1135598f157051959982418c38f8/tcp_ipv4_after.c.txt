VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists due to the lack of null check for the 'cur' variable before accessing it.
EXPLANATION: The 'cur' variable is assigned the value of'sk' without checking if'sk' is null. If'sk' is null, then accessing 'cur' will result in a null pointer dereference. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check for the 'cur' variable before accessing it. For example, you can add the following code before the 'out' label: if (cur == NULL) { /* handle the error */ } else { /* proceed with the code */ } .

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists due to the lack of null check for the 'icsk' variable before accessing it.
EXPLANATION: The 'icsk' variable is assigned the value of 'inet_csk(sk)' without checking if'sk' is null. If'sk' is null, then accessing
