VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The function au1000_hard_stop() is called before the MAC is disabled, which can lead to a situation where the MAC is disabled while it is still being used by the au1000_hard_stop() function.
EXPLANATION: The au1000_hard_stop() function is called before the MAC is disabled, which can lead to a situation where the MAC is disabled while it is still being used by the au1000_hard_stop() function. This can cause a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The au1000_hard_stop() function should be called after the MAC is disabled. The correct order should be: disable the MAC, call au1000_hard_stop(), and then reset the MAC. This can be achieved by moving the call to au1000_hard_stop() after the line "aup->mac_enabled = 0;". Additionally, the use of a spinlock to protect the critical section of code would help prevent this race condition. The spinlock should be acquired before disabling the MAC and released after the MAC has been reset. This can be achieved by adding the following code: spin
