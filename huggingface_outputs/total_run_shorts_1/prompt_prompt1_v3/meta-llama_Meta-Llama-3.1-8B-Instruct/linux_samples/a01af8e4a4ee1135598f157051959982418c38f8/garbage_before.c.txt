VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the wait_for_unix_gc function. The wait_event function is used to wait for the gc_in_progress flag to be false, but this flag is not atomic and can be modified by other threads while the wait is in progress.
EXPLANATION: The wait_event function is a spinlock-based wait function that will continuously poll the condition until it is met. However, in this case, the condition is a non-atomic boolean flag that can be modified by other threads. This means that the wait_event function may see the flag as false, wait for it to become false, and then see it as true again after the wait has completed, resulting in a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the gc_in_progress flag should be made atomic by using a spinlock or a mutex to protect access to it. This will ensure that the flag is not modified while the wait_event function is waiting for it to be false. Alternatively, the wait_event function could be replaced with a waitqueue-based wait function that uses a waitqueue to wait for the condition, which would be more robust and less prone to race conditions.
