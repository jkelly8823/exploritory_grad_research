VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `instrs` array is not checked for its bounds before being used to store and access instructions. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `types` parameter is not properly validated.
EXPLANATION: The `instrs` array is declared with a size of 4, but it is used to store instructions for different types of flushes. The `types` parameter is used to determine which instructions to store in the array. However, the array is not checked for its bounds before being used to store and access instructions. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `types` parameter is not properly validated. For example, if `types` is set to `L1D_FLUSH_ORI | L1D_FLUSH_MTTRIG`, the `instrs` array will be used to store 6 instructions, which is beyond its declared size of 4. This can lead to a buffer overflow
