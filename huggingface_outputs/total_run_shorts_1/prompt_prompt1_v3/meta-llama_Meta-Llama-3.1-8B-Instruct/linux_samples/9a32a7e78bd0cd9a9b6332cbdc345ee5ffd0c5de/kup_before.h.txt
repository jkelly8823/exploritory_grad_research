VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function allow_read_from_user does not check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before reading from it.
EXPLANATION: The function allow_read_from_user takes a pointer to a user-space memory location and a size as arguments. However, it does not check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before reading from it. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the user is not allowed to access the memory location.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function allow_read_from_user should be modified to check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before reading from it. This can be done by calling the function bad_kuap_fault with the current register state and the memory location as arguments, and checking the return value. If the return value is true, the function should return an error. Otherwise, it can proceed with reading from the memory location. The modified function would look something like this: ```c
static inline bool
allow_read_from_user(const void __user *from, unsigned long size)
{
	struct pt_regs *regs = get_regs();
	return!bad_kuap_fault(regs, (unsigned long)from
