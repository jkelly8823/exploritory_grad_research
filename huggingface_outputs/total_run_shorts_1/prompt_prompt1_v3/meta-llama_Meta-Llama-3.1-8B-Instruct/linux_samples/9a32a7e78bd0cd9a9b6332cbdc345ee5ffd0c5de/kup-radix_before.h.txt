VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition in the allow_user_access function. The function sets the KUAP to blocked before checking if the access is allowed, which can lead to a situation where the access is allowed but the KUAP is still blocked.
EXPLANATION: The allow_user_access function first sets the KUAP to blocked, and then checks if the access is allowed. However, this check is done after the KUAP has been set to blocked, which means that even if the access is allowed, the KUAP will still be blocked. This can lead to a situation where the access is allowed but the KUAP is still blocked, which can cause unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The allow_user_access function should be modified to check if the access is allowed before setting the KUAP to blocked. This can be done by moving the check before the set_kuap call. The corrected function should look like this: static inline void allow_user_access(void __user *to, const void __user *from, unsigned long size, unsigned long dir) { if (!mmu_has_feature(MMU_FTR_RAD
