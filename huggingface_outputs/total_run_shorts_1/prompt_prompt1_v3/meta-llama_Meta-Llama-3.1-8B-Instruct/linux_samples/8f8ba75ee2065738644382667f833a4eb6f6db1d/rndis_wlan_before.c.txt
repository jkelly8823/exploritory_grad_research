VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code. The newlen variable is calculated as the size of the pmkid structure plus the size of the bssid_info array times the count plus one. However, the krealloc function does not guarantee that the new buffer will be at least as large as the requested size. If the new buffer is smaller than the requested size, the pmkid structure will be truncated, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The krealloc function is used to reallocate the pmkid structure to a new size. However, the krealloc function does not guarantee that the new buffer will be at least as large as the requested size. This means that if the new buffer is smaller than the requested size, the pmkid structure will be truncated, leading to a buffer overflow. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of the krealloc function to ensure that the new buffer is at least as large as the requested size. If the new buffer is smaller than the requested size, the code should handle the error and prevent the buffer overflow.
