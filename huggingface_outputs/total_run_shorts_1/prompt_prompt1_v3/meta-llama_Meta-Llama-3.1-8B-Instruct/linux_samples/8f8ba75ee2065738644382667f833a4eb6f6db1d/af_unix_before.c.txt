VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a double-free vulnerability. The line `if (NULL == siocb->scm) siocb->scm = &tmp_scm;` is executed twice, which can lead to a double-free error when the `scm_send` function is called. This is because the `tmp_scm` pointer is assigned to `siocb->scm` twice, and the `scm_send` function may attempt to free the memory pointed to by `siocb->scm` twice, resulting in a double-free error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the duplicate assignment of `tmp_scm` to `siocb->scm`. The corrected code should be: `if (NULL == siocb->scm) siocb->scm = &tmp_scm; wait_for_unix_gc(); err = scm_send(sock, msg, siocb->scm); if (err < 0) return err; err = -EOPNOTSUPP;` This ensures that the `tmp_s
