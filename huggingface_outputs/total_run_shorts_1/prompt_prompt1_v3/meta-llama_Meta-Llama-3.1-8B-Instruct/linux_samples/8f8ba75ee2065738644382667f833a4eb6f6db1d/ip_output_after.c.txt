VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the `opt->optlen>>2` expression to calculate the new `ihl` value without checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed value.
EXPLANATION: The `opt->optlen` value is not validated before being used to calculate the new `ihl` value. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `opt->optlen` is greater than the maximum allowed value, which can result in a denial of service or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate the `opt->optlen` value before using it to calculate the new `ihl` value. Check if `opt->optlen` is within the valid range (0-15) before performing the calculation. If it is not, return an error or handle it accordingly. Additionally, consider using a safer method to calculate the new `ihl` value, such as using a fixed value or a more robust calculation method.  The `ip_options_build` function should also be reviewed to ensure it does not introduce any additional vulnerabilities.  The `opt->optlen` value should be validated before being passed
