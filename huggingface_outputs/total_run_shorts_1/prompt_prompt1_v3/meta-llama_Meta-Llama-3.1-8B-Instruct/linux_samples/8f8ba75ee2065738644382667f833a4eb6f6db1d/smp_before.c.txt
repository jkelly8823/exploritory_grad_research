VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The test_and_set_bit function is used to atomically set a bit in the HCI_CONN_LE_SMP_PEND flag. However, the subsequent creation of the SMP channel is not protected by any synchronization mechanism. This means that if multiple threads attempt to create the SMP channel simultaneously, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the SMP channel created by another thread, leading to a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The test_and_set_bit function is used to atomically set a bit in the HCI_CONN_LE_SMP_PEND flag. However, the subsequent creation of the SMP channel is not protected by any synchronization mechanism. This means that if multiple threads attempt to create the SMP channel simultaneously, it is possible for one thread to overwrite the SMP channel created by another thread, leading to a race condition. The SMP channel is created using the smp_chan_create function, which is not thread-safe. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a semaphore, to protect the creation of the SMP channel. One possible solution
