VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the goto statement.
EXPLANATION: The use of the goto statement can lead to unpredictable control flow, making it difficult to track the execution of the code. This can result in buffer overflows if the code is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Avoid using the goto statement and instead use structured programming techniques to control the flow of the code. Use if-else statements or loops to ensure that the code is executed in a predictable manner. Additionally, ensure that all variables are properly sanitized before being used to prevent buffer overflows.  Use a linter or code analyzer to identify potential issues with the code.  Consider using a code review process to ensure that the code is properly reviewed and tested before it is deployed.  Consider using a secure coding practice such as secure coding guidelines or secure coding standards to ensure that the code is secure.  Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.  Consider using a code review tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
