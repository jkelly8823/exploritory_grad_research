VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of sizeof(*xdst) - sizeof(*dst) in the memset function. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow if the size of xdst is not correctly calculated.
EXPLANATION: The memset function is used to clear the memory of the dst pointer. However, the size of the memory to be cleared is calculated using sizeof(*xdst) - sizeof(*dst). This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of xdst is not correctly calculated. This is because the size of xdst is not guaranteed to be larger than the size of dst. If the size of xdst is smaller, then the memset function will write beyond the bounds of the dst pointer, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the memory to be cleared should be calculated using the correct size of the dst pointer. This can be done by using sizeof(*dst) instead of sizeof(*xdst) - sizeof(*dst). Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the size of xdst is correctly calculated and that the memset function is not writing beyond
