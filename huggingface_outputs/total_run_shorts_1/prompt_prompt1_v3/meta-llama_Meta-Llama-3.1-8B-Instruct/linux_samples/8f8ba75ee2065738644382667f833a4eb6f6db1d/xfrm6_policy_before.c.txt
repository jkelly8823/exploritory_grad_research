VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A memory leak vulnerability is present due to a missing assignment of the 'path' pointer in the 'xfrm6_init_path' function.
EXPLANATION: The 'xfrm6_init_path' function is supposed to initialize the 'path' pointer with the 'dst' pointer. However, the assignment is missing, which can lead to a memory leak when the 'path' pointer is used later in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The missing assignment should be added to the 'xfrm6_init_path' function. The corrected code should look like this: 'path->get_saddr = xfrm6_get_saddr; path->decode_session = _decode_session6; path->get_tos = xfrm6_get_tos; path->init_path = xfrm6_init_path; path->fill_dst = xfrm6_fill_dst; path->blackhole_route = ip6_blackhole_route;'. Additionally, the 'path' pointer should be checked for null before using it to prevent a null pointer dereference.  The corrected code should look like this: 'if (path!= NULL) {... }'.
