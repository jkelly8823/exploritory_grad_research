VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the BUILD_BUG_ON macro to check the size of skb->queue_mapping and qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->slave_dev_queue_mapping. This macro is used to check for size mismatches at compile-time, but it does not prevent a buffer overflow at runtime.
EXPLANATION: The BUILD_BUG_ON macro is used to check if the size of skb->queue_mapping and qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->slave_dev_queue_mapping are equal. However, this check is performed at compile-time, not at runtime. This means that if the sizes are not equal at compile-time, the code will not compile. However, if the sizes are equal at compile-time but become unequal at runtime due to a buffer overflow, the code will not detect the overflow and will continue to execute, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a runtime check to ensure that the sizes of skb->queue_mapping and qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->slave_dev_queue_mapping are equal. This can be done using a function like memcpy or memcmp to compare the
