VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The variable `newtp` is assigned the value of `tcp_sk(newsk)` but then the `newsk` pointer is potentially freed before the `newtp` pointer is used. This could lead to a use-after-free error if the `newsk` pointer is freed before the `newtp` pointer is used.
EXPLANATION: The `tcp_v4_mtu_reduced` function is called when the socket is not owned by the user, but the `set_bit` function is called when the socket is owned by the user. This suggests that the socket may be freed before the `newtp` pointer is used. Additionally, the `goto` statement is used to jump to the `exit_nonewsk` label, which may also lead to the `newsk` pointer being freed before the `newtp` pointer is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `newtp` pointer should be assigned the value of `tcp_sk(newsk)` after the `newsk` pointer is guaranteed to not be freed. This can be achieved by moving the
