VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this function. The spin_lock_irqsave() call is not sufficient to prevent concurrent access to the chan->state field.
EXPLANATION: The spin_lock_irqsave() call only protects access to the lock, but does not prevent other threads from accessing the chan->state field. This can lead to a race condition where multiple threads try to access and modify the chan->state field simultaneously.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the chan->state field should be protected by the same lock that is used to protect the lock. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the chan->state field is not accessed outside of the lock. Alternatively, the chan->state field can be made atomic by using an atomic variable type. However, this would require significant changes to the code and may not be feasible in all cases. A more straightforward solution would be to use a spinlock to protect the chan->state field, like this: spin_lock_irqsave(&ctlr->lock, flags); if (chan->state!= CPDMA_STATE_IDLE) { spin_lock(&chan->lock); if (chan->state!=
