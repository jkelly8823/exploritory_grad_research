VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code. The newlen variable is calculated as the size of the original pmkids structure plus the size of the bssid_info array multiplied by the count plus one. However, this calculation does not account for the size of the bssid_info array itself, which is not included in the sizeof(pmkids->bssid_info[0]) expression. This means that the newlen variable will be too small to hold the new pmkid, leading to a buffer overflow when krealloc is called.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the sizeof(pmkids->bssid_info[0]) expression only returns the size of a single element in the bssid_info array, not the size of the entire array. This means that the newlen variable will not account for the size of the array itself, leading to a buffer overflow when krealloc is called. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, where the program attempts to write more data to a buffer than it is designed to hold.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the newlen variable should be calculated as the size of the original pm
