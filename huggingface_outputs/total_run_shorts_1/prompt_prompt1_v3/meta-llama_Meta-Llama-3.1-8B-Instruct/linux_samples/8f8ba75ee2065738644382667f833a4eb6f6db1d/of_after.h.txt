VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference when the parent node has no children. This is because the for_each_child_of_node and for_each_available_child_of_node macros do not check if the parent node has any children before iterating over them.
EXPLANATION: The for_each_child_of_node and for_each_available_child_of_node macros use the of_get_next_child and of_get_next_available_child functions to iterate over the children of a given parent node. However, these functions do not check if the parent node has any children before returning the next child. If the parent node has no children, the functions will return NULL, and the macros will attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the macros should be modified to check if the parent node has any children before iterating over them. This can be done by calling of_get_child_count to get the number of children of the parent node, and then checking if this number is greater than 0 before iterating over the children. If the number of children is 0, the loop should be skipped. Here is an
