VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The variable'match' is used after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The variable'match' is freed when the function 'fanout_add' returns due to an error. However, the function'match_fanout_group' still uses the variable'match' after it has been freed. This is a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable'match' should be freed before the function'match_fanout_group' is called. Alternatively, the function'match_fanout_group' should be called before the variable'match' is freed. The variable'match' should be declared as a local variable within the function 'fanout_add' to prevent it from being freed prematurely. The function 'fanout_add' should be modified to handle the error 'err' before freeing the variable'match'. The function 'fanout_add' should be modified to check if the variable'match' is NULL before using it.  The function 'fanout_add' should be modified to free the variable'match' only when the function is successful.  The
