VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the sizeof operator on a pointer to a struct. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the struct is not properly initialized or if the sizeof operator returns an incorrect size.
EXPLANATION: The sizeof operator is used to calculate the size of the struct pointed to by haddr. However, this can lead to a buffer overflow if the struct is not properly initialized or if the sizeof operator returns an incorrect size. This is because the sizeof operator returns the size of the struct in bytes, which can be larger than the size of the buffer allocated for the struct. If the buffer is not large enough to hold the struct, a buffer overflow will occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the buffer should be checked before assigning the result of the sizeof operator to addr_len. This can be done by using the offsetof macro to get the offset of the last member of the struct and adding 1 to it. The result should then be compared to the size of the buffer to ensure that it is large enough to hold the struct. If the buffer is not large enough, an error should be
