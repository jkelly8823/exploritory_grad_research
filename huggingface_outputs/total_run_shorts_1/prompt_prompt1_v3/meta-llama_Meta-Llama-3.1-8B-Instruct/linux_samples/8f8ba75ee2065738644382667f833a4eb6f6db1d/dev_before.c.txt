VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The function `deliver_skb` is called with a pointer to `skb2` which is a local variable that may have gone out of scope by the time `deliver_skb` is called.
EXPLANATION: The function `deliver_skb` is called with a pointer to `skb2` which is a local variable. However, the function `deliver_skb` may be called after the function `deliver_skb2` has returned, which means that `skb2` may have gone out of scope. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if `skb2` is accessed after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function `deliver_skb` should be called before the function `deliver_skb2` returns. Alternatively, the pointer to `skb2` should be passed to `deliver_skb` as an argument, so that it is not lost when the function returns. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that `skb2` is not accessed after it has been freed.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that `skb2` is not
