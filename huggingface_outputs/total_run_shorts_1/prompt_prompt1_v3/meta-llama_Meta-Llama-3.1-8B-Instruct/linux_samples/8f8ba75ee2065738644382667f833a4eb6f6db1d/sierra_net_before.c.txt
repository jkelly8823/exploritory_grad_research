VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sierra_net_get_fw_attr` function. The `numendpoints` variable is assigned the value of `intf->cur_altsetting->desc.bNumEndpoints` without any bounds checking. If the value of `bNumEndpoints` is greater than 3, it will cause a buffer overflow when the `if (numendpoints!= 3)` statement is executed.
EXPLANATION: The `numendpoints` variable is assigned the value of `intf->cur_altsetting->desc.bNumEndpoints` without any bounds checking. This means that if the value of `bNumEndpoints` is greater than 3, it will cause a buffer overflow when the `if (numendpoints!= 3)` statement is executed. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the value of `bNumEndpoints` is within the expected range. For example, you can add a check to ensure that `bNumEndpoints` is less than or equal to 3 before assigning it to `
