 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The function xfrm6_init_dst is called with a pointer to a struct xfrm_dst, which is then cast to a struct rt6_info. However, the struct xfrm_dst is not guaranteed to be valid at the time the function is called, as it is passed as an argument to the function. This can lead to a use-after-free error if the struct xfrm_dst is freed before the function is called.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is present because the function xfrm6_init_dst is called with a pointer to a struct xfrm_dst, which is then cast to a struct rt6_info. However, the struct xfrm_dst is not guaranteed to be valid at the time the function is called, as it is passed as an argument to the function. This can lead to a use-after-free error if the struct xfrm_dst is freed before the function is called. The function xfrm6_init_dst assumes that the struct xfrm_dst is valid and can be safely cast to a struct rt6_info, but this assumption may not always be true.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To
