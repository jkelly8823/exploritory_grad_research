 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The test_and_set_bit function is used to atomically set a bit in the HCI_CONN_LE_SMP_PEND flag. However, the subsequent creation of the smp_chan is not atomic, and another thread may see the flag as set before the smp_chan is created, leading to a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The test_and_set_bit function is used to atomically set a bit in the HCI_CONN_LE_SMP_PEND flag. However, the subsequent creation of the smp_chan is not atomic, and another thread may see the flag as set before the smp_chan is created, leading to a race condition. This is because the creation of the smp_chan is not protected by any synchronization mechanism, and another thread may see the flag as set before the smp_chan is created.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the creation of the smp_chan should be protected by a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a spinlock. This will ensure that the smp_chan is created atomically, and the race condition is avoided. For example, the code could be modified
