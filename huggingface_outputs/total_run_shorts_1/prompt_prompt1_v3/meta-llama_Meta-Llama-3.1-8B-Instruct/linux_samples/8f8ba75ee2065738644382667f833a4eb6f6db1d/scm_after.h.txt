VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the unix_get_peersec_dgram function call. This function is not checked for its return value, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the function fails.
EXPLANATION: The unix_get_peersec_dgram function is called without checking its return value. If this function fails, it could potentially lead to a buffer overflow in the scm structure. This is because the function is not checked for its return value, and the scm structure is not checked for its size before being used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The return value of unix_get_peersec_dgram should be checked to ensure that it does not fail. If it does fail, an error should be returned to prevent a potential buffer overflow. Additionally, the size of the scm structure should be checked before it is used to prevent a buffer overflow. This can be done by calling the sizeof function on the scm structure before using it. For example: if (sizeof(*scm)!= unix_get_peersec_dgram(sock, scm)) { return -1; }  This will prevent a buffer overflow from occurring if the unix_get_peersec_dgram function fails.
