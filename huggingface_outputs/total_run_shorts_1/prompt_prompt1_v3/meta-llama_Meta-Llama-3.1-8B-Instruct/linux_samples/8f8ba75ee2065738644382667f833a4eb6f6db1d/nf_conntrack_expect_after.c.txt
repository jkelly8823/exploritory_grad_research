VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential race condition exists in the code. The function nf_ct_expect_check() is not thread-safe. It iterates over a hash table of nf_conntrack_expect objects, but it does not properly synchronize access to this data structure. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes when multiple threads access the same hash table simultaneously.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the function nf_ct_expect_check() is not protected by any synchronization mechanism. It directly accesses and modifies the hash table of nf_conntrack_expect objects, which can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently. This can result in a race condition, where one thread is iterating over the hash table while another thread is modifying it, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function nf_ct_expect_check() should be protected by a mutex or a spinlock to ensure that only one thread can access the hash table at a time. This can be achieved by acquiring a lock before iterating over the hash table and releasing the lock after the iteration is complete. Additionally, the function nf_ct_expect_put() should also be protected by the same lock to ensure that the
