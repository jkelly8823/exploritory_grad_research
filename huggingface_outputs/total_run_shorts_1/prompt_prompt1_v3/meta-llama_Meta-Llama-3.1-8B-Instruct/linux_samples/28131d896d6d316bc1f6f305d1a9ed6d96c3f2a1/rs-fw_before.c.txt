VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow in the `rs_pretty_print_rate` function. This is because the `sizeof(pretty_rate)` is used as the maximum size for the buffer, but the function does not check if the actual size of the string being printed is less than or equal to this size.
EXPLANATION: The `rs_pretty_print_rate` function is called with a buffer of size 100, but it does not check if the string being printed is less than or equal to this size. If the string is longer than 100 characters, it will overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `rs_pretty_print_rate` function should be modified to check if the actual size of the string being printed is less than or equal to the size of the buffer. This can be done by using the `snprintf` function instead of `rs_pretty_print_rate`, which allows for specifying the maximum number of characters to be written to the buffer. Alternatively, the buffer size can be increased to accommodate longer strings. However, increasing the buffer size may not
