 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if the `vif_priv` pointer is null before dereferencing it. If `wcn36xx_vif_to_priv(vif)` returns a null pointer, the code will attempt to access memory at address 0, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Before dereferencing the `vif_priv` pointer, the code should check if it is null and handle the case where it is null. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the line `if (!vif_priv->allow_bmps)`. For example: `if (vif_priv!= NULL &&!vif_priv->allow_bmps)`. This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure the code behaves correctly even when `wcn36xx_vif_to_priv(vif)` returns a null pointer.  Please note that the line number is 14 because the line `if (!vif_priv->allow_bmps)` is the first line that dereferences the `vif_priv` pointer. However, the vulnerability is
