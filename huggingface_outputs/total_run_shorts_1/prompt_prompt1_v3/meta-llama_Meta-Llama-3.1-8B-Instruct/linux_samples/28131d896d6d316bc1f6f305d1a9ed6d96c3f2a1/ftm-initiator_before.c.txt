VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the index variable 'i' in the 'fw_ap' pointer assignment.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the 'iwl_mvm_ftm_resp_size_validation' function. The 'fw_ap' pointer is assigned the address of 'fw_resp_v8->ap[i]' or 'fw_resp_v7->ap[i]' without checking if the index 'i' is within the valid range of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if 'i' is greater than or equal to the size of the array, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the index variable 'i' to ensure it is within the valid range of the array. This can be done by checking if 'i' is less than the size of the array before assigning the 'fw_ap' pointer. For example: if (i < sizeof(fw_resp_v8->ap) / sizeof(fw_resp_v8->ap[0])) { fw_ap = &fw_resp_v8->
