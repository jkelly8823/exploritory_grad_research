VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for NULL pointer dereferences when accessing the 'wifi_pkg' pointer in the 'iwl_acpi_get_wifi_pkg_range' function.
EXPLANATION: The 'iwl_acpi_get_wifi_pkg_range' function returns a pointer to a 'union acpi_object' structure, but it does not check if the pointer is NULL before accessing its members. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the function fails to allocate memory or if the 'wifi_pkg' pointer is not properly initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check for NULL pointer dereferences when accessing the 'wifi_pkg' pointer. This can be done by adding a simple NULL check before accessing the 'wifi_pkg' pointer. For example: if (wifi_pkg!= NULL) {... } else {... }.
