VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the len variable in the memcpy function without checking if it is within the bounds of the image->sec[sec_idx].data array.
EXPLANATION: The len variable is used as the size argument in the memcpy function without any bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the len variable is larger than the size of the image->sec[sec_idx].data array. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that the len variable is within the bounds of the image->sec[sec_idx].data array before using it as the size argument in the memcpy function. This can be done by checking if len is less than or equal to the size of the image->sec[sec_idx].data array. If it is not, then handle the error accordingly. For example: if (len > image->sec[sec_idx].len) { /* handle error */ } else { memcpy(page_address(block->fw_paging_block), image->sec[sec_idx].data + offset,
