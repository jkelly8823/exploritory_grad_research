VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file for a Linux kernel module, and it defines some constants and a struct. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet defines some constants and a struct, but it does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability. The constants are defined using the #define directive, which is a preprocessor directive that simply replaces the constant with its value. The struct is defined using the struct keyword, which is a C programming language construct for defining a struct. There are no function calls, variable assignments, or other code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. This code snippet appears to be safe and does not require any changes.  Please note that this code snippet is a header file and does not contain any executable code. It is intended to be included in other source files that contain the actual implementation of the Linux kernel module.  Therefore, any vulnerabilities would likely be introduced in the source files that include this header file.  However, based on the information provided, there are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.  It is always a
