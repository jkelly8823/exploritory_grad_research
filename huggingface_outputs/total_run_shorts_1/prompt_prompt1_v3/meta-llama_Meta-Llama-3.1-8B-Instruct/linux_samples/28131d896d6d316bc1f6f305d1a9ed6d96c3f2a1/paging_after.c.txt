VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the len variable in the memcpy function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The len variable is used to copy data from the image->sec[sec_idx].data array to the page_address(fwrt->fw_paging_db[0].fw_paging_block) and page_address(block->fw_paging_block) arrays. However, the len variable is not checked for validity before being used in the memcpy function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the len variable is larger than the size of the destination array, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the len variable before using it in the memcpy function. This can be done by checking if the len variable is less than or equal to the size of the destination array. If it is not, return an error or handle the situation accordingly. Additionally, consider using a safer function like strlcpy or snprintf to copy data, as they provide bounds checking and can help prevent buffer overflows.
