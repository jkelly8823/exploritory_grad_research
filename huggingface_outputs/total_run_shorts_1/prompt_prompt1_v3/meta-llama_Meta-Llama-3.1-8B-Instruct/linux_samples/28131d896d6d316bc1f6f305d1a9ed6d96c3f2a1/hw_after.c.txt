VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the pdev_idx parameter in the ath11k_hw_ipq8074_mac_from_pdev_id function.
EXPLANATION: The ath11k_hw_ipq8074_mac_from_pdev_id function takes an integer parameter pdev_idx but does not perform any bounds checking on this parameter. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by passing a large value for pdev_idx, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the ath11k_hw_ipq8074_mac_from_pdev_id function to ensure that the pdev_idx parameter is within a valid range. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if pdev_idx is within the expected range before using it to access the buffer. For example: if (pdev_idx < 0 || pdev_idx >= ATH11K_MAX_PDEV) return -EINVAL;. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a fixed-size array, to store the buffer data. This would prevent buffer overflows even if the bounds checking is not implemented correctly.
