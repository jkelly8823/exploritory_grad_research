VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `mask` variable in the `mt76_set_irq_mask` function.
EXPLANATION: The `mt76_set_irq_mask` function takes a `mask` variable as an argument, but it does not perform any bounds checking on this variable. This means that if a large value is passed to the function, it may overflow the buffer and cause undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `mt76_set_irq_mask` function should be modified to perform bounds checking on the `mask` variable. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the value of `mask` is within a valid range. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where the buffer is overflowed, such as by returning an error code or panicking.
