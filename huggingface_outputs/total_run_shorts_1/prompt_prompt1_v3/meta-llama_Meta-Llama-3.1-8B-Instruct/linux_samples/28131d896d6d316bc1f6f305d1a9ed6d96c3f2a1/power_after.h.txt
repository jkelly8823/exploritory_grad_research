VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking in the struct iwl_per_chain_offset table.
EXPLANATION: The struct iwl_per_chain_offset table is defined with a fixed size of IWL_NUM_GEO_PROFILES elements, each containing IWL_NUM_BANDS_PER_CHAIN_V1 or IWL_NUM_BANDS_PER_CHAIN_V2 elements. However, the union iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd does not perform any bounds checking on the table size before accessing it. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer by providing a large table size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the union iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd to ensure that the table size does not exceed the maximum allowed size. This can be done by adding a check before accessing the table to ensure that the table size is within the valid range. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to avoid buffer overflow attacks.
