 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the rx_buf_rbm parameter.
EXPLANATION: The function ath11k_dp_rxbufs_replenish is called with the rx_buf_rbm parameter, which is not checked for bounds. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of rx_buf_rbm is larger than the actual size of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the rx_buf_rbm parameter to prevent buffer overflows. For example, you can add a check to ensure that rx_buf_rbm is within the valid range of the buffer size. Additionally, consider using a safer function that does not require manual bounds checking.  The line 14 is the line where the function is called. The function is called with the rx_buf_rbm parameter which is not checked for bounds. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of rx_buf_rbm is larger than the actual size of the buffer. The function should be called with a safe value for the rx_buf_rbm parameter. The safe value for the rx_buf_rbm parameter should be within the valid range of
