VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a variable length array (VLA) in the struct iwl_wowlan_status. The VLA is declared as u8 wake_packet[]; /* can be truncated from _length to _bufsize */ and is used to store a wakeup packet. However, the size of the array is not checked before it is used, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the packet is larger than the allocated size.
EXPLANATION: The use of a VLA in this context is problematic because it allows the size of the array to be determined at runtime, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the size is not checked. This is a common vulnerability in C code, and it can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the wake_packet array should be fixed and not variable. This can be done by replacing the VLA with a fixed-size array, such as u8 wake_packet[1024];. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the size of the array is always
