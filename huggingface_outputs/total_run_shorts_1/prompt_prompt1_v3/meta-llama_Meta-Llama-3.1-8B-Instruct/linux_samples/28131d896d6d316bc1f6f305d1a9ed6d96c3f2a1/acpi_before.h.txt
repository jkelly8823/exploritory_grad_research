VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of ACPI_WGDS_WIFI_DATA_SIZE_REV0 and ACPI_WGDS_WIFI_DATA_SIZE_REV2. The calculation involves multiplying large numbers and adding 1, which can lead to an integer overflow and potentially cause a buffer overflow when accessing the calculated size.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines several constants and macros related to ACPI and WiFi data sizes. However, the calculation of ACPI_WGDS_WIFI_DATA_SIZE_REV0 and ACPI_WGDS_WIFI_DATA_SIZE_REV2 involves multiplying large numbers and adding 1, which can lead to an integer overflow. This can cause the calculated size to be larger than the actual buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow when accessing the calculated size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a safer method for calculating the buffer size, such as using a larger data type (e.g., u64) or using a library function that handles integer overflows. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the calculated size is not used to access a buffer without checking its bounds. The following code snippet shows an example of
