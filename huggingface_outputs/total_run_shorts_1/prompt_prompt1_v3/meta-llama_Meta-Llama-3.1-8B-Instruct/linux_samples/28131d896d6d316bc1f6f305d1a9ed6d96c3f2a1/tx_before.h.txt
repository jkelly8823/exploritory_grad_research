VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of variable-length arrays (VLAs) in the struct definitions.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines several structs with variable-length arrays (VLAs) such as `struct iwl_dram_sec_info dram_info;`, `struct ieee80211_hdr hdr[];`, `struct iwl_mvm_compressed_ba_ratid ra_tid[0];`, and `struct iwl_mvm_compressed_ba_tfd tfd[];`. These VLAs can lead to buffer overflows if not properly initialized or accessed, which can result in security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using fixed-size arrays or dynamically allocated memory instead of VLAs. Additionally, ensure that all VLAs are properly initialized and accessed to prevent buffer overflows. It is also recommended to use a safer alternative to VLAs, such as `struct ieee80211_hdr hdr[IEEE80211_MAX_DATA_LEN];`, where `IEEE80211_MAX_DATA_LEN` is a constant representing the maximum allowed length of the array. This will help prevent buffer overflows and ensure the code is
