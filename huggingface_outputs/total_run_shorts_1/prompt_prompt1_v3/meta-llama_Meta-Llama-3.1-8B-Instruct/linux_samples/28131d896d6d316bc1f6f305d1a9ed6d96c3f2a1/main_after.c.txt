VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of the GENMASK macro with a value of 7, which is too large for the size of the ht_mcs and vht_mcs arrays.
EXPLANATION: The GENMASK macro is used to create a mask of a specified size, but in this case, the size is too large for the arrays ht_mcs and vht_mcs. This can cause a buffer overflow when the memset function is called, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The size of the GENMASK macro should be reduced to match the size of the arrays ht_mcs and vht_mcs. For example, the line `memset(mvif->bitrate_mask.control[i].ht_mcs, GENMASK(7, 0), sizeof(mvif->bitrate_mask.control[i].ht_mcs));` should be changed to `memset(mvif->bitrate_mask.control[i].ht_mcs, GENMASK(3, 0), sizeof(mvif->bitrate_mask.control[i].ht_mcs));` to prevent the buffer overflow. Similarly, the line `
