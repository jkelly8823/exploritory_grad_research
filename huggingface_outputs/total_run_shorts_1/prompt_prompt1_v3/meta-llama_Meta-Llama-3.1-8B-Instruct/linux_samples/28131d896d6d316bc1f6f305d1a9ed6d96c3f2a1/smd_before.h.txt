VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of input validation for the `bssid` and `vif` parameters in the `wcn36xx_smd_join` function.
EXPLANATION: The `wcn36xx_smd_join` function takes a `bssid` parameter of type `const u8 *` and a `vif` parameter of type `u8 *`. However, there is no input validation to ensure that these parameters do not exceed the maximum allowed buffer size. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker provides a large `bssid` or `vif` value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should include input validation for the `bssid` and `vif` parameters to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum allowed buffer size. This can be achieved by checking the length of the `bssid` and `vif` arrays before passing them to the `wcn36xx_smd_join` function. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as `const char *`, to represent the `bssid` and `v
