VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains multiple instances of potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The sysfs_emit function is used to format and write data to a buffer, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the data being written. This means that if the data being written is larger than the buffer, it can overflow and potentially cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The sysfs_emit function is used to format and write data to a buffer. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the data being written. This means that if the data being written is larger than the buffer, it can overflow and potentially cause a buffer overflow vulnerability. In this code snippet, the sysfs_emit function is used multiple times to write data to a buffer, but the data being written is not checked for bounds. This makes the code vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform bounds checking on the data being written to the buffer. This can be done by checking the length of
