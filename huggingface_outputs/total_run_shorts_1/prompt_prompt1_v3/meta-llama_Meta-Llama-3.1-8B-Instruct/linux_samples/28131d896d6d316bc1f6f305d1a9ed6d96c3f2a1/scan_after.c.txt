VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the BIT macro to shift the value of mvm->scan_last_antenna_idx. This can result in an integer overflow if the value of mvm->scan_last_antenna_idx is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The BIT macro is used to shift the value of mvm->scan_last_antenna_idx by RATE_MCS_ANT_POS bits. However, if mvm->scan_last_antenna_idx is greater than or equal to (1 << RATE_MCS_ANT_POS), this will result in an integer overflow, causing the value of tx_ant to be incorrect. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for integer overflow before shifting the value of mvm->scan_last_antenna_idx. This can be done by checking if mvm->scan_last_antenna_idx is greater than or equal to (1 << RATE_MCS_ANT_POS) before applying the shift operation. If it is, the code should handle the overflow accordingly. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a safer method of shifting the value,
