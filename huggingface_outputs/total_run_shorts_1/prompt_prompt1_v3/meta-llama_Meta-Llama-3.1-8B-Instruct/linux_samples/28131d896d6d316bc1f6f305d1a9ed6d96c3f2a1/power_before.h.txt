VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the lack of bounds checking on the table array in the iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd_v1, iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd_v2, and iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd_v3 structs.
EXPLANATION: The structs iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd_v1, iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd_v2, and iwl_geo_tx_power_profiles_cmd_v3 contain an array table of size IWL_NUM_GEO_PROFILES * IWL_NUM_BANDS_PER_CHAIN_V1 and IWL_NUM_GEO_PROFILES * IWL_NUM_BANDS_PER_CHAIN_V2 respectively. However, there is no bounds checking on this array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of profiles or bands exceeds the allocated size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the table array to ensure that the number of profiles and bands does not exceed the allocated size. This can be done by adding a check before accessing the array to ensure that the index is within the valid range. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a dynamically allocated array or
