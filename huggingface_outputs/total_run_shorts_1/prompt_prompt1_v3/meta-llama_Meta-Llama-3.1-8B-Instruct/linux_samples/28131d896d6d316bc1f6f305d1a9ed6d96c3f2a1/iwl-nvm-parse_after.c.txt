VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a hardcoded array size (ARRAY_SIZE(iwl_vendor_caps)) to determine the length of the vendor_elems.data array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a hardcoded array size (ARRAY_SIZE(iwl_vendor_caps)) to determine the length of the vendor_elems.data array. However, the vendor_elems.data array is assigned a value from the iwl_vendor_caps array, which has a length of 6. If the iwl_vendor_caps array is modified to have a length greater than 6, the vendor_elems.data array will be assigned a value that is out of bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the actual length of the iwl_vendor_caps array instead of the hardcoded array size. This can be done by replacing ARRAY_SIZE(iwl_vendor_caps) with the actual length of the iwl_vendor_caps array. For example: iftype_data->vendor_elems.len = sizeof(iwl_vendor_caps) / sizeof(iwl_vendor_caps[0]);. This will ensure that the vendor_elems.data array is assigned a value that is within
