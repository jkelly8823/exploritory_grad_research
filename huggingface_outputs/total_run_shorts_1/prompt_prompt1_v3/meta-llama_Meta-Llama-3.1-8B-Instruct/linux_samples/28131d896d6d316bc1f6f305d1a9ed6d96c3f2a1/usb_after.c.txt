VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly check for null pointer dereferences when accessing card->rx_cmd_ep and card->tx_cmd_ep. This can lead to a segmentation fault if either of these pointers is null.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if card->rx_cmd_ep and card->tx_cmd_ep are null before accessing them, but it does not check if they are null before passing them to the mwifiex_add_card function. This can lead to a segmentation fault if either of these pointers is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add null checks for card->rx_cmd_ep and card->tx_cmd_ep before passing them to the mwifiex_add_card function. For example: if (card->rx_cmd_ep && card->tx_cmd_ep) {... } else { return -ENODEV; }
