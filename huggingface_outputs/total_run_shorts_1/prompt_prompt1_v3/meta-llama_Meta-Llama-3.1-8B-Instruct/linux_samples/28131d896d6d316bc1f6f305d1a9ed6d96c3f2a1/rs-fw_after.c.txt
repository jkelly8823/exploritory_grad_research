VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the function rs_pretty_print_rate_v1. The function writes to a fixed-size buffer (pretty_rate) without checking the length of the string it writes. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is longer than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The function rs_pretty_print_rate_v1 writes to the buffer pretty_rate without checking the length of the string it writes. The buffer size is fixed at 100 characters, but the function does not check if the string it writes is longer than this size. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function rs_pretty_print_rate_v1 should be modified to check the length of the string it writes before writing to the buffer. This can be done by using the strlen function to get the length of the string and then checking if it is less than the buffer size. If it is not, the function should return an error or handle the overflow in some other way. Alternatively, the buffer size can be increased to a larger value
