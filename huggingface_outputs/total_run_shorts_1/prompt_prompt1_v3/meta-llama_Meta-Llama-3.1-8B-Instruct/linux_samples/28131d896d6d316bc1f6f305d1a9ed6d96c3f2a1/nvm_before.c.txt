VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple conditional statement that checks the return value of iwl_mvm_get_sar_geo_profile(). If the return value is less than 0, it prints a debug message indicating that SAR WGDS is disabled. Otherwise, it prints a debug message indicating that a specific geo profile is configured. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a straightforward and safe implementation.  Please note that this code snippet does not handle the case where wgds_tbl_idx is 0, which might be a valid value. However, this is not a vulnerability in the classical sense, but rather a potential edge case that might need to be handled depending on the specific requirements of the system.  In general, the code looks clean and safe.  It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.  It does not contain any obvious memory leaks or other issues that could lead to security problems.  It does not contain any obvious race conditions or other concurrency issues that could lead to security problems
