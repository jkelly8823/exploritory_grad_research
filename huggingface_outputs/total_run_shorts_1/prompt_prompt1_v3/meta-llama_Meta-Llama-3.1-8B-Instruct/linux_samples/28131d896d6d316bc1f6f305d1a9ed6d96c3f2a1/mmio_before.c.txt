VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the size of the fixed_map array.
EXPLANATION: The fixed_map array is declared with a size of 4, but the size of each element is not checked before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of an element exceeds the size of the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the size of each element does not exceed the size of the array. This can be done by checking the size of each element before adding it to the array. For example: if (size > sizeof(fixed_map) / sizeof(fixed_map[0])) { /* handle error */ } before adding the element to the array. Alternatively, consider using a dynamically allocated array to avoid this issue.  ```c
		u32 mapped;
		u32 size;
	} fixed_map[] = {
		{ 0x54000000, 0x02000, 0x1000 }, /* WFDMA PCIE0 MCU DMA0 */
		{ 0x55000000, 0x03000,
