VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the use of a pointer to a local variable in a function call.
EXPLANATION: The function iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2 is called with a pointer to a local variable cmd.format_bw. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the function modifies the contents of cmd.format_bw, as it is not guaranteed to be valid after the function returns.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2 should be modified to take a pointer to a valid buffer as an argument, rather than relying on a local variable. Additionally, the function should be modified to check the bounds of the buffer before modifying its contents. The function iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v1 should also be modified to take a pointer to a valid buffer as an argument.
