VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger codebase, possibly related to UEFI firmware. It defines two constants and a function that returns an error pointer. The function is guarded by a conditional compilation directive (`#ifdef CONFIG_EFI`), which suggests that it is only compiled when the `CONFIG_EFI` configuration option is enabled. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix a vulnerability. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce any new issues.  The code snippet is well-structured and follows good coding practices.  The use of `#ifdef` directives helps to ensure that the code is only compiled when the necessary configuration options are enabled.  The function returns an error pointer, which is a good practice to handle errors in a robust way.  Overall, the code snippet appears to be
