VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The `memset` function is used to fill a buffer with a large value, but the size of the buffer is not checked. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not large enough to hold the value.
EXPLANATION: The `memset` function is used to fill the `ht_mcs` and `vht_mcs` buffers with the value `GENMASK(7, 0)` and `GENMASK(15, 0)` respectively. However, the size of these buffers is not checked before the `memset` function is called. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not large enough to hold the value. In this case, the `ht_mcs` buffer is 8 bytes long, but the value being filled into it is 8 bytes long as well. However, the `vht_mcs` buffer is 16 bytes long, but the value being filled into it is 16 bytes long as well. This is not a problem in this case, but if the size of the buffer was smaller than the value being filled into it, a
