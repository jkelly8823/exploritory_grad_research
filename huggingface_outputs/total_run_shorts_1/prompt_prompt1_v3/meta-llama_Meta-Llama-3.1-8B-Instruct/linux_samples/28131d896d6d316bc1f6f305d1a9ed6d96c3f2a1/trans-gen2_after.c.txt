VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the device is in a low power state and the firmware reset handshake is enabled. This can lead to a situation where the device is not properly reset, resulting in potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises when the device is in a low power state and the firmware reset handshake is enabled. In this case, the code attempts to reset the device using the `iwl_trans_pcie_fw_reset_handshake` function. However, this function is only called if the device's state is greater than or equal to `IWL_TRANS_FW_STARTED`. If the device is in a low power state, its state will be less than `IWL_TRANS_FW_STARTED`, and the device will not be properly reset. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to properly handle the case where the device is in a low power state and the firmware reset handshake is enabled. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the device's state is greater than or equal to `IWL_TRANS_FW_STARTED` before calling the `iwl_trans_p
