VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the mt7915_mcu_fw_log_2_host function. The data structure 'data' is not properly sanitized before being passed to the mt76_mcu_send_msg function, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The mt7915_mcu_fw_log_2_host function takes in a 'data' structure which is not properly sanitized before being passed to the mt76_mcu_send_msg function. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the 'data' structure is not properly formatted, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'data' structure should be properly sanitized before being passed to the mt76_mcu_send_msg function. This can be achieved by using a function such as kmemdup to create a copy of the 'data' structure, and then passing the copy to the mt76_mcu_send_msg function. Additionally, the mt76_mcu_send_msg function should be modified to check the length of the 'data' structure before attempting to send it. This will prevent a buffer overflow from occurring.
