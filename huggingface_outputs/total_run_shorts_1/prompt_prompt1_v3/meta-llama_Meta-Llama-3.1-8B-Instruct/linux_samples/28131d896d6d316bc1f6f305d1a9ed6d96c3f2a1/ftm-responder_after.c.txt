 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A function is calling itself recursively without a base case, which can lead to a stack overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function iwl_mvm_ftm_responder_set_bw_v2 is calling itself recursively without a base case. This can lead to a stack overflow if the function is called repeatedly. The recursive call is made when cmd_ver is greater than or equal to 7.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the recursive call should be replaced with a loop or a different approach that does not involve recursive function calls. The function should also be reviewed to ensure that it has a proper base case to prevent infinite recursion. Additionally, the function should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it does not cause a stack overflow.
