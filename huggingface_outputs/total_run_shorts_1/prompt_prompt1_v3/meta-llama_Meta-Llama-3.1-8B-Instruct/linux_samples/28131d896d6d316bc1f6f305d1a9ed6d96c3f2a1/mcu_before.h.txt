VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable-length array (VLA) without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines a struct `sta_rec_ra_fixed` with a member `phy` which is a struct `ra_phy`. However, the `ra_phy` struct contains a member `phy` which is another instance of `ra_phy`. This creates a recursive structure that can lead to a buffer overflow if not properly handled. Additionally, the use of `__packed` attribute without proper alignment checks can also lead to buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the recursive structure should be avoided by redefining the `ra_phy` struct to not contain a member `phy`. Additionally, proper bounds checking should be implemented to prevent buffer overflows. The use of `__packed` attribute should be reviewed and aligned with proper alignment checks to prevent buffer overflows.
