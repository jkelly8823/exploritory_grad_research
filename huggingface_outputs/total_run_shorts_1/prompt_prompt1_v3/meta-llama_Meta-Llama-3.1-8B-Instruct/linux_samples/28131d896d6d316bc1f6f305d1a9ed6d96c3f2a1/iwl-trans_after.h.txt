VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking in the iwl_trans_dump_data function.
EXPLANATION: The iwl_trans_dump_data function does not check the bounds of the sanitize_ops pointer before dereferencing it. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by passing a large value for the sanitize_ops pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking for the sanitize_ops pointer to prevent buffer overflows. For example, you can add a check to ensure that the sanitize_ops pointer is not NULL and that it points to a valid struct iwl_dump_sanitize_ops instance. Additionally, consider using a safer function to allocate memory for the sanitize_ops pointer, such as kmalloc.
