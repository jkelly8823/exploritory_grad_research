VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (HZ * 5) without checking the length of the data being written.
EXPLANATION: The function call to the card write function is passing a buffer of size HZ * 5, but the length of the data being written is not checked. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data is greater than the size of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the length of the data being written should be checked against the size of the buffer before the write operation. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the length of the data is less than or equal to the size of the buffer. If the length of the data is greater than the size of the buffer, an error should be returned or an alternative solution should be implemented. For example: if (len > HZ * 5) { return -1; } before the function call.  Additionally, consider using a dynamically allocated buffer to avoid fixed-size buffer limitations.  Consider using a safer function like `memcpy` with a length check to prevent buffer
