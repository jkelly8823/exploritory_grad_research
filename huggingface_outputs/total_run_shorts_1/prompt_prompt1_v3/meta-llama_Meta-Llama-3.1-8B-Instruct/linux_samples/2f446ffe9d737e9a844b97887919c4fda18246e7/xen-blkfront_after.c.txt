 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The variable gnt_list_entry is freed before it is used again.
EXPLANATION: The variable gnt_list_entry is freed in the line where it is allocated, but it is used again in the BUG_ON macro. This is a use-after-free bug because the memory pointed to by gnt_list_entry has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable gnt_list_entry should be freed after it is used in the BUG_ON macro, or it should not be freed at all. Alternatively, the BUG_ON macro should be moved before the allocation of gnt_list_entry. This will prevent the use-after-free bug.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The variable indirect_page is freed before it is used again.
EXPLANATION: The variable indirect_page is freed in the line where it is allocated, but it is used again in the list_add function. This is a use-after-free bug because the memory pointed to by indirect_page has already been freed.
