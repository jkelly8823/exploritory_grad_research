VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the report_id_hash array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to access the report_id_hash array at index 0x0d without checking if the index is within the bounds of the array. If the index is out of bounds, it will result in a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the index is within the valid range of the report_id_hash array. This can be done by checking if the index is less than the size of the array before accessing it. For example: if (0x0d < sizeof(report_id_hash) / sizeof(report_id_hash[0])) {... }. Additionally, consider using a safer indexing method, such as using a pointer arithmetic operation to calculate the index.  ```c
struct hid_report *report = hdev->report_enum[HID_FEATURE_REPORT].
				    report_id_hash[0x0d];

if (!report)
	return -EINVAL;

hid_hw_request(hdev, report, HID_REQ_GET_REPORT);
hid_hw_wait(hdev);
```
