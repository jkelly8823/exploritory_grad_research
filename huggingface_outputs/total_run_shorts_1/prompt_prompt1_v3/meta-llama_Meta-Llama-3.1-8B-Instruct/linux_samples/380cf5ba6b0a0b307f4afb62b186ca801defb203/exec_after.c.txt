VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly validate the user's credentials before setting the effective user ID (euid) and group ID (egid) of the binary being executed. This can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the euid and egid to gain elevated privileges.
EXPLANATION: The current_euid() and current_egid() functions return the current effective user ID and group ID of the process, respectively. However, these values are not validated before being assigned to the bprm->cred->euid and bprm->cred->egid fields. This means that an attacker can potentially manipulate these values to gain elevated privileges. The mnt_may_suid() and task_no_new_privs() checks are intended to prevent this, but they are not sufficient to guarantee the integrity of the euid and egid.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the user's credentials before setting the euid and egid. This can be done by checking the user's real user ID (ruid) and real group ID (rgid) against the euid and egid, respectively. The code
