VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when accessing the str array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to access the str array at index size-1 without checking if size-1 is within the valid bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if size is greater than the actual length of the array, causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that size-1 is within the valid range of the array. This can be done by checking if size-1 is greater than or equal to 0 before accessing the array. Additionally, consider using a safer method to access the array, such as using a pointer or a safer indexing method. For example: if (size > 0 && size-1 >= 0) {... } or if (size > 0) {... } to avoid accessing the array out of bounds.  Also, consider using a safer method to remove the newline character, such as using a loop to find the null-terminator.  Consider using a safer method to remove the newline character, such as using
