VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory corruption issue due to the use of the `load_bias` variable without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `load_bias` variable is used to calculate the load address of the ELF mapping, but it is not checked for overflow or underflow. This can lead to a potential memory corruption issue if the `vaddr` value is large or small enough to cause an overflow or underflow in the `load_bias` calculation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should add bounds checking for the `load_bias` variable to ensure that it does not overflow or underflow. This can be done by checking the range of the `vaddr` value and the `load_bias` calculation result before using the `load_bias` value. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer data type, such as `uint64_t`, to represent the `load_bias` value to prevent potential overflows. 

Note: The lines 14-16 refer to the lines where the `load_bias` variable is used to calculate the load address of the ELF mapping. These lines are:
