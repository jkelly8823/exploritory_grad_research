VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the cfg_entry pointer.
EXPLANATION: The OFFSET macro does not perform any bounds checking on the cfg_entry pointer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the cfg_entry pointer is pointing to an invalid location in memory. This can result in arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the OFFSET macro to ensure that the cfg_entry pointer is valid before attempting to access memory. This can be done by checking if the cfg_entry pointer is NULL or if the base_offset and field->offset are within valid memory ranges. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a struct, to represent the cfg_entry instead of a void pointer.  ```c
typedef struct cfg_entry {
	void *data;
};
```c
#define OFFSET(cfg_entry) ((cfg_entry)->base_offset+(cfg_entry)->field->offset)

/* Add fields to a device - the add_fields macro expects to get a pointer to
 * the first entry in an array (of which the ending is marked by size==0)

```c
typedef
