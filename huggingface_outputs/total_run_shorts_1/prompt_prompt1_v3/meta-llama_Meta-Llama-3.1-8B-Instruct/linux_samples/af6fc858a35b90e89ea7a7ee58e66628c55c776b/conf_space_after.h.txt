VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the data pointer.
EXPLANATION: The data pointer is declared as a void pointer, which means it can point to any type of memory location. However, there is no check to ensure that the data pointer does not exceed the bounds of the allocated memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow, where the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the data pointer does not exceed the allocated memory. This can be done by checking the size of the allocated memory and comparing it to the offset of the data pointer. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a pointer to a struct, to reduce the risk of buffer overflows.  ```c
void *data;
};

extern bool permissive;

#define OFFSET(cfg_entry) ((cfg_entry)->base_offset+(cfg_entry)->field->offset)
