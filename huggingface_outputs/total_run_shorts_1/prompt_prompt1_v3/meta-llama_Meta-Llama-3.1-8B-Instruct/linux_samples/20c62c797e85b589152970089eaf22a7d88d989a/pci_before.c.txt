VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability related to a missing return statement in the ath10k_pci_pm_suspend function.
EXPLANATION: The ath10k_pci_pm_suspend function is declared to return an integer value, but the function body does not contain a return statement. This can lead to undefined behavior when the function is called, as the return value will be indeterminate.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, a return statement should be added to the ath10k_pci_pm_suspend function, specifying a valid return value. For example: return 0; or return -EINVAL; depending on the intended behavior of the function. Additionally, the ath10k_pci_pm_resume function is missing a closing bracket, which should be added to complete the function definition.  The SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS macro is also missing a closing bracket, which should be added to complete the macro invocation.
