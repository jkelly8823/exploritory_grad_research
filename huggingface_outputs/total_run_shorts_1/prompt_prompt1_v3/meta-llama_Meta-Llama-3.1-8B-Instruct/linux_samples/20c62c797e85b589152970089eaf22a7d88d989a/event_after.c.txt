 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a function that handles some sort of scan completion event. It checks a status flag to determine if the scan was aborted, and if so, it calls a function named qtnf_scan_done. The function then returns 0 to indicate success. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None.  The code appears to be secure.  However, it would be beneficial to review the qtnf_scan_done function to ensure it is also secure.  Additionally, the function that sets the status flag should be reviewed to ensure it is not vulnerable to race conditions.  But these are not issues with the code snippet provided.
