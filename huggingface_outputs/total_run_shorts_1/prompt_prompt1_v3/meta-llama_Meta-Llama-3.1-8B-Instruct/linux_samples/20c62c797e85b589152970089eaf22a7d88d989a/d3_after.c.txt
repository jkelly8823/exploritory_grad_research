VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition when switching between images. This is because the status flags are being set without proper synchronization, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
EXPLANATION: The code sets the IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED and IWL_MVM_STATUS_D3_RECONFIG flags without any synchronization mechanism. This could lead to a race condition when multiple threads or processes are accessing the mvm->status variable simultaneously. The lack of synchronization could result in unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a spinlock, to protect access to the mvm->status variable. This would ensure that the status flags are set and cleared in a thread-safe manner. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all necessary synchronization is in place to prevent similar race conditions.  ```c
mutex_lock(&mvm->status_mutex);
set_bit(IWL_MVM_STATUS_HW_RESTART_REQUESTED, &mvm->status);
set_bit(IWL_MVM_STATUS_D3_RECONFIG, &mvm
