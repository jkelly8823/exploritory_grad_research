VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the timer_pending check and the subsequent del_timer_sync call. The timer_pending check is not atomic with respect to the timer being deleted, allowing for a potential race condition.
EXPLANATION: The timer_pending check is not atomic with respect to the timer being deleted. This means that between the time the check is made and the timer is deleted, another thread may have set the timer pending flag, resulting in the timer not being deleted. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the timer_pending check should be made atomic with respect to the timer being deleted. This can be achieved by using a spinlock to protect the timer_pending flag and the timer deletion operation. Alternatively, the timer deletion operation can be made atomic by using a lock to protect the timer_pending flag and the timer deletion operation. 

Note: The code snippet is from a Linux kernel module. The mac_lock is a mutex that protects access to the mac structure. The timer_pending function checks if a timer is pending, and the del_timer_sync function deletes a timer. The scan_req is a pointer to a scan request
