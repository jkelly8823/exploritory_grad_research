VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a driver for an Intel wireless network card. It is attempting to send a command to the device to abort a scan offload operation. The code checks the return value of the `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` function and returns it if it is non-zero. This is a good practice to handle potential errors. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
