VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for a wireless security system. It defines various constants and bitmasks for scan parameters and WSEC (wireless security) settings. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a clean and secure implementation of wireless security settings.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger system, and its security depends on the overall design and implementation of that system.  However, based on this snippet alone, there are no obvious vulnerabilities.  It is always a good idea to review the code in its entirety and consider potential security risks, but in this case, the snippet appears to be secure.  It is also worth noting that this code snippet is likely written in C, and as such, it is subject to the same security considerations as any C code.  This includes potential issues with buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and other common C security pitfalls.  However, based on this snippet
