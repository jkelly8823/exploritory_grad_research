 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the assignment of the aborted flag and the lock acquisition. This is because the assignment of the aborted flag is not protected by the lock, and another thread may access the mac->scan_req pointer before the lock is acquired.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is attempting to protect access to the mac->scan_req pointer by acquiring a lock. However, the assignment of the aborted flag is not protected by the lock, which means that another thread may access the mac->scan_req pointer before the lock is acquired. This can lead to a race condition, where the value of mac->scan_req is not what the current thread expects.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the assignment of the aborted flag should be protected by the lock. This can be achieved by moving the assignment of the aborted flag inside the lock acquisition block. For example: mutex_lock(&mac->mac_lock); if (mac->scan_req) { cfg80211_scan_done(mac->scan_req, &info);.aborted = aborted; } mutex_unlock(&mac->mac_lock); This ensures that the assignment of the aborted flag is executed after the lock
