VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a variable length array (VLA) in the for loop condition.
EXPLANATION: The variable `ret` is used to determine the upper bound of the loop, but it is not guaranteed to be a valid length. If `ret` is negative or too large, the loop will access memory outside the bounds of the `enc_buf` array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the VLA with a fixed-size array or a dynamically allocated array with bounds checking. Additionally, ensure that the value of `ret` is validated before using it as the loop upper bound. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or a list, to store the data in `enc_buf`.  The loop should be rewritten to use a safer indexing method, such as `u + 1 < (u64 *)(enc_buf + ret)` instead of `u + 1 <= (u64 *)(enc_buf + ret)`.  The use of `__le64` should be avoided as it can lead to undefined behavior when used with unaligned
