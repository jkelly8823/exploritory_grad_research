VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the repeated calls to kfree(wr_buf) without checking if wr_buf is NULL. This can lead to a double free error if wr_buf is NULL.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if wr_buf is NULL before calling kfree(wr_buf), but it does not check if wr_buf is NULL after the call to kfree(wr_buf). This means that if wr_buf is NULL, the code will attempt to free a NULL pointer, leading to a double free error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if wr_buf is NULL after the call to kfree(wr_buf) and only free the memory if it is not NULL. This can be done by adding a check after the call to kfree(wr_buf) to see if wr_buf is NULL. If it is not NULL, then the memory was successfully freed and the
