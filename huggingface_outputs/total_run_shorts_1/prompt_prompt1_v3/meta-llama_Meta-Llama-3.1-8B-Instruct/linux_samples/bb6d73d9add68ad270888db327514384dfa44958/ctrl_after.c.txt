VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the re-declaration of the variable "page_size" in the second if-else block. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The variable "page_size" is first declared and initialized in the first if-else block. However, in the second if-else block, the same variable is re-declared, which can cause the first declaration to be lost. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results. The re-declaration of the variable is unnecessary and can be removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the re-declaration of the variable "page_size" in the second if-else block. The corrected code should look like this: if (info->page_size == 0x40000000) page_size = IRDMA_PAGE_SIZE_1G; else if (info->page_size == 0x200000) page_size = IRDMA_PAGE_SIZE_2M; This will ensure that the variable is only declared once and initialized correctly.  The first if-else block can be removed as it is redundant.  The corrected code should look
