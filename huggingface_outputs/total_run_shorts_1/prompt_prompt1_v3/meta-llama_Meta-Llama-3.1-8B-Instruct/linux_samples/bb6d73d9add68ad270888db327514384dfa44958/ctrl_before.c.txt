VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the re-declaration of the variable "page_size" in the second if statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The variable "page_size" is first declared as an enum type, and then re-declared in the second if statement. This re-declaration can cause the compiler to use the new declaration, potentially leading to incorrect results. This is a classic example of a variable shadowing issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the re-declaration of the variable "page_size" in the second if statement. The corrected code should look like this: if (info->page_size == 0x40000000) page_size = IRDMA_PAGE_SIZE_1G; else if (info->page_size == 0x200000) page_size = IRDMA_PAGE_SIZE_2M; This will ensure that the variable "page_size" is only declared once, and the code will behave as intended.  The variable "page_size" should be declared only once. The corrected code should look like this: if (info->
