VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the crng_reseed function. The function first checks if the crng is ready, and if not, it calls crng_fast_load. However, the crng_fast_load function is not thread-safe, and it can be called concurrently with the crng_reseed function. This can lead to a race condition where the crng is reseeded before the crng_fast_load function has a chance to finish.
EXPLANATION: The crng_fast_load function is not thread-safe because it does not acquire the spin lock before accessing the input pool. This means that if multiple threads call crng_fast_load at the same time, they may interfere with each other's access to the input pool, leading to a race condition. The crng_reseed function also does not acquire the spin lock before calling crng_fast_load, which makes the situation even worse.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the crng_fast_load function should be made thread-safe by acquiring the spin lock before accessing the input pool. The crng_reseed function should also be modified to acquire the spin lock before calling crng
