VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of a potentially null pointer in a switch statement.
EXPLANATION: The variable'sock' is not initialized before being used in the switch statement. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if'sock' is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Ensure that'sock' is initialized before using it in the switch statement. This could be done by checking if'sock' is null before the switch statement, or by initializing'sock' before the switch statement. For example: if (sock == NULL) return -EINVAL; or sock = get_sock(); before the switch statement.  Also, the variable'sock' should be declared as a pointer to a struct sock, not just a struct sock. The correct declaration should be: struct sock *sock;.  The variable'sk' is declared as a pointer to a struct sock, but it is not used in the switch statement. It should be removed to avoid confusion.  The variable 'ax25' is not used in the code snippet, so it should be removed as well.  The variable 'protocol' is not checked for null before being used in the comparison. It should be
