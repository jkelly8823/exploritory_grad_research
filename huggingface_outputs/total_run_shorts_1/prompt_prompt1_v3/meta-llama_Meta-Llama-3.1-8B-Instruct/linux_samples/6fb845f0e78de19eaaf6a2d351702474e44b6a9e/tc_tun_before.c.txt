VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The memcpy function is used to copy data from the n->primary_key buffer to the e->m_neigh.dst_ip buffer. However, the size of the buffer to be copied is determined by n->tbl->key_len, which may not be a multiple of the size of the data type being copied. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the data type being copied is not a multiple of the size of the data type being copied.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the n->primary_key buffer to the e->m_neigh.dst_ip buffer. The size of the buffer to be copied is determined by n->tbl->key_len. However, the size of the data type being copied is not specified. If the size of the data type being copied is not a multiple of the size of the data type being copied, a buffer overflow can occur. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the data type being copied should be specified. This can
