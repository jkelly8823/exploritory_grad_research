 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a conditional block that checks the value of the `connector_type` variable and, if it matches one of the specified values, calls the `drm_connector_attach_vrr_capable_property` function. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). The use of the `drm_connector_attach_vrr_capable_property` function is also not immediately suspicious.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues and consider using static analysis tools to identify potential problems.  The code could also benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of the conditional block and the function call.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider using a more modern and secure way of handling the connector type, such as using an enum instead of magic numbers.  However, these are just suggestions and not necessarily vulnerabilities.  The code appears to be secure in its current form.  It is also worth noting that the code
