RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues, especially when working with low-level network drivers. Consider using code review tools or static analysis tools to identify potential issues.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger codebase, and the context of the code should be taken into account when reviewing it.  Additionally, the code uses bitwise operations and flags, which can be error-prone if not handled correctly. Consider adding comments or documentation to explain the purpose of each flag and the logic behind the code.  Finally, consider using a code linter or formatter to ensure the code follows a consistent style and is easy to read.  It is also a good practice to test the code thoroughly to
