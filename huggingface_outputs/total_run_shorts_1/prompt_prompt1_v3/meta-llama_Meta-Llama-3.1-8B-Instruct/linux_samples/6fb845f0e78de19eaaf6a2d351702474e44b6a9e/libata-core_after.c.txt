 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable-length string ("Micron_M500IT_*") in a format string.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a format string that includes a variable-length string ("Micron_M500IT_*"). This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is not properly sanitized or if the format string is not properly formatted. This is a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a fixed-length string or to properly sanitize the variable-length string. Additionally, the format string should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly formatted and does not contain any potential security vulnerabilities. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is using a secure method for handling format strings.
