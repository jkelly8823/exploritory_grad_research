VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the down_read and up_read calls. The down_read call acquires the lock, but the up_read call does not release the lock until the end of the function. This allows other threads to access the lists_rwsem lock while it is still held by the current thread, potentially causing a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The down_read and up_read calls are used to protect access to the lists_rwsem lock. However, the up_read call is not paired with a down_read call, which means that the lock is not released until the end of the function. This allows other threads to access the lock while it is still held by the current thread, potentially causing a deadlock.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The up_read call should be paired with a down_read call to ensure that the lock is released before the function returns. This can be done by adding a down_read call before the up_read call, like this: down_read(&lists_rwsem); device = __ib_device_get_by_index(index); if (device) { if (!ib_device_try_get(device)) device = NULL; } down_read(&lists_rwsem); up_read
