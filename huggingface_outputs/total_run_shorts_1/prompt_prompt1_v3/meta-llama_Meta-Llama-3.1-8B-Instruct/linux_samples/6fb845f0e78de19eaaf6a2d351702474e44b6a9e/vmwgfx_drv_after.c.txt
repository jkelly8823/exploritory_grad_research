VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a DMA buffer overflow attack. The `vmw_dma_masks` function sets the DMA mask to 44 bits, but the `vmw_dma_select_mode` function can set the `map_mode` to `vmw_dma_alloc_coherent` which uses 64-bit DMA addresses. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the DMA address space is not properly checked.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `vmw_dma_masks` function sets the DMA mask to 44 bits, but the `vmw_dma_select_mode` function can override this setting by setting the `map_mode` to `vmw_dma_alloc_coherent`. This can lead to a situation where the DMA address space is not properly checked, allowing for a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `vmw_dma_masks` function should be modified to set the DMA mask to 64 bits when the `map_mode` is set to `vmw_dma_alloc_coherent`. Additionally, the `vmw_dma_select_mode` function should be modified to ensure that the `map_mode` is not
