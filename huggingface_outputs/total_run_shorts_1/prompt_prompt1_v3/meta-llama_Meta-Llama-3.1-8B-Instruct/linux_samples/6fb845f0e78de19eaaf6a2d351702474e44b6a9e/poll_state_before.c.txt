VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the loop counter.
EXPLANATION: The loop counter `i` is initialized to 1 and increments until it reaches `drv->state_count`. However, the loop condition is `i < drv->state_count`, which means that `i` will reach `drv->state_count` and potentially cause an integer overflow when `drv->state_count` is large. This could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Change the loop condition to `i <= drv->state_count` to prevent the potential integer overflow. Additionally, consider adding a check to ensure that `drv->state_count` is not too large to prevent the loop from running indefinitely.
