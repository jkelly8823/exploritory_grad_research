VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `%p` format specifier with a pointer to a `struct sk_buff` object.
EXPLANATION: The `%p` format specifier is used to print the address of a pointer. However, the `skb` object is a `struct sk_buff` which contains a pointer to a buffer. If the buffer is large, the address of the pointer will be printed, but the buffer itself will not be printed. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is large enough to overflow the buffer used to store the formatted string. To fix this, the `%p` format specifier should be replaced with `%s` to print the contents of the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the `%p` format specifier with `%s` to print the contents of the buffer. For example: `netdev_dbg(dev, "sent %s, len=%d\n", (char *)desc->skb, desc->skb->len);` Note that this will print the contents of the buffer, not just the address of the pointer. Also, be aware that this may cause issues if the buffer contains null characters
