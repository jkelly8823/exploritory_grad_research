VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of pp_display_cfg->min_dcfclock_khz.
EXPLANATION:
The calculation of pp_display_cfg->min_dcfclock_khz is based on the comparison of context->stream_count with 4. If context->stream_count is greater than 4, it is assigned the value of pp_display_cfg->min_engine_clock_khz. However, if context->stream_count is less than or equal to 4, it is assigned the value 0. This could potentially lead to an integer overflow if context->stream_count is a large number, causing the value of pp_display_cfg->min_dcfclock_khz to wrap around to a very large number.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the comparison should be changed to check for context->stream_count being greater than or equal to 5, and the value of pp_display_cfg->min_engine_clock_khz should be assigned to pp_display_cfg->min_dcfclock_khz in that case. Additionally, the value 0 should be replaced with a more suitable default value, such as pp_display_cfg->min_engine_clock_khz / 2
