VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The spin_unlock_irqrestore() function is called before netif_tx_unlock_bh() which can lead to a situation where the lock is released before the netif_tx_unlock_bh() function is called. This can result in a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The spin_unlock_irqrestore() function is used to release the spinlock that was previously acquired with spin_lock_irqsave(). However, the netif_tx_unlock_bh() function is used to release the netif_tx_lock() that was previously acquired with netif_tx_lock(). The netif_tx_unlock_bh() function is not guaranteed to be called before the spin_unlock_irqrestore() function, which can lead to a deadlock. This is because the netif_tx_unlock_bh() function is called from a different context (softirq) than the spin_unlock_irqrestore() function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the netif_tx_unlock_bh() function should be called before the spin_unlock_irqrestore() function. This can be achieved by swapping the order of these two function calls. Additionally, it is recommended to use a lock that can be safely released from any context
