VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the lack of synchronization between the increment of cpuid and the update of cpuid_to_hartid_map and set_cpu_possible/set_cpu_present.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is iterating over the available CPUs and updating the cpuid_to_hartid_map and set_cpu_possible/set_cpu_present accordingly. However, the increment of cpuid is not atomic, which means that if multiple threads are iterating over the CPUs simultaneously, the cpuid may be incremented multiple times before the update of cpuid_to_hartid_map and set_cpu_possible/set_cpu_present is completed. This can lead to a race condition where the cpuid_to_hartid_map and set_cpu_possible/set_cpu_present are updated with incorrect values.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the increment of cpuid should be made atomic. This can be achieved by using a lock to synchronize access to cpuid. Alternatively, the update of cpuid_to_hartid_map and set_cpu_possible/set_cpu_present can be made atomic by using a lock to synchronize access to these variables. The choice of solution depends on the specific requirements of the
