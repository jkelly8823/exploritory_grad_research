 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a vulnerability due to the repeated call to gpmi_reset_block() with the same parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the function is not properly implemented or if there are side effects from the first call that affect the second call.
EXPLANATION: The function gpmi_reset_block() is called twice with the same parameters, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the function is not properly implemented or if there are side effects from the first call that affect the second call. This is a vulnerability because it can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to remove the duplicate call to gpmi_reset_block(). The corrected code should look like this: 
```c
	/*
	 * Reset BCH here, too. We got failures otherwise :(
	 * See later BCH reset for explanation of MX23 and MX28 handling
	 */
	ret = gpmi_reset_block(r->bch_regs,
			       GPMI_IS_MX23(this) || GPMI_IS_MX28(this));
	if (ret)
		goto err_out;
