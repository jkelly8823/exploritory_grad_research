 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for kernel memory management. It defines constants for the base of unmapped virtual memory, the top of the stack, and the maximum stack size. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is worth noting that the use of magic numbers (e.g. `TASK_SIZE >> 1`) may make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider defining named constants for these values to improve code readability.  | 
```python
def analyze_code(code):
    # Define a list of known vulnerabilities
    vulnerabilities = {
        "SQL Injection": ["SELECT", "FROM", "WHERE"],
        "Cross-Site Scripting": ["<script>", "</script>", "javascript:"],
        "Buffer Overflow": ["strcpy", "strcat", "gets"]
    }

    # Split the code into lines
    lines = code.split("\n")

    # Initialize a flag to track if a vulnerability is found
    vulnerable = False
