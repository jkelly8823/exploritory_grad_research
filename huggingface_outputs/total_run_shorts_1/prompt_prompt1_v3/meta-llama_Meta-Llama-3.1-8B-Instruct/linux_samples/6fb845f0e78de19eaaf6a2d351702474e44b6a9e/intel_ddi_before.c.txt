VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a switch statement fallthrough vulnerability. This occurs when a switch statement does not have a break statement after each case, allowing the code to continue executing after the case has been matched.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement in this code snippet does not have a break statement after each case. This means that if the switch statement matches one of the cases, it will continue executing the code after the case has been matched, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or bugs.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a break statement after each case in the switch statement. This will ensure that the code stops executing after the case has been matched, preventing any potential fallthrough issues. For example: case DPLL_ID_ICL_MGPLL1: break; case DPLL_ID_ICL_MGPLL2: break; case DPLL_ID_ICL_MGPLL3: break;  ```bash
