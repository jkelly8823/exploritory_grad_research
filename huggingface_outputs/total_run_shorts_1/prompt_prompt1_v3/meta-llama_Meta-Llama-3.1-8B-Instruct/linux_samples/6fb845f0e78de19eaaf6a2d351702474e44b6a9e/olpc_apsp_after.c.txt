VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The interrupt is enabled and disabled in a single operation, which can lead to a situation where the interrupt is disabled before it is enabled, resulting in a missed interrupt.
EXPLANATION: The code enables and disables the interrupt in a single operation, which can lead to a race condition. The interrupt is disabled before it is enabled, which can result in a missed interrupt. This can cause the system to miss important events and can lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the interrupt should be enabled and disabled in separate operations. This can be achieved by using a lock to ensure that the interrupt is not disabled while it is being enabled. Alternatively, the interrupt can be disabled before the operation that enables it, and then re-enabled afterwards. This will ensure that the interrupt is not missed and will prevent the race condition.
