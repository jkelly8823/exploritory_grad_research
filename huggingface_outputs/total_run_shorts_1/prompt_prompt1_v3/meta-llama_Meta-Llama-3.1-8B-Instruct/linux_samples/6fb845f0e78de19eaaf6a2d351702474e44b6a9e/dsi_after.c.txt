VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The function dsi_dump_dsi_regs is called after dss_debugfs_remove_file(dsi->debugfs.irqs) and dss_debugfs_remove_file(dsi->debugfs.regs) which removes the debugfs files. However, the function dsi_dump_dsi_regs is still called after these removals, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function dsi_dump_dsi_regs should be called before the debugfs files are removed. The correct order should be: dsi_dump_dsi_regs, dss_debugfs_remove_file(dsi->debugfs.irqs), dss_debugfs_remove_file(dsi->debugfs.regs). This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability.
