VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The mutex lock is released before the irqchip is added to the gpiochip. This can lead to a situation where the irqchip is added to the gpiochip while the lock is still held, causing a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The mutex lock is released before the irqchip is added to the gpiochip. This can lead to a situation where the irqchip is added to the gpiochip while the lock is still held, causing a deadlock. The correct order of operations should be to add the irqchip to the gpiochip while still holding the lock.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The mutex lock should be held until the irqchip is added to the gpiochip. This can be achieved by moving the mutex_unlock call to after the gpiochip_irqchip_add_nested call. The corrected code should look like this: status = gpiochip_irqchip_add_nested(&gpio->chip, &pcf857x_irq_chip, 0, handle_level_irq, IRQ_TYPE_NONE); if (status) { dev_err(&client->dev, "cannot add irqchip\n"); if (status) goto fail; } gpio
