VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists due to the lack of null pointer check before calling of_node_put() function.
EXPLANATION: The of_node_put() function is called without checking if iommu_spec.np is null. If iommu_spec.np is null, this will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a potential crash or security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null pointer check before calling of_node_put() function. For example, you can add a check like this: if (iommu_spec.np!= NULL) of_node_put(iommu_spec.np);. This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure the code is safe.  Additionally, consider using a safer function like of_node_safe_put() which will handle the null pointer case for you.  Also, consider adding a check for fwspec before accessing its members to prevent potential null pointer dereferences.  For example, if (fwspec!= NULL && fwspec->ops!= &mtk_iommu_ops)...  This will prevent potential null pointer dereferences and make the code more robust.  It
