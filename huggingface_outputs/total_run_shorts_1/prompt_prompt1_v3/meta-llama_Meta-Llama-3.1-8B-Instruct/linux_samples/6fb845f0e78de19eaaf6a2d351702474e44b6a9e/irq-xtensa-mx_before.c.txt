VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The cached_irq_mask is being read and written in a non-atomic manner, which can lead to a data race when multiple threads are accessing the same irq.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the use of __this_cpu_read and __this_cpu_write functions, which are not atomic. This means that when multiple threads are accessing the same irq, they may read and write the cached_irq_mask at the same time, leading to a data race. This can cause the mask to be corrupted, resulting in unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should use atomic operations to read and write the cached_irq_mask. This can be achieved by using the atomic_read and atomic_write functions from the linux kernel's atomic.h header file. For example, the following code can be used to replace the non-atomic read and write operations: atomic_t *mask = &cached_irq_mask; mask = atomic_read(mask); mask &= ~mask; atomic_write(mask, mask); This will ensure that the cached_irq_mask is accessed in a thread-safe manner, preventing data races and ensuring the
