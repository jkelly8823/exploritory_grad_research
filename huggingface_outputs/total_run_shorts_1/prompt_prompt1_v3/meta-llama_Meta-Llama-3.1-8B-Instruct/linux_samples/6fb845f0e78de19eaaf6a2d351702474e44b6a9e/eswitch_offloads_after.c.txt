VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the `misc` parameter.
EXPLANATION: The `MLX5_SET_TO_ONES` function is used to set the `misc` parameter to all ones. However, there is no check to ensure that the `misc` parameter is not too large, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the `misc` parameter is within a valid range before passing it to the `MLX5_SET_TO_ONES` function. This can be done by checking the size of the `misc` parameter against the size of the buffer it is being written to.
