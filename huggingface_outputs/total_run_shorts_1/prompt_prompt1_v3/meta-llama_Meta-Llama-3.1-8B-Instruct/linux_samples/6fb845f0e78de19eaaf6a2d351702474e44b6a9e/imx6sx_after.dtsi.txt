 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a device tree binding for a GPT (General-Purpose Timer) peripheral on an i.MX6SX SoC. The code defines a compatible string, register address, interrupt number, and clock sources for the GPT. The syntax and structure of the code are consistent with the device tree binding format.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be a valid and correct implementation of a device tree binding for a GPT peripheral.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. 
```python
def get_user_input():
    user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
    return user_input

def get_user_age():
    user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    return user_age

def main():
    user_name = get_user_input()
    user_age = get_user_age()
    print(f"Hello, {user_name}! You are {user_age} years old.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
