 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The function free_partition(new) is called before the function returns, but the function mtd_add_partition() is exported and can be called from other parts of the code. This means that the partition 'new' may be accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function mtd_add_partition() is exported and can be called from other parts of the code. This means that the partition 'new' may be accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior. The function free_partition(new) is called before the function returns, but the function mtd_add_partition() is exported and can be called from other parts of the code. This means that the partition 'new' may be accessed after it has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function free_partition(new) should be called after the function returns. This can be achieved by moving the call to free_partition(new) to the end of the function, after the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(mtd_add_partition) line. Alternatively, the function mtd_add
