VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the use of a fixed-size array (apmu_mux_clks) to store a variable number of elements.
EXPLANATION: The code defines a fixed-size array (apmu_mux_clks) with a size of 2, but then attempts to store 5 elements in it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, where the extra elements overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the array should be increased to accommodate the maximum number of elements it will store. Alternatively, a dynamic data structure such as a linked list or a vector can be used to store the elements, which would eliminate the risk of buffer overflow. Additionally, it's a good practice to check the bounds of the array before accessing its elements to prevent any potential issues.
