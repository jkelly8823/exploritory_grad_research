VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of irq_set_handler_locked() in a non-atomic manner. This can lead to unexpected behavior when handling interrupts.
EXPLANATION: The function sprd_eic_direction_input() is responsible for setting the direction of a GPIO pin. However, it uses irq_set_handler_locked() to set the interrupt handler, which is not atomic. This means that if multiple interrupts occur simultaneously, the interrupt handler may be set to an incorrect value, leading to unexpected behavior. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use irq_set_handler() instead of irq_set_handler_locked(). This will ensure that the interrupt handler is set in an atomic manner, preventing the possibility of a race condition. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all interrupt handling is done in a thread-safe manner.
