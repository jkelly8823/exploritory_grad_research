VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information leak due to the use of memset to clear the ge structure. This is a problem because memset does not clear the contents of the ge structure, it only clears the memory that the ge structure occupies. This means that any sensitive information that may be stored in the ge structure will still be present after the memset call.
EXPLANATION: The memset function is used to clear the memory occupied by the ge structure. However, memset does not clear the contents of the structure, it only clears the memory. This means that any sensitive information that may be stored in the ge structure will still be present after the memset call. This is a problem because it allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information that should not be accessible.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a function that clears the contents of the ge structure, such as memset with a specific offset, or a function that explicitly clears each member of the structure. For example, the code could use memset to clear the memory occupied by the ge structure, and then use a loop to explicitly clear each member of the structure. This would ensure that all
