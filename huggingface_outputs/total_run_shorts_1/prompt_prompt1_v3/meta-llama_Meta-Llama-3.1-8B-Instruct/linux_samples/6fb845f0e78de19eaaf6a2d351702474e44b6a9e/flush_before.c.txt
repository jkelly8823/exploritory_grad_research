VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a function that handles memory management and cache flushing. It checks if a certain condition is met, and if so, it calls two functions to clean and flush the cache. If the condition is not met, it calls another function to flush the cache for a specific range. The code does not appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues and consider using tools like AddressSanitizer or Valgrind to detect memory-related bugs.  ```bash
