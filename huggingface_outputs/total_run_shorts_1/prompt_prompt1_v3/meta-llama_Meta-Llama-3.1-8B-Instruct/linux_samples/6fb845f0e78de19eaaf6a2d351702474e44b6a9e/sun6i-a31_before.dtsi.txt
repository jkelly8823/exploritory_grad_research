VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the lack of a clock source for the fixed-clock device. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or system crashes.
EXPLANATION: The fixed-clock device requires a clock source to operate correctly. However, in this code snippet, the clock source is not specified. This can cause issues if the device is used in a system where the clock source is not available or is not properly configured.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the clock source should be specified for the fixed-clock device. This can be done by adding a "clock-source" property to the device node, and specifying the correct clock source. For example: "clock-source = <&osc32k>;" would specify the osc32k clock source for the fixed-clock device. Additionally, the clock-frequency property should be verified to ensure it is correct for the specified clock source.  Also, the #clock-cells property should be set to 1 to indicate that the device uses a single clock cell.  The corrected code would look like this: 
			#clock-cells = <1>;
