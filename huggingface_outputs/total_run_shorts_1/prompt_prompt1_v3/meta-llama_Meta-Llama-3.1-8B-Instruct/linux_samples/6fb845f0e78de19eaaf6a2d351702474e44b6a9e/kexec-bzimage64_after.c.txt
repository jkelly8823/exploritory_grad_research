RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include recommended fixes for this code.
```python
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check if ei is NULL before dereferencing it.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This is a classic case of a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is checking if current_ei is NULL before dereferencing it, but it does not do the same for ei. This is a problem because if ei is NULL, the code will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Add a check to ensure that ei is not NULL before dereferencing it.
2. Consider using a safer way to access the efi_info structure, such as using a pointer to a pointer or a reference to a reference.
