VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of a 32-bit unsigned integer to store a 64-bit address.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a 32-bit unsigned integer to store a 64-bit address. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the address is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the integer. This is particularly concerning in the context of the `pr_alert` function, which is used to print the address, as it may cause the function to print incorrect or truncated information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a 64-bit integer type, such as `u64`, to store the address. This can be done by changing the type of the `addr` variable to `u64`. Additionally, the `pr_alert` function should be modified to handle 64-bit addresses correctly. This may involve using a format specifier that can handle 64-bit integers, such as `%llx`.  The `pr_alert` function should also be modified to handle the case where the address is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in a 32-bit integer. This
