VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The variable `srq` is freed in the `err_srqc_alloc` label, but it is still accessed in the `err_idx_buf` label.
EXPLANATION: The `srq` variable is freed in the `err_srqc_alloc` label, which means that any subsequent access to `srq` will result in undefined behavior. In this case, `srq` is accessed in the `err_idx_buf` label, which is after the `err_srqc_alloc` label. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `err_idx_buf` label should be moved above the `err_srqc_alloc` label. This will ensure that `srq` is not freed until after it is no longer accessed. Alternatively, the `err_idx_buf` label can be removed altogether, as it is not necessary for the correct functioning of the code.  Additionally, the `goto` statements should be avoided in favor of more explicit error handling mechanisms.  The `goto` statements make the
