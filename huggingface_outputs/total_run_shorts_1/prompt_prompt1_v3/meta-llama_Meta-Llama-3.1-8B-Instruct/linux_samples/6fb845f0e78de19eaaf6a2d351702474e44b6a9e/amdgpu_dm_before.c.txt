 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that handles DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) mode connector attachment. It checks the type of connector and, if it's either HDMI-A or DisplayPort, it attaches a VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) capable property to the connector. The code seems to be following a logical flow and doesn't contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it's always a good practice to review the code for potential issues, especially when working with sensitive topics like DRM mode. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the conditions under which it's executed.  ```
