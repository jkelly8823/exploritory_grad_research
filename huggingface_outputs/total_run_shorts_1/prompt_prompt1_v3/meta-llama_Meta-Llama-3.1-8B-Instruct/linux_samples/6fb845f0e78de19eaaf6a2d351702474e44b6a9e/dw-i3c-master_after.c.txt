VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked function. The function is not properly synchronized, allowing for the possibility of concurrent access to the xfer->comp completion variable.
EXPLANATION: The dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked function is not protected by a lock, allowing for the possibility of concurrent access to the xfer->comp completion variable. This can lead to a race condition where the completion variable is accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked function should be protected by a lock, such as the master->xferqueue.lock spinlock. This will ensure that only one thread can access and modify the xfer->comp completion variable at a time, preventing the race condition. The corrected function should look like this: static void dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked(struct dw_i3c_master *master, u32 isr) { spin_lock_irqsave(&master->xferqueue.lock, flags); complete(&xfer->comp); spin_unlock_irqrestore(&master->xfer
