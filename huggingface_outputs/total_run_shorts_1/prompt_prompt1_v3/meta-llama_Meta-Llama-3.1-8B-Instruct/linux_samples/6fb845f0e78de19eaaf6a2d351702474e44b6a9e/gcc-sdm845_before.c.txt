VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of fixed-size arrays without bounds checking. The arrays `gcc_parent_names_7` and `gcc_parent_names_8` have a fixed size of 4 and 3 elements respectively, but the code does not check if the number of parent names is within these bounds before accessing the arrays.
EXPLANATION: The code uses fixed-size arrays to store parent names for clock sources. However, the number of parent names is determined by the `num_parents` field in the `clk_init_data` structure. If this field is not correctly set, it can lead to an out-of-bounds access in the parent name arrays, resulting in a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform bounds checking on the parent name arrays before accessing them. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the `num_parents` field is within the bounds of the parent name arrays. Additionally, consider using dynamic arrays or other data structures that can handle variable
