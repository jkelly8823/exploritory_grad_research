VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The mutex is locked, but the ida_alloc_max function is called, which can sleep. This can lead to a deadlock if another thread is waiting for the mutex.
EXPLANATION: The mutex is locked to prevent other threads from accessing the binderfs_minors ida, but the ida_alloc_max function can sleep. If another thread is waiting for the mutex, it will block indefinitely, causing a deadlock.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the ida_alloc_max function should be called before locking the mutex. This will prevent the deadlock. Alternatively, the mutex can be locked for a longer period of time to ensure that the ida_alloc_max function completes before the mutex is unlocked. However, this approach may have performance implications. The best solution would be to use a lock-free ida allocation function.
