VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential null pointer dereference due to lack of error handling for phy_power_on function.
EXPLANATION: The phy_power_on function is called without checking its return value for errors. If phy_power_on fails, it will return a non-zero value, but the code does not handle this case. This could lead to a null pointer dereference when trying to access the bsp_priv pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add error handling for phy_power_on function by checking its return value and handling any potential errors. For example, you could add a check after the phy_power_on function call and return an error code if it fails. ```c
if (ret) {
    // Handle error
    return -EINVAL;
}
