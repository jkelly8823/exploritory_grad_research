VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The function stmmac_tx_avail() is called with a lock held, but the return value is not checked for errors before proceeding. This can lead to a situation where the function returns an incorrect value, causing the code to proceed with an incorrect assumption about the availability of transmit resources.
EXPLANATION: The function stmmac_tx_avail() is called with the lock held, which means that it is guaranteed to return the correct value. However, the return value is not checked for errors before proceeding. This can lead to a situation where the function returns an incorrect value, causing the code to proceed with an incorrect assumption about the availability of transmit resources. This can result in a race condition, where the code attempts to transmit packets when the transmit resources are not available.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The return value of stmmac_tx_avail() should be checked for errors before proceeding. This can be done by adding a check for the return value, and returning an error if it is not successful. For example: if (stmmac_tx_avail(priv, queue) < nfrags + 1) { return NET
