VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of READ_ONCE() macro in the walk_pgd() function. The READ_ONCE() macro is used to ensure that the value of the pgd_t variable is read atomically, but it does not prevent the value from being modified by another thread before it is read. This can lead to a situation where the pgd_t variable is read as a valid value, but the actual value has been modified by another thread, resulting in incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The walk_pgd() function iterates over the pgd_t variables in the pgd_t array, and for each pgd_t variable, it checks if it is valid or not. If it is valid, it calls the walk_pud() function to walk the pud_t variables. However, the pgd_t variable is read using the READ_ONCE() macro, which does not prevent the value from being modified by another thread. This can
