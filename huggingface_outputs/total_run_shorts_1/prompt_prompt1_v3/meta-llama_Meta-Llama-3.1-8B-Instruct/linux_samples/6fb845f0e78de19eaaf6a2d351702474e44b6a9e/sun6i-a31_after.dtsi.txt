VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the lack of a clock source for the osc32k clock. This can lead to undefined behavior or crashes if the clock is used in a critical timing-dependent operation.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines two clock providers, osc24M and osc32k. However, the osc32k clock is not properly configured, as it lacks a clock source. This can cause issues if the osc32k clock is used in a timing-dependent operation, such as in a real-time system. The lack of a clock source can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the clock source for the osc32k clock should be properly configured. This can be done by adding a clock source property to the osc32k clock definition, such as "clock-source = <&osc24M>;" or by defining a separate clock source for the osc32k clock. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code to ensure that the osc32k clock is not used in any timing-dependent operations.  The clock-frequency should also be validated to ensure it is correct for
