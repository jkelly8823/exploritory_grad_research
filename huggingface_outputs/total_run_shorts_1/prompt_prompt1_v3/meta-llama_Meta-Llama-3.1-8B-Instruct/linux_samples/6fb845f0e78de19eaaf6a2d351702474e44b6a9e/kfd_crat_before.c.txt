 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and it does not contain any syntax errors or obvious security vulnerabilities. The function is conditional and only executed if the CONFIG_X86_64 macro is defined.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure.  Please note that this code snippet is incomplete and may not be representative of the entire function. Further analysis of the entire function is recommended.  Additionally, the use of magic numbers and macros should be reviewed to ensure they are properly defined and used.  The use of pointer arithmetic and the lack of bounds checking may also be a concern.  However, based on the provided code snippet, these issues are not immediately apparent.  Further analysis is recommended.  The use of the CONFIG_X86_64 macro is also a concern, as it may not be properly defined or used.  However, this is not a vulnerability in the code itself, but rather a potential issue with the build or configuration of the system.  Further analysis is recommended.  The use of the static keyword may also
