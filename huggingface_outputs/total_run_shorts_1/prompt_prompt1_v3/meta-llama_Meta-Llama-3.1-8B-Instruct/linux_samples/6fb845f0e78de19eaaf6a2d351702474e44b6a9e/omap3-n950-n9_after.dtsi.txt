VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of hardcoded values for timing parameters. These values may not be suitable for all devices or use cases, and could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or system crashes.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains several hardcoded timing values, including gpmc,cs-rd-off-ns, gpmc,cs-wr-off-ns, gpmc,adv-rd-off-ns, gpmc,adv-wr-off-ns, gpmc,oe-off-ns, gpmc,we-off-ns, gpmc,rd-cycle-ns, gpmc,wr-cycle-ns, gpmc,access-ns, gpmc,page-burst-access-ns, gpmc,bus-turnaround-ns, gpmc,cycle2cycle-delay-ns, gpmc,wait-monitoring-ns, gpmc,clk-activation-ns, gpmc,wr-data-mux-bus-ns, and gpmc,wr-access-ns. These values are not dynamically calculated or adjusted based on the
