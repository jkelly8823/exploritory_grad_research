VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential information leak vulnerability exists due to the use of the kvm_read_guest_virt_helper function with an access level of PFERR_USER_MASK. This allows a malicious user to potentially access sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The kvm_read_guest_virt_helper function is used to read guest virtual memory. The access level parameter determines the level of access to the memory. In this case, the access level is set to PFERR_USER_MASK, which allows user-level access. This could potentially allow a malicious user to access sensitive information, such as kernel memory or other privileged data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the access level should be set to a more restrictive level, such as PFERR_KERNEL_MASK, to prevent user-level access. Additionally, the use of the kvm_read_guest_virt_helper function should be reviewed to ensure that it is being used correctly and securely. The function should only be used when necessary, and the access level should be set to the minimum required for the operation.  The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro should be reviewed to ensure that it is being used correctly and that the symbol is not being exported unnecessarily.  The use of
