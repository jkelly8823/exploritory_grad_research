VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a variable-length string in the __asm__ __volatile__ directive.
EXPLANATION: The __asm__ __volatile__ directive is used to execute assembly code, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the string that is being used. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the assembly code, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a fixed-length string in the __asm__ __volatile__ directive, or to use a safer alternative such as __asm__ __volatile__ with a fixed-length string. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that any user-input data is properly sanitized before being used in the assembly code. 

Note: The code is using a variable-length string in the __asm__ __volatile__ directive, which is a common source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The use of a variable-length string in this context is a security risk,
