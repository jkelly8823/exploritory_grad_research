VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of of_property_read_u32() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The of_property_read_u32() function reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from a property in the device tree. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the value being read. If the value is larger than 32 bits, it can cause a buffer overflow, leading to undefined behavior. This can be exploited by an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the value being read does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer. This can be done by checking the value against the maximum value (UINT32_MAX) before storing it in the this_leaf->size or this_leaf->number_of_sets variable. For example: if (value > UINT32_MAX) { /* handle error */ } else { this_leaf->size = value; } or this_leaf->number_of_sets = value; } ``` VULNERABLE: YES VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5 VULNER
