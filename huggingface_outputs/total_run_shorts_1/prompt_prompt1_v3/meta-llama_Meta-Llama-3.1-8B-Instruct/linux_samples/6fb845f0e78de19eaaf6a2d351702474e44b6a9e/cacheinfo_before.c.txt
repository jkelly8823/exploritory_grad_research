VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances where it attempts to access properties from a device tree node (np) without first checking if np is null. If np is null, the code will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add null checks before accessing properties from the device tree node. For example, you can add a check before the if statement in the first code snippet to ensure that np is not null. This can be done by adding the following line of code: if (np == NULL) return; before the if statement. A similar check should be added in the second code snippet. Additionally, consider using a safer way to access properties from the device tree node, such as using the of_property_read_u32() function with a default value. This will prevent the code from crashing in case the property is not found. For example: of_property_read_u32(np, propname, &this_leaf->size, 0);. This will set the size to 0 if the
