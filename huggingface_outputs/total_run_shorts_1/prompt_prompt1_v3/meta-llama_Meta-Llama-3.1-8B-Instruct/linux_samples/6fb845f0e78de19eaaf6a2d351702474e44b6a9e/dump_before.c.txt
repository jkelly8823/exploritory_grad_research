VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of READ_ONCE() macro in the walk_pmd(), walk_pud(), and walk_pgd() functions. The READ_ONCE() macro is used to ensure that the pmd, pud, and pgd values are read atomically, but it does not prevent the pmd, pud, and pgd values from being modified by another thread between the time they are read and the time they are used.
EXPLANATION: The walk_pmd(), walk_pud(), and walk_pgd() functions use the READ_ONCE() macro to read the pmd, pud, and pgd values atomically. However, the pmd, pud, and pgd values are not protected from being modified by another thread between the time they are read and the time they are used. This can lead to a race condition where the pmd, pud, and pgd values are modified by another thread before they are used
