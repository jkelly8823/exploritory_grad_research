VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size array to store parent names, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of parent names exceeds the array size.
EXPLANATION: The code defines several arrays to store parent names for different clock sources. However, the size of these arrays is fixed and hardcoded, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of parent names exceeds the array size. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the parent name arrays should be dynamically allocated based on the actual number of parent names. This can be achieved by using a data structure such as a linked list or a dynamically allocated array. Additionally, input validation should be performed to ensure that the number of parent names does not exceed the allocated size.
