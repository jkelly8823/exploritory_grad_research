 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the blk_flush_complete_seq and blk_mq_sched_restart functions. The spin_unlock_irqrestore function is called before blk_mq_sched_restart, which can lead to a race condition if another thread is trying to access the fq->mq_flush_lock at the same time.
EXPLANATION: The spin_unlock_irqrestore function is used to release the lock on the fq->mq_flush_lock. However, the blk_mq_sched_restart function is called immediately after, which can lead to a race condition if another thread is trying to access the fq->mq_flush_lock at the same time. This is because the lock is not guaranteed to be released before the blk_mq_sched_restart function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the spin_unlock_irqrestore function should be called after the blk_mq_sched_restart function. This will ensure that the lock is released before the blk_mq_sched_restart function is called, preventing the race condition. Alternatively, the lock can be held for a longer period of time to prevent other threads from accessing the fq->mq_flush_lock while the blk_mq_sched_restart function is being called.
