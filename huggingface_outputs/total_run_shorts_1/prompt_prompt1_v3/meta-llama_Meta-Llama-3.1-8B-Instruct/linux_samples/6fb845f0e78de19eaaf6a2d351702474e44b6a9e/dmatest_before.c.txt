VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where dma_submit_error returns true, but the dma_async_issue_pending function is called before checking the status of the DMA transaction. This can lead to a situation where the DMA transaction is still pending when the code attempts to unmap the DMA buffer, resulting in a use-after-free error.
EXPLANATION: The code checks the status of the DMA transaction after calling dma_async_issue_pending, but it does not check the status of the DMA transaction before calling dma_async_issue_pending. This means that if dma_submit_error returns true, the code will attempt to unmap the DMA buffer before the DMA transaction has completed, resulting in a use-after-free error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check the status of the DMA transaction before calling dma_async_issue_pending. This can be done by adding a check for dma_submit_error before calling dma_async_issue_pending. If dma_submit_error returns true, the code should not call dma_async_issue_pending and instead handle the error accordingly.
