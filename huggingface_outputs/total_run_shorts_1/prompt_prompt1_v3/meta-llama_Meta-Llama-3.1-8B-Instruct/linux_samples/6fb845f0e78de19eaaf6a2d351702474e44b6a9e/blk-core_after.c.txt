 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the timer_setup calls for the laptop_mode_wb_timer and the timeout timer. The laptop_mode_wb_timer timer function is not provided, but the timeout timer function is. This means that the laptop_mode_wb_timer timer function may be accessing the q->backing_dev_info structure while the timeout timer function is accessing the q->timeout structure, potentially causing a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The timer_setup function is used to set up a timer that will call a specific function when it expires. In this case, the laptop_mode_wb_timer and timeout timers are being set up to call different functions. However, the laptop_mode_wb_timer function is not provided, which means that its behavior is unknown. If the laptop_mode_wb_timer function is accessing the q->backing_dev_info structure while the timeout timer function is accessing the q->timeout structure, a race condition could occur. This is because the q->backing_dev_info and q->timeout structures are likely to be accessed concurrently by the two timer functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the laptop_mode_wb_timer timer function should be
