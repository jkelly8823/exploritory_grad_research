VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A static variable is being assigned a value from a non-static context.
EXPLANATION: The static variable mmp2_conf is being assigned a value from the non-static context of the function mmp_handle_irq. This is a vulnerability because it can lead to unexpected behavior when the function is called multiple times, as the static variable will retain its value from the previous call.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Move the assignment of mmp2_conf to a static initialization block, or make mmp2_conf a non-static variable. This will ensure that mmp2_conf is properly initialized and does not retain values from previous function calls. 

Note: The vulnerability is not in the code snippet itself, but rather in the fact that the static variable is being assigned a value from a non-static context. The code snippet is missing the initialization of mmp2_conf, which is likely done elsewhere in the code. However, the vulnerability is still present because the assignment of mmp2_conf is not properly guarded. 

Also, note that the vulnerability is not a typical buffer overflow or SQL injection, but rather a more subtle issue related to the use of static variables.
