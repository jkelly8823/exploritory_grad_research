VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of irq_set_handler_locked() in a non-atomic context.
EXPLANATION: The function sprd_eic_direction_input() is modifying the interrupt handler for a GPIO pin while holding a lock, but it is not guaranteed that the lock will be held for the duration of the interrupt handler setup. This can lead to a race condition where the interrupt handler is set before the lock is released, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the lock is held for the duration of the interrupt handler setup. This can be achieved by using a spinlock or a mutex to protect the critical section. For example, the code could use a spinlock to protect the interrupt handler setup, like this: spin_lock(&chip->lock); irq_set_handler_locked(data, handle_edge_irq); spin_unlock(&chip->lock);. This will ensure that the lock is held for the duration of the interrupt handler setup, preventing the race condition.
