VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked function. The function is called with the lock held, but it calls dw_i3c_master_dequeue_xfer which unlocks the lock and then relocks it. This allows other threads to access the xfer->comp completion variable while it is being accessed by the current thread.
EXPLANATION: The dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked function is called with the lock held, which is good for preventing other threads from accessing the xfer->comp completion variable. However, it then calls dw_i3c_master_dequeue_xfer which unlocks the lock and then relocks it. This allows other threads to access the xfer->comp completion variable while it is being accessed by the current thread, creating a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the dw_i3c_master_end_xfer_locked function should not call dw_i3c_master_dequeue_xfer. Instead, it should handle the completion of the transfer itself. This can be done by checking the status of the transfer and completing the transfer if it was successful. If the transfer was not
