VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential race condition exists due to the lack of synchronization between the zap_pte_range function and the split_huge_page_pmd function.
EXPLANATION: The zap_pte_range function modifies the pte table, while the split_huge_page_pmd function also modifies the pte table. However, the split_huge_page_pmd function is not protected by a lock, which means that it can be executed concurrently with the zap_pte_range function. This can lead to a race condition where the pte table is modified by both functions simultaneously, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the split_huge_page_pmd function should be protected by a lock, such as the tlb->mm->mmap_sem lock, to ensure that it is executed exclusively. Additionally, the zap_pte_range function should be modified to check if the split_huge_page_pmd function has already been executed before modifying the pte table. This can be done by adding a flag to indicate whether the split_huge_page_pmd function has been executed, and checking this flag before modifying the pte table.  The zap
