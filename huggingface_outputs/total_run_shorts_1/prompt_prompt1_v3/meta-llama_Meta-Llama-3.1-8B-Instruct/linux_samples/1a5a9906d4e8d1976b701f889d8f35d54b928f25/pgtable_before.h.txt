RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues, especially in critical kernel modules.  The code could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of each function and the logic behind the conditional compilation directives. This would improve code readability and maintainability.  Additionally, the use of static inline functions can be beneficial for performance, but it may also lead to code bloat if not used judiciously. A careful review of the code's impact on the overall system's performance is recommended.  Finally, the code could benefit from additional testing to ensure that it functions correctly in various scenarios.  This would involve writing unit tests and integration tests to validate the code's behavior.  This would help to catch any potential issues early
