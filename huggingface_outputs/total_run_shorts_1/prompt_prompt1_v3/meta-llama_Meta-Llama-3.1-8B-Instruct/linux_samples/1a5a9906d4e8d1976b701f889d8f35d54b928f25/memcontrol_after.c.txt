VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The spinlock is not properly released in the event of an exception or return. This can cause a deadlock or other issues.
EXPLANATION: The spinlock is acquired in the pte_offset_map_lock function, but it is not released in the event of an exception or return. This can cause a deadlock or other issues. The spinlock is also not properly released in the retry loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The spinlock should be released in the event of an exception or return. This can be done by using a try/finally block to ensure the spinlock is released. The retry loop should also be modified to properly release the spinlock. For example: spin_lock(ptl); try {... } finally { spin_unlock(ptl); } and in the retry loop: spin_lock(ptl); try {... } finally { spin_unlock(ptl); } spin_lock(ptl); try {... } finally { spin_unlock(ptl); } spin_unlock(ptl);. 

Note: The spinlock is not properly released in the retry loop. The spinlock is released after the second iteration
