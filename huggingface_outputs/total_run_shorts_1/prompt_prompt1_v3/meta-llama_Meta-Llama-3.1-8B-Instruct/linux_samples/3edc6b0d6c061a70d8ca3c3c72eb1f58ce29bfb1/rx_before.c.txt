VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the BUILD_BUG_ON macro without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The BUILD_BUG_ON macro is used to assert that IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN is equal to IEEE80211_GCMP_PN_LEN. However, this assertion is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow vulnerability. If the lengths are not equal, the code will still attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the pn array, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include proper bounds checking before accessing the pn array. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the lengths are equal before accessing the array. For example: if (IEEE80211_CCMP_PN_LEN == IEEE80211_GCMP_PN_LEN) {... } else {... } This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability and ensure that the code is safe to execute.  Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to BUILD_BUG_ON, such as a runtime check, to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  Also, consider using a safer alternative
