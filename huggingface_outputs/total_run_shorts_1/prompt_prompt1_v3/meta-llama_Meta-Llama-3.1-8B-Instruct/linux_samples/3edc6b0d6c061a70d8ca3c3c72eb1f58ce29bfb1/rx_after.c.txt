VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The skb_pull function is called with a variable (ieee80211_hdrlen(fc)) that is not checked for its maximum value. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of ieee80211_hdrlen(fc) is larger than the size of the skb buffer.
EXPLANATION: The skb_pull function is used to remove the header from the skb buffer. However, the function is called with a variable (ieee80211_hdrlen(fc)) that is not checked for its maximum value. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of ieee80211_hdrlen(fc) is larger than the size of the skb buffer. The skb_pull function does not perform any bounds checking on the length parameter, so it is possible for the function to remove more data from the skb buffer than is available, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the value of ieee80211_hdrlen(fc) before calling skb_pull. This can be done by adding a simple bounds check to ensure that the value of ieee80211_hd
