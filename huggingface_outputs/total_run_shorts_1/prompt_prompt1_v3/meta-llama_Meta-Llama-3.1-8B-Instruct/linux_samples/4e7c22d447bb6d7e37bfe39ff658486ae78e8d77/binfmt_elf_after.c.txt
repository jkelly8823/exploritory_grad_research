VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of the `get_random_int()` function, which can potentially return a value that is too large to fit within the stack.
EXPLANATION: The `get_random_int()` function can return a value that is too large to fit within the stack, causing a buffer overflow. This is because the `STACK_RND_MASK` is used to mask the random value, but it does not guarantee that the resulting value will be within the bounds of the stack. Additionally, the `PAGE_SHIFT` is used to shift the random value to the left, which can further increase the value, making it more likely to cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to generate a random value, such as using the `get_random_bytes()` function, which returns a random value that is guaranteed to be within the bounds of the stack. Alternatively, the code can use a smaller mask to limit the range of the random value. Additionally, the code should check the value of `random_variable` to ensure that it is within the bounds of the
