VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to the use of a large stack size.
EXPLANATION: The code calculates the maximum stack size by shifting the value -1 left by PAGE_SHIFT bits and then applying a mask. This results in a large stack size that can potentially lead to a stack overflow. The use of a large stack size can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a smaller stack size or implement a more secure method of stack size calculation. One possible solution is to use a fixed stack size or to use a random number generator to generate a stack size within a safe range. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other types of attacks.  The use of a large stack size can be mitigated by using a stack guard page, which can detect and prevent stack overflows.  The stack guard page can be implemented by adding a guard page at the top of the stack and checking for overflows.  This can be done by using the `mprotect` system call to set the guard page
