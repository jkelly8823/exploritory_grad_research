VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to the use of a large stack size.
EXPLANATION: The code calculates the maximum stack size by shifting the value -1 by the PAGE_SHIFT value, which is likely 12 or 20. This results in a large stack size that can lead to a stack overflow. The use of the bitwise AND operator (&) with STACK_RND_MASK is also suspicious, as it may be used to mask the high bits of the stack size, potentially leading to an overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a smaller stack size or implement a more robust stack size calculation. The use of the bitwise AND operator (&) with STACK_RND_MASK should be reviewed and potentially replaced with a safer alternative. Additionally, the code should consider using a stack size that is a power of 2 to avoid potential issues with alignment.  The code should also consider using a stack size that is a multiple of the page size to avoid potential issues with fragmentation.  The code should also consider using a stack size that is a multiple of the stack size of the previous stack frame to avoid potential issues with
