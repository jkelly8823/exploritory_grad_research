 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability related to the handling of privileged processes in debug mode. Specifically, it allows regular users to examine the memory contents of privileged processes, which is insecure.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet describes the behavior of the system in different modes, including debug mode. In debug mode, all processes dump core when possible, and the core dump is owned by the current user and no security is applied. This allows regular users to examine the memory contents of privileged processes, which is a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the system should be configured to apply security restrictions to core dumps in debug mode. This can be achieved by setting the "core_pattern" kernel sysctl to a pipe handler or a fully qualified path, or by using a core dump pipe handler that knows to treat privileged core dumps with care. Additionally, the system should be configured to log warnings to syslog when a core dump happens without a pipe handler or fully qualified path. This will help administrators to detect and address potential security issues.  ### 
```python
def get_core_dump_mode():
    # Return the core dump mode based on the system configuration
