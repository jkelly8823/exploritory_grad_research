VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing bounds checking on the 'pdu' variable.
EXPLANATION: The'memset' function is used to clear the 'pdu' variable, but the size of the 'pdu' variable is not validated. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the 'pdu' variable is larger than the allocated memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate the size of the 'pdu' variable before clearing it with'memset'. Use a function like'sizeof' to get the size of the 'pdu' variable and pass it as an argument to'memset'. For example: memset(&pdu, 0, sizeof(pdu)); should be replaced with: memset(&pdu, 0, sizeof(struct pdu)); where'struct pdu' is the actual type of the 'pdu' variable. Alternatively, use a safer function like 'bzero' which is designed to handle buffer overflows.  Also, the'memset' function is not necessary here, as the 'pdu' variable is already initialized with zeros. The'memset' function can be removed.
