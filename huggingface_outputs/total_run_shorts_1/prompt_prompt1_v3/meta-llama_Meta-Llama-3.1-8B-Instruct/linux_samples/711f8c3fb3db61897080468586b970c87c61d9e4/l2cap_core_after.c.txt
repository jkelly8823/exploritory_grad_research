VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `psm` variable. The `psm` variable is used to index into an array or structure, but its value is not validated to ensure it falls within a valid range. This allows an attacker to potentially access or modify arbitrary memory locations, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances of the `psm` variable being used without proper bounds checking. In the first instance, the `psm` variable is used to index into a structure or array, but its value is not validated to ensure it falls within a valid range. In the second instance, the `psm` variable is used to access a global channel by PSM, but again, its value is not validated. This lack of bounds checking makes the code vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include proper bounds checking on the `psm` variable. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the `psm` variable falls within
