VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when accessing the str array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to access the str array at index size-1 without checking if size is within the valid range. This can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the array, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that size is within the valid range before accessing the str array. For example, you can add a check to ensure that size is greater than 0 before accessing str[size-1]. Additionally, consider using a safer method to remove the newline character, such as using a loop to find the last non-newline character. ```c
if (size > 0 && str[size-1] == '\n') {
    str[size-1] = 0;
    size--;
}
``` ```c
if (size > 0 && str[size-1] == '\n') {
    str[size-1] = 0;
    size--;
}
``` ```c
if (size > 0 && str[size-1] ==
