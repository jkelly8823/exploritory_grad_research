VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a case statement without a default case, which can lead to undefined behavior if the input value does not match any of the specified cases.
EXPLANATION: The case statement in the code snippet is used to handle different input values. However, it does not have a default case, which means that if the input value does not match any of the specified cases, the code will continue executing from the end of the switch statement, potentially leading to undefined behavior. This can happen if the input value is not one of the expected values (KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING, KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT, KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING).
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, a default case should be added to the switch statement to handle unexpected input values. For example, the default case can return an error code or log an error message to indicate that an unexpected input value was received. The updated code should look like this: ```c case KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING: ret = install_process_keyring_to_cred(new); if (ret < 0) { if (ret!= -E
