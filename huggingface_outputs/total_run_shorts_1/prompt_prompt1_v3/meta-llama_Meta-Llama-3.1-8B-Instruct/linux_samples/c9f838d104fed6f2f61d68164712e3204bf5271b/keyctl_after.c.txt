VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a case statement without a default case, which can lead to undefined behavior if the input value does not match any of the specified cases.
EXPLANATION: The case statement in the code snippet is used to handle different input values. However, it does not have a default case, which means that if the input value does not match any of the specified cases, the code will continue executing beyond the end of the switch statement, potentially leading to undefined behavior. This can happen if the input value is not one of the specified cases, or if the cases are not exhaustive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, a default case should be added to the switch statement to handle any unexpected input values. This can be done by adding a default label at the end of the switch statement, and then using a goto statement to jump to the error handling code. Alternatively, the switch statement can be replaced with a series of if-else statements to handle each possible input value explicitly. 

Note: The code snippet seems to be incomplete, as it appears to be a fragment of a larger function. However, the vulnerability is still present in
