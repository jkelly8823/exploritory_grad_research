VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the xen_timer_interrupt function. The function checks if the irq is greater than or equal to 0, but it does not account for the possibility of another CPU accessing the shared per_cpu variable xen_clock_events before the check is completed. This can lead to a situation where the irq is unbound and then immediately rebound, causing unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The xen_timer_interrupt function is designed to handle the unbinding of the irq when the timer is disabled. However, the function does not account for the possibility of another CPU accessing the shared per_cpu variable xen_clock_events before the check is completed. This can lead to a situation where the irq is unbound and then immediately rebound, causing unexpected behavior. The use of the per_cpu variable creates a shared resource that can be accessed by multiple CPUs, which increases the likelihood of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the xen_timer_interrupt function should be modified to use a lock to protect access to the shared per_cpu variable xen_clock_events. This will ensure that only one CPU can access the variable at a time, preventing the race condition. Additionally, the
