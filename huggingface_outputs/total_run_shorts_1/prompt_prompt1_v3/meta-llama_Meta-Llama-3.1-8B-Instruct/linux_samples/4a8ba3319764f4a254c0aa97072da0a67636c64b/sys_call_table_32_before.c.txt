VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The sys_call_table array is declared with a cacheline alignment attribute, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the array is not properly initialized or if the compiler fails to align the array correctly.
EXPLANATION: The cacheline alignment attribute is used to optimize the performance of the array by aligning it to a cacheline boundary. However, this attribute can also lead to a buffer overflow if the array is not properly initialized or if the compiler fails to align the array correctly. This can happen if the array is not initialized with a valid value, or if the compiler fails to align the array to the specified boundary, resulting in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the cacheline alignment attribute should be removed, and the array should be properly initialized with a valid value. Additionally, the compiler should be checked to ensure that it is correctly aligning the array to the specified boundary. If the compiler is not correctly aligning the array, the cacheline alignment attribute should be removed, and the array should be properly initialized with a valid value.  The code should also be
