VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential format string vulnerability due to a missing format specifier for the 'irqs' parameter.
EXPLANATION: The dev_info function is being used with a format string that includes a %s for the 'irqs' parameter. However, the 'irqs' parameter is a string that is not guaranteed to be null-terminated, which could lead to a format string vulnerability if the string is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the %s format specifier with caution and ensure that the 'irqs' parameter is properly sanitized to prevent potential format string vulnerabilities. Consider using the %p format specifier instead, which is safer for printing pointers. Alternatively, use a safer function like dev_info_ratelimited or dev_dbg to print the information.  Also, consider using a safer way to print the 'irqs' parameter, such as using a format string that does not include the %s specifier. For example: dev_info(&ofdev->dev, "irqs=%s\n", irq_str); where irq_str is a properly sanitized string.  If the 'irqs' parameter is a pointer, consider using the %p format specifier instead
