VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a hardcoded address (0xd000) in the sysctrl node. This could lead to issues if the address changes or if the code is ported to a different platform.
EXPLANATION: The use of hardcoded addresses can make the code less portable and more prone to errors. In this case, the address 0xd000 is used in the sysctrl node, which could potentially cause issues if the address changes or if the code is ported to a different platform.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the address should be replaced with a more dynamic method of determining the address, such as using a device tree binding or a kernel-provided function. This would make the code more portable and less prone to errors. For example, the address could be replaced with a property like "reg" or "base-address" that is defined in the device tree binding. This would allow the kernel to determine the correct address at runtime.
