VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the decompress function call. The decompress function is called with a pointer to the output buffer, but the buffer size is not checked. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The decompress function is called with a pointer to the output buffer, but the buffer size is not checked. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. The buffer overflow vulnerability is a classic example of a buffer overflow attack, where an attacker can write data past the end of a buffer, potentially executing arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the buffer size should be checked before calling the decompress function. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the output buffer size is greater than or equal to the input data size. Additionally, the decompress function should be modified to handle buffer overflows by checking the buffer size before writing to it. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the buffer size is greater than or equal to the amount of data being written. Finally, the output buffer should be initialized to zero before calling the
