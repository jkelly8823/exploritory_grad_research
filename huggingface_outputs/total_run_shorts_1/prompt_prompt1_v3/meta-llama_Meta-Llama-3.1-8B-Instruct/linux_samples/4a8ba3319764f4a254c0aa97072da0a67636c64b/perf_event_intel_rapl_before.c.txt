VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer in the rapl_pmu struct.
EXPLANATION: The rapl_pmu struct contains a fixed-size buffer for the.attrs field, which is assigned the rapl_pmu_attrs value. However, the rapl_pmu_attrs value is not checked for its size before being assigned to the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if the value is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the.attrs field in the rapl_pmu struct should be dynamically allocated based on the size of the rapl_pmu_attrs value. Alternatively, the rapl_pmu_attrs value should be checked for its size before being assigned to the buffer to prevent buffer overflow. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array or a linked list, to store the attributes.
