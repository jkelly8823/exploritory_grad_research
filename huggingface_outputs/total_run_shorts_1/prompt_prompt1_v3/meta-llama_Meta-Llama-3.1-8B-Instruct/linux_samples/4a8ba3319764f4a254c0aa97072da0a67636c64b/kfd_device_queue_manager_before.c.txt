VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The mutex lock is acquired, but the function returns early without releasing the lock, potentially causing a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The function `destroy_queue_nocpsch` acquires a mutex lock at the beginning of the function, but then returns early with an error code without releasing the lock. This can cause a deadlock if another thread is waiting for the lock to be released.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function should be modified to release the mutex lock before returning early. This can be done by adding a `mutex_unlock(&dqm->lock);` statement before the `return -ENOMEM;` statement. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that all possible error paths release the lock.
