VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of hardcoded strings for the maximum speed and data role mode. This can lead to issues if the device is used in different environments or configurations.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be a device tree overlay for a USB controller. The use of hardcoded strings for the maximum speed and data role mode can cause problems if the device is used in different environments or configurations. For example, if the device is used in a high-speed environment, but the hardcoded string is set to "super-speed", it can cause issues. Similarly, if the device is used in an OTG mode, but the hardcoded string is set to "host", it can cause issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded strings should be replaced with variables or configuration options that can be set dynamically based on the environment or configuration. This can be achieved by using a configuration file or a runtime configuration mechanism. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all hardcoded strings are replaced and that the device can operate correctly in different environments and configurations.  The use of hardcoded strings can be
