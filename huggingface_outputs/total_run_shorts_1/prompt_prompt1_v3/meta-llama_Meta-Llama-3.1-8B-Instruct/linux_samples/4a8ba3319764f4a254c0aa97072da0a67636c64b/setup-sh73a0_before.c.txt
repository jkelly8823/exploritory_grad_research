VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 7, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size array (irqpin0_resources, irqpin2_resources, irqpin3_resources) to store memory addresses. An attacker could potentially overflow the array by providing a large number of memory addresses, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code defines three arrays (irqpin0_resources, irqpin2_resources, irqpin3_resources) to store memory addresses. However, the size of these arrays is fixed and not dynamically allocated. An attacker could potentially overflow these arrays by providing a large number of memory addresses, leading to a buffer overflow. This could result in arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should dynamically allocate the size of the arrays based on the number of memory addresses provided. This can be achieved by using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized data. Additionally, the code should validate the input memory addresses to prevent buffer overflow attacks. The code should also consider using a safer data structure, such as a linked list or a hash table, to
