VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the mixer_wait_for_vblank function. The mutex is unlocked before the vblank counter is acquired, allowing another thread to access the mixer context while it is being modified.
EXPLANATION: The mutex is locked at the beginning of the function, but it is unlocked before the vblank counter is acquired. This allows another thread to access the mixer context while the vblank counter is being acquired, potentially causing a race condition. This is a problem because the mixer context is being modified while it is being accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the mutex should be locked again before acquiring the vblank counter. This can be done by moving the mutex_lock call to before the drm_vblank_get call. Additionally, the mutex should be unlocked after the vblank counter is acquired to prevent deadlocks. The corrected code would look like this: mutex_lock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex); err = drm_vblank_get(mgr->crtc->dev, mixer_ctx->pipe); mutex_unlock(&mixer_ctx->mixer_mutex);.
