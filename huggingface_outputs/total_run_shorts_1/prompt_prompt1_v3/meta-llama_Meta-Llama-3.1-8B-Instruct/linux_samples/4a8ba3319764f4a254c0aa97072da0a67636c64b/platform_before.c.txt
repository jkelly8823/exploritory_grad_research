 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The function dw_dma_probe() is called before the function of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node) is called. This could lead to a situation where the of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node) function is called on a freed resource.
EXPLANATION: The function of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node) is called after the function dw_dma_remove(chip) is called. However, the function dw_dma_remove(chip) calls clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk) which could potentially free the resource that of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node) is trying to free. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node) should be called before the function dw_dma_remove(chip) is called. This will ensure that the resource is not freed before it is used. The corrected code should look like this: of_dma_controller_free(pdev->dev.of_node); dw_dma_remove(chip); clk_disable_unprepare(chip->clk); return 0; . This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability. .
