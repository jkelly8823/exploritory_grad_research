VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate PCI device entries can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains duplicate entries for PCI devices with the same vendor ID and device ID. This can cause issues with device detection and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. The duplicate entries are on lines 4 and 5.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the duplicate entries to ensure accurate device detection and prevent potential security vulnerabilities. The corrected code should only include unique PCI device entries. For example, the corrected code could be: { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa103), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H AHCI */.  { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa105), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */.  { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa107), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */.  { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0xa10f), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-H RAID */.  { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, 0x9d05), board_ahci }, /* Sunrise Point-LP RAID */.  {
