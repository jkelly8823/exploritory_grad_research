VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The `madt` pointer is not checked for null before it is dereferenced in the line `if (ACPI_FAILURE(acpi_get_table(ACPI_SIG_MADT, 0, (struct acpi_table_header **)&madt)))`. If `acpi_get_table` fails and returns an error, the `madt` pointer will be null, and the subsequent dereference in the line `madt->header.length` will result in a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is part of the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) driver in the Linux kernel. The `madt` pointer is used to point to the MADT (Multiple APIC Description Table) table, which contains information about the local APICs (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers) in the system. The `acpi_get_table` function is used to retrieve the MADT table from the ACPI namespace. If `acpi_get_table` fails and returns an error, the `madt` pointer will be null, and the subsequent dereference will result in
