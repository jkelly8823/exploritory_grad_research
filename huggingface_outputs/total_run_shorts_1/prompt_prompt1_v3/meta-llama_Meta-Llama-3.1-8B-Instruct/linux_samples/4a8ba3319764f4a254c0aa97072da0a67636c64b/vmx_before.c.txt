VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential data corruption issue due to the use of memset with a large value (0xff) to clear a large memory region (PAGE_SIZE). This can lead to a situation where the memory region is not properly cleared, potentially causing data corruption or other issues.
EXPLANATION: The memset function is used to clear a large memory region (PAGE_SIZE) with a value of 0xff. This can lead to a situation where the memory region is not properly cleared, potentially causing data corruption or other issues. This is because memset does not guarantee that the entire memory region will be cleared, especially when dealing with large memory regions. This can be particularly problematic in a virtualization environment where data corruption can have significant consequences.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should use a more reliable method to clear the memory region, such as using a loop to clear each byte individually. Alternatively, the code can use a function like memset_s or securec to clear the memory region in a secure manner. Additionally, the code should consider using a more robust memory clearing method, such as using a memory clearing library or
