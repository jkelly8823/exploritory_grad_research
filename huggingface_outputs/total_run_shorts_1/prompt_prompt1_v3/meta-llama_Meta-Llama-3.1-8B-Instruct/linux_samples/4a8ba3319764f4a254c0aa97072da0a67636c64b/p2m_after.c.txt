VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The function free_p2m_page() is called with a pointer to a page that may have already been freed.
EXPLANATION: The function free_p2m_page() takes a pointer to a page as an argument. However, the pointer to the page may have already been freed by the time free_p2m_page() is called. This is because the function free_bootmem() is called in the unlikely case that slab_is_available() returns false. If slab_is_available() returns false, the page is freed using free_bootmem(), and then free_p2m_page() is called with the freed page pointer. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function free_p2m_page() should be modified to check if the page pointer has already been freed before attempting to free it. This can be done by checking if the page pointer is NULL before calling free_page(). If the page pointer is NULL, the function should return immediately without attempting to free the page. Additionally, the function free_bootmem() should be modified to set the
