VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a double free vulnerability. The function `amd_iommu_free_device` is called twice in the error handling path, which can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two error handling paths: one for `device_iommu_pasid_init` failure and another for `kfd->init_complete` failure. In both paths, `amd_iommu_free_device` is called, which frees the device's IOMMU resources. However, in the `device_iommu_pasid_init` failure path, `amd_iommu_free_device` is called again in the `device_queue_manager_error` label. This is incorrect, as the device's IOMMU resources have already been freed. This can lead to a double free vulnerability, which can cause undefined behavior and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that `amd_iommu_free_device` is only called once in the error handling path. This can be achieved by removing the second call to `amd_iommu_free_device` in the `device
