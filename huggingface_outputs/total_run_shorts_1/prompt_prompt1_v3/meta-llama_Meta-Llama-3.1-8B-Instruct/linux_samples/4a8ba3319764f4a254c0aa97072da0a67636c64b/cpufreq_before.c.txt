VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If policy->governor is null, then policy->governor->max_transition_latency will result in a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if policy->governor->max_transition_latency is not null before accessing it. However, it does not check if policy->governor is null before accessing policy->governor->max_transition_latency. This is a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a null check for policy->governor before accessing policy->governor->max_transition_latency. The corrected code should look like this: if (policy->governor && policy->governor->max_transition_latency && policy->cpuinfo.transition_latency > policy->governor->max_transition_latency) {... } This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure that the code runs safely.  The null check should be added before the if statement.  The corrected code should look like this: if (policy->governor && policy->governor->max_transition_latency) {
