VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly check the return value of pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() which can lead to a resource leak if the function fails to acquire or release the runtime PM.
EXPLANATION: The pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() functions are used to acquire and release the runtime PM for the device. However, the code does not check the return value of these functions, which can lead to a resource leak if the function fails to acquire or release the runtime PM. This can cause issues such as device hang or crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() and handle the error accordingly. For example, if pm_runtime_get_sync() fails, the code should return an error code. If pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() fails, the code should not return and handle the error properly. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
int ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(chip->dev);
if (ret < 0) {
    // handle error
    return ret;
}

// rest of the code

ret
