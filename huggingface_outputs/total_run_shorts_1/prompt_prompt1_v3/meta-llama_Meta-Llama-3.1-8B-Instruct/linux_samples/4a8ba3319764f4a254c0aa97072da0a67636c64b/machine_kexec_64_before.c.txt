VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a kexec system call, which is used to boot a new kernel. The code checks if the crashing CPU is set to -1, and if so, it prepares the CPUs for kexec. The rest of the code is a debug message indicating the start of the switchover sequence. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were detected. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and consider using static analysis tools to identify potential problems.  The code could also benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of the kexec_prepare_cpus() function and the significance of the crashing_cpu variable.  Additionally, the use of pr_debug() could be replaced with a more robust logging mechanism to handle different log levels.  However, these are minor suggestions and do not affect the security of the code.  The code appears to be secure and well
