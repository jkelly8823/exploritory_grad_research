VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a device tree blob (DTB) file, which is used to describe the hardware components of a Linux system. The code snippet defines a device node for an SDHCI controller, specifically the sdhci2 node. The non-removable property is set to indicate that the device cannot be removed, and the status is set to "okay" to indicate that the device is operational.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities. The device tree syntax and properties used are standard and do not indicate any potential security issues. The non-removable property is a valid property for a device node, and the status property is set to a valid value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix potential vulnerabilities.  Please note that this code snippet is a device tree blob file, which is a specific type of file used in Linux systems. The security of this code snippet is dependent on the overall security of the Linux system and the device tree blob file as a whole.  It is possible that vulnerabilities could exist in the device tree
