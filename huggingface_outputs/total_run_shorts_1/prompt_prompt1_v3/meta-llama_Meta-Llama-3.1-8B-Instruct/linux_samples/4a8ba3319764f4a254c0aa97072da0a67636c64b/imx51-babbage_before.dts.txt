 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a hardcoded value for the regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt properties. This can lead to issues if the actual voltage requirements change in the future.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines two regulators, reg_usbh1_vbus and reg_usbotg_vbus, with hardcoded values for the regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt properties. These values are set to 5000000, which may not be the actual voltage requirements for the regulators. If the actual voltage requirements change in the future, this hardcoded value may lead to issues such as overvoltage or undervoltage conditions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded values for the regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt properties should be replaced with a more dynamic approach, such as using a device tree binding or a firmware configuration file to specify the actual voltage requirements. This will ensure that the regulators are configured correctly and safely, even if the voltage requirements change in the future. Additionally, it is recommended to add a check to ensure that the actual voltage requirements are within the
