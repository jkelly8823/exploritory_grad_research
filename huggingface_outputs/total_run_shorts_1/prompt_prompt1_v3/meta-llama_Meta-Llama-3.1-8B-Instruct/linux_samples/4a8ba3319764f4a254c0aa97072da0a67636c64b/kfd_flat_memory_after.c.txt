VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential use-after-free bug. The variable 'pdd' is freed when the function returns -1, but it is still being used in the next iteration of the loop.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'pdd' is freed when the function returns -1, but it is still being used in the next iteration of the loop. This is a classic example of a use-after-free bug. The variable 'pdd' is being used after it has been freed, which can lead to undefined behavior and potentially cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the variable 'pdd' should be freed before the function returns -1. This can be done by adding a check to see if 'pdd' is NULL before using it, and freeing it if it is NULL. Alternatively, the function can be modified to not use 'pdd' after it has been freed. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all variables are properly freed before they are used again.
