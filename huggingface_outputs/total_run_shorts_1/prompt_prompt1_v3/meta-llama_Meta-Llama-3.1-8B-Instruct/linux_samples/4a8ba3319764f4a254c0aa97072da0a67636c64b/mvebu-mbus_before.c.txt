VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function mvebu_mbus_window_is_free does not check if the window number is within the valid range before accessing the memory location at addr.
EXPLANATION: The function assumes that the window number is valid and does not perform any bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access if an invalid window number is passed to the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that the window number is within the valid range before accessing the memory location at addr. This can be done by checking if the window number is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the number of valid windows. For example: if (win < 0 || win >= mbus->soc->num_windows) return -EINVAL; before accessing the memory location at addr.  ````
