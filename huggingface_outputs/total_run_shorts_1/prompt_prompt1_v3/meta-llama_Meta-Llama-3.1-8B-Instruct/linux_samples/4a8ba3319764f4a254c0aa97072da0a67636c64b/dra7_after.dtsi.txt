VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains multiple instances of a potential vulnerability related to the "tx-fifo-resize" property. This property is used to resize the transmit FIFO, but it is not properly validated or sanitized, which could lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The "tx-fifo-resize" property is used to resize the transmit FIFO, but it is not properly validated or sanitized. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues if an attacker is able to manipulate the value of this property. The code snippet contains multiple instances of this property, which increases the risk of a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate and sanitize the value of the "tx-fifo-resize" property. This could be done by using a whitelist of allowed values or by implementing additional validation checks. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all instances of the "tx-fifo-resize" property are properly validated and sanitized.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the "maximum-speed" property is
