VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a C header file, specifically a board-specific configuration file for the OMAP3 architecture. The code defines a static array of board compatibility strings, which is a common practice in Linux kernel development. The code snippet is well-structured and follows standard C syntax.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a standard and safe implementation. 

Note: The code snippet is a part of a larger C header file, and the `#endif` directive at the beginning suggests that this code is enclosed within a conditional compilation block. However, without the surrounding code, it is impossible to determine the context and potential issues.
