 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the use of ioremap_nocache without proper unmapping of the memory regions.
EXPLANATION: The ioremap_nocache function is used to map physical memory into the kernel's virtual address space. However, the unmapping of these memory regions is not performed in the given code snippet. This can lead to a memory leak, as the memory regions remain mapped even after they are no longer needed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the iounmap function should be used to unmap the memory regions after they are no longer needed. For example, the following code can be added to unmap the memory regions: iounmap(intc_msk_base); iounmap(pfc_inta_ctrl); #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_SHMOBILE_LEGACY iounmap(gic_dist_base); iounmap(gic_cpu_base); #endif. This will ensure that the memory regions are properly unmapped and prevent a potential memory leak.  ```bash
