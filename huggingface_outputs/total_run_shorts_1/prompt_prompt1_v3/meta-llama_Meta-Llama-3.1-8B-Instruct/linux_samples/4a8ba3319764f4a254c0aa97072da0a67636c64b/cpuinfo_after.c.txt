VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If the cpuinfo structure is not properly initialized, the function fcpu_has() will return a null pointer, and the code will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is checking for the presence of certain CPU features using the fcpu_has() function. However, it does not check if the cpuinfo structure is properly initialized before accessing its members. If the cpuinfo structure is not initialized, the fcpu_has() function will return a null pointer, and the code will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the cpuinfo structure is properly initialized before accessing its members. This can be done by adding a null check before calling the fcpu_has() function. For example: if (cpuinfo!= NULL && cpuinfo.has_div == NULL) {... }.
