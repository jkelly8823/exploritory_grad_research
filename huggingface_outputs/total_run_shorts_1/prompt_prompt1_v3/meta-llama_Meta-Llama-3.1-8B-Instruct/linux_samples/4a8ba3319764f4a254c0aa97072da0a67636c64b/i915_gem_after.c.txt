 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the i915_gem_create function. The function does not check if the obj pointer is null before dereferencing it.
EXPLANATION: The i915_gem_create function checks if the obj pointer is null, but it does not check if the obj pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function should be modified to check if the obj pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can be done by adding a null check before the line where the obj pointer is dereferenced. For example: if (obj!= NULL) {... } else { return -ENOMEM; }.
