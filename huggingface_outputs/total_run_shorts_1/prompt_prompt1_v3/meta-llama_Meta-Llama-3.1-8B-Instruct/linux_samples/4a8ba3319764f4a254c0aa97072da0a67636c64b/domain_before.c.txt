VULNERABLE: NO

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function of_genpd_get_from_provider() does not properly handle the case where the provider is not found.
EXPLANATION:
The function of_genpd_get_from_provider() is supposed to return a valid pointer to struct generic_pm_domain on success or ERR_PTR() on failure. However, it does not properly handle the case where the provider is not found. It simply returns the default value of genpd which is ERR_PTR(-ENOENT), without checking if the provider is actually found. This can lead to incorrect results and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The function of_genpd_get_from_provider() should be modified to properly check if the provider is found before returning the result. This can be done by checking the return value of the function that retrieves the provider. If the provider is not found, the function should return ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) explicitly.
