 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the preempt_disable() call and the local_irq_enable() call. The preempt_disable() call prevents other CPUs from preempting the current CPU, but the local_irq_enable() call enables interrupts on the current CPU. This can lead to a situation where another CPU can preempt the current CPU while it is still executing the cpu_startup_entry() function, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The preempt_disable() call is used to prevent other CPUs from preempting the current CPU, but it does not prevent the current CPU from being preempted by another CPU. The local_irq_enable() call enables interrupts on the current CPU, which can cause the current CPU to be preempted by another CPU. This creates a window of opportunity for a race condition to occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the preempt_disable() call should be moved to after the local_irq_enable() call. This will ensure that the current CPU is not preempted by another CPU while it is still executing the cpu_startup_entry() function. Alternatively, the preempt_disable() call could be removed altogether, as it is not necessary in this case
