VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `round_up` function without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `round_up` function is used to round up the `start` variable to the nearest multiple of `step_size`. However, if `step_size` is 0, the function will return 0, which can cause a buffer overflow when used in the `init_range_memory_mapping` function. This is because the `init_range_memory_mapping` function does not check if the `start` variable is within the valid range before using it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add a check to ensure that `step_size` is not 0 before using the `round_up` function. Additionally, the `init_range_memory_mapping` function should be modified to check if the `start` variable is within the valid range before using it. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
if (step_size && map_end - start > step_size) {
    next = round_up(start + 1, step_size);
    if (next > map_end)
        next
