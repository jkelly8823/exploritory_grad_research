 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a device tree source file, which is used to describe the hardware components of a Linux-based system. The code snippet defines two clock muxes, which are used to select the source of the pll1_bypass_src and pll2_bypass_src clocks. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided, as the code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and to follow best practices for coding and security.  The code snippet appears to be well-structured and follows the conventions of the device tree source file.  It is also worth noting that the code snippet is likely to be executed in a controlled environment, such as a Linux-based system, where the potential impact of a vulnerability may be limited.  Nevertheless, it is always better to err on the side of caution and to take steps to prevent potential vulnerabilities.  In this
