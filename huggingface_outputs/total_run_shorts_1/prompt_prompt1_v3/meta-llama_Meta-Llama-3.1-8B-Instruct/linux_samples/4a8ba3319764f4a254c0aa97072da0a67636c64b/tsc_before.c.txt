 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of the goto statement. The goto statement can lead to unpredictable behavior and make the code harder to debug and maintain.
EXPLANATION: The goto statement is used to jump to the success label, which can cause the code to skip over important error handling and logging. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to diagnose issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more structured approach to error handling, such as using a return statement or a throw/catch block. This will make the code more predictable and easier to maintain. Additionally, consider removing the goto statement and instead using a more explicit control flow, such as a conditional statement or a loop. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.  ````
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    else:
        return length * width

# Test the function
print(calculate_area(5, 10))  # Output: 50
print(calculate_area(-1, 10))
