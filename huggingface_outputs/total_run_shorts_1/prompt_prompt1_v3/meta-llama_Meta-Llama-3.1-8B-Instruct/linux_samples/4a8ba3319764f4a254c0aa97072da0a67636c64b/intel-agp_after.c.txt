VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a kernel module initialization and cleanup function, which is a common practice in Linux kernel development. However, there are a few potential issues that could be considered vulnerabilities:
* The use of the `module_init` and `module_exit` macros is correct, but the function names `agp_intel_init` and `agp_intel_cleanup` are not explicitly defined in this snippet. This could potentially lead to issues if the functions are not properly defined elsewhere in the codebase.
* The `MODULE_AUTHOR` and `MODULE_LICENSE` macros are used correctly, but the string literals used in these macros may not be properly sanitized, which could potentially lead to security issues if the strings are not properly validated.
