 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be checking for the presence of a 32-bit EL1 CPU and resetting the CPU registers accordingly. However, there is no apparent vulnerability in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is checking for the presence of a 32-bit EL1 CPU and resetting the CPU registers accordingly. The `cpu_has_32bit_el1()` function is used to determine whether the CPU is 32-bit EL1 or not. If it is not, the code returns an error code of -EINVAL. If it is, the code sets the `cpu_reset` variable to point to the `default_regs_reset32` function. If the CPU is not 32-bit EL1, the code sets the `cpu_reset` variable to point to the `default_regs_reset` function. There is no apparent vulnerability in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not contain any vulnerabilities.  The code is well-structured and follows good practices. However, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of the `cpu_has_32bit_el1()` function and
