VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The function `fill_ldt` is called with a null pointer when `LDT_empty(info)` or `LDT_zero(info)` is true.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The function `fill_ldt` is called with a pointer to `desc` which is not checked for null before being dereferenced.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if `info` is empty or zero before calling `fill_ldt`. However, it does not check if `desc` is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if `desc` is null. Additionally, the function `fill_ldt` is called with a pointer to `desc` which is not checked for null before being dereferenced. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `desc` is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if `desc` is null before dereferencing it. The function `fill_ldt` should also check if `desc` is null before dereferencing it. Additionally, the function `
