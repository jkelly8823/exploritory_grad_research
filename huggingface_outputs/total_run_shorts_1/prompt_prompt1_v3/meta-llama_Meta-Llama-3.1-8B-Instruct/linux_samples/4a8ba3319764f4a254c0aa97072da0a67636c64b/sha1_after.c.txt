 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a Linux kernel module declaration.
It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a standard Linux kernel module declaration.
It includes the necessary license and description information.
It also includes the necessary alias information for the SHA1 secure hash algorithm.
There are no obvious security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure.  Please note that this code snippet is a Linux kernel module declaration and may be subject to additional security considerations based on its implementation and usage within the kernel.  However, based on the provided code snippet alone, there are no obvious security vulnerabilities.  Further analysis would be required to determine the overall security posture of this code.  It is also worth noting that the code snippet does not contain any user input or data processing, which reduces the risk of certain types of security vulnerabilities.  However, it is still possible for security vulnerabilities to exist in the implementation of the SHA1 secure hash algorithm itself, which is not shown in this code snippet.  Further analysis of the implementation of the SHA1 secure hash algorithm would be
