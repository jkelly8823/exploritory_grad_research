VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it directly accesses and modifies an array (rbuf) without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet directly accesses and modifies the array rbuf without checking the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the index used to access the array is out of range. In this case, the code is accessing rbuf[15] and rbuf[14] without checking if these indices are within the valid range of the array. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include bounds checking before accessing the array. This can be done by checking the size of the array and ensuring that the index used to access the array is within the valid range. For example, the code could be modified to use a loop to iterate over the array and check the bounds of each index before accessing the array. Alternatively, the code could be modified to use a safer data structure, such as a vector or a list, that includes built-in bounds checking.  ```c
