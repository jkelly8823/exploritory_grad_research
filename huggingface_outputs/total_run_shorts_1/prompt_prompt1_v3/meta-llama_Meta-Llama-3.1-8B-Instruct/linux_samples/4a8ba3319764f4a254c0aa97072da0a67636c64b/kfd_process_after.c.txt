VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the synchronize_rcu() call and the subsequent mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() call.
EXPLANATION: The synchronize_rcu() call is used to wait for all RCU callbacks to complete. However, the mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() call is not RCU-safe and can be executed concurrently with the RCU callbacks. This can lead to a race condition where the mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() call is executed before the RCU callbacks have completed, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the synchronize_rcu() call should be moved before the mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() call. This ensures that all RCU callbacks have completed before the mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() call is executed. Alternatively, the mmu_notifier_unregister_no_release() call can be made RCU-safe by using the mmu_notifier_unregister_release() function instead.
