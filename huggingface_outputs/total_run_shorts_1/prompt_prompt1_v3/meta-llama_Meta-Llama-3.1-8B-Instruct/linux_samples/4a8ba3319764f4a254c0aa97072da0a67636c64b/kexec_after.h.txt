VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `overlaps_crashkernel` does not check if the crash kernel overlaps with the current kernel's memory space. This can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function `overlaps_crashkernel` simply returns 0 without checking if the crash kernel overlaps with the current kernel's memory space. This is a vulnerability because it can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior if the crash kernel does overlap with the current kernel's memory space.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function `overlaps_crashkernel` should be modified to check if the crash kernel overlaps with the current kernel's memory space. This can be done by checking if the start address of the crash kernel is within the current kernel's memory space. If it is, the function should return 1, indicating that the crash kernel overlaps with the current kernel's memory space. If it is not, the function should return 0, indicating that the crash kernel does not overlap with the current kernel's memory space. For example: `static inline int overlaps_crashkernel(unsigned long start, unsigned long size) { return (start >= 0x100
