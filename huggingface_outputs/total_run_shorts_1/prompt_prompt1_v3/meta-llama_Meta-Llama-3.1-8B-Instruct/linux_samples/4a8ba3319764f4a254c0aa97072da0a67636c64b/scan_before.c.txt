VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The acpi_power_resources_list_free function is called on the device->wakeup.resources pointer when the device->wakeup.flags.valid flag is set. However, the device->wakeup.resources pointer is not checked for NULL before being freed. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the device->wakeup.resources pointer is accessed after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The acpi_power_resources_list_free function is called on the device->wakeup.resources pointer when the device->wakeup.flags.valid flag is set. However, the device->wakeup.resources pointer is not checked for NULL before being freed. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the device->wakeup.resources pointer is accessed after it has been freed. The code does not check if the device->wakeup.resources pointer is NULL before freeing it, which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the device->wakeup.resources pointer is NULL before freeing it. This can be done by adding a simple NULL check before calling
