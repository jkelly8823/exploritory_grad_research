 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a list of PCI device IDs and their corresponding board types. The PCI_VDEVICE macro is used to define each device, and the board_ahci variable is used to specify the board type for each device. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). However, it is worth noting that the code may be vulnerable to certain types of attacks if it is not properly validated or sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. However, it is recommended to validate and sanitize any user input or data that is used in this code to prevent potential security issues. Additionally, it may be a good idea to consider using a more secure method of storing and retrieving PCI device IDs and board types, such as using a database or a secure configuration file.  This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities, but it is always a good idea to follow best practices for security and validation.  This code snippet appears to be a list of PCI device IDs and their corresponding board types.
