VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The sed command is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The input string "$i" is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. This can lead to unauthorized access, data tampering, or other malicious activities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent command injection. In this case, use the -e option with sed to specify the command to be executed, and ensure that the input string is properly sanitized. For example: sed -e's@.*/\* *\("[^"]*"\).*\*/@\1@p' <<< "$i". Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to sed, such as grep or awk.  Also, ensure that the input string "$i" is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the sed command.  Consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input string.  This will prevent any malicious input from being executed.  Also, consider using a library that can handle the sanitization of the input string for you.  This will make the code more secure and easier to maintain.  Finally, consider logging any errors
