VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array (rk3288_cpuclk_rates) to store a large number of elements.
EXPLANATION: The rk3288_cpuclk_rates array is declared with a fixed size of 14 elements, but the code attempts to initialize it with 14 elements as well. However, if the number of elements exceeds the fixed size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a crash. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, consider using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized data, such as a linked list or a vector. Alternatively, you can increase the fixed size of the array to accommodate the maximum number of elements expected. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the array is not accessed beyond its valid indices.
