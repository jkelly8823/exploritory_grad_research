VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of an array of structs without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines an array of structs `hswep_uncore_ha` without specifying its size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the driver attempts to access an index outside the bounds of the array. Additionally, the use of an array of structs without bounds checking can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the array `hswep_uncore_ha` should be explicitly specified. The code should also include bounds checking to prevent accessing indices outside the array's bounds. For example, the code can use a loop to iterate over the array and check the index before accessing it. Alternatively, the code can use a safer data structure such as a linked list or a vector. 

Note: The vulnerability is not directly related to the PCI driver code, but rather to the struct definition. The PCI driver code is just a part of the larger codebase, and the vulnerability is present in the struct definition. 

Also, the code snippet is missing some parts
