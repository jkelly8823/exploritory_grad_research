VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `skb_copy_bits` function is called with a fixed length of 4, 2, or 1 bytes, but the length is not checked against the actual length of the data in the skb. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `skb_copy_bits` function is used to copy data from the skb to a temporary buffer. However, the length of the data to be copied is not checked against the actual length of the data in the skb. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. The `skb_copy_bits` function is called with a fixed length of 4, 2, or 1 bytes, but the length is not checked against the actual length of the data in the skb.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check the length of the data in the skb before calling the `skb_copy_bits` function. This can be done by checking the length of the skb data using the `skb_len` function and comparing it to the fixed length used
