VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function handle_relocations() is called with a pointer to a local variable (output) which may have been deallocated by the time handle_relocations() is called.
EXPLANATION: The function handle_relocations() is called with a pointer to the local variable output. However, the function decompress() may have deallocated the memory pointed to by output before handle_relocations() is called. This is because decompress() does not return the decompressed data, but instead stores it in the local variable output. If decompress() fails and returns an error, the memory pointed to by output may be deallocated, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function decompress() should be modified to return the decompressed data instead of storing it in a local variable. Alternatively, the function handle_relocations() should be modified to take a pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer instead of a local variable. Additionally, error handling should be improved to ensure that the memory pointed to by output is not deallocated prematurely.  The function handle_relocations() should also be modified to check if the pointer to output is
