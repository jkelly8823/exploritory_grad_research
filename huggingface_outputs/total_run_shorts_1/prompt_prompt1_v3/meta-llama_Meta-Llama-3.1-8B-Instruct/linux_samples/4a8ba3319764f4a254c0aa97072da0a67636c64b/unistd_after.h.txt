 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the lack of proper handling of system calls that are not present on 64-bit architectures.
EXPLANATION: The code defines system call numbers for various system calls, but it does not account for the fact that some system calls may not be present on 64-bit architectures. This can lead to undefined behavior or crashes when trying to access these system calls.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to handle system calls that are not present on 64-bit architectures. This can be done by checking the architecture before accessing the system calls, or by using a more robust method to determine the availability of system calls. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all system calls are properly handled and accounted for.  ````
