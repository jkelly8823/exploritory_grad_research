VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple assignment of function pointers and values to a struct. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. The use of function pointers is a common practice in embedded systems programming and is not inherently vulnerable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that the function pointers being assigned are valid and correctly implemented. Additionally, the use of magic numbers (e.g. 200) should be avoided and replaced with named constants for better code readability and maintainability.  ```bash
