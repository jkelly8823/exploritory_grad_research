VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a header file for a kernel module, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The functions declared in this file are either inline functions that do nothing (crash_kexec_secondary) or they are external functions that are not defined in this file (reserve_crashkernel and machine_kexec_mask_interrupts). The function overlaps_crashkernel is also an inline function that simply returns 0, which does not pose any security risk. The code snippet also includes various conditional compilation directives, but these do not appear to introduce any vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
