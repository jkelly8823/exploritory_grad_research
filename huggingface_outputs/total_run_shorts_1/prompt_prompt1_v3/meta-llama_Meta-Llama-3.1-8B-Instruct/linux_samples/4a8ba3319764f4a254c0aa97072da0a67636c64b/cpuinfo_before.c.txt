VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If CONFIG_NIOS2_HW_DIV_SUPPORT is enabled but cpuinfo.has_div is false, then the err_cpu function will be called with a null pointer.
EXPLANATION: The err_cpu function is called with a null pointer when CONFIG_NIOS2_HW_DIV_SUPPORT is enabled but cpuinfo.has_div is false. This is because cpuinfo.has_div is a pointer to a function that returns a boolean value, and it is not checked for null before being dereferenced. If cpuinfo.has_div is null, then calling it will result in a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The err_cpu function should be called with a valid pointer. The code should check if cpuinfo.has_div is null before calling err_cpu. If it is null, then an error message should be printed instead. Alternatively, the err_cpu function could be modified to handle null pointers.
