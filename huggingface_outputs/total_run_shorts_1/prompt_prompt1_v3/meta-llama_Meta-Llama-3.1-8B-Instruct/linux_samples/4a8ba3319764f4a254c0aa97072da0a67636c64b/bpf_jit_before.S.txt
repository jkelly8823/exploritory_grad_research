VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20, 26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `skb_copy_bits` function. The function is called with a pointer to a temporary buffer, but the buffer size is not checked, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `skb_copy_bits` function is called with a pointer to a temporary buffer, but the buffer size is not checked. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code. The `skb_copy_bits` function is used to copy data from a socket buffer to a temporary buffer, but it does not check the size of the temporary buffer, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `skb_copy_bits` function should be modified to check the size of the temporary buffer before copying data to it. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the temporary buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. Additionally, the `skb_copy_bits` function should be modified to handle buffer overflows by checking the return value of the function and handling any errors that may occur. The code should
