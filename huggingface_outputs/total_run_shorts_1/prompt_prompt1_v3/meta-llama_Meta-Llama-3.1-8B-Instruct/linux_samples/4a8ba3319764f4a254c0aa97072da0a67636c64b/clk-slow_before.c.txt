 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A double free vulnerability is present in the code. The function clk_slow_osc_prepare() attempts to free the memory of slowck in the event of an error, but this memory has already been freed in the previous call to clk_register(). This is a double free vulnerability because the memory is being freed twice.
EXPLANATION: The double free vulnerability occurs because the function clk_slow_osc_prepare() attempts to free the memory of slowck in the event of an error, but this memory has already been freed in the previous call to clk_register(). This is a double free vulnerability because the memory is being freed twice. The function clk_register() takes ownership of the memory of slowck and frees it when it is no longer needed. Therefore, the function clk_slow_osc_prepare() should not attempt to free the memory of slowck.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function clk_slow_osc_prepare() should be modified to not attempt to free the memory of slowck in the event of an error. Instead, it should return an error code to indicate that the memory could not be freed. The function clk_register() should be called before the function
