VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the repeated calls to drm_modeset_unlock_all(dev) without a corresponding lock release.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances of the same conditional block. In each instance, the lock is acquired with __drm_modeset_lock_all(dev,!!oops_in_progress), but the lock is not released in the case where drm_fb_helper_is_bound(fb_helper) is true. This can lead to a resource leak if the lock is not released properly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be refactored to release the lock in the case where drm_fb_helper_is_bound(fb_helper) is true. This can be achieved by adding a call to drm_modeset_unlock_all(dev) before returning -EBUSY. Additionally, the repeated conditional block can be removed to simplify the code and reduce the risk of resource leaks. The corrected code should look like this: if (__drm_modeset_lock_all(dev,!!oops_in_progress)) { return -EBUSY; } if (!drm_fb_helper_is_bound(fb_helper)) { drm_modeset_unlock_all(dev); return
