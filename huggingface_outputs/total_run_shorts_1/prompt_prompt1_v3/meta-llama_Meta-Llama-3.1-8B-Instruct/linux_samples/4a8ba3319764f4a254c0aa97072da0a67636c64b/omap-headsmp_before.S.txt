 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  There are no vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The code appears to be a set of assembly language instructions for booting a secondary CPU on an OMAP5 or OMAP4 processor. The code defines a physical address for the secondary core and provides entry points for the secondary CPU to jump from ROM code. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the code is specific to OMAP5 and OMAP4 processors and may not be portable to other architectures.
