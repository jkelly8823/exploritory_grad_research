VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANANATION: The sed command is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The input string "$i" is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. This can lead to unauthorized access, data tampering, or other malicious activities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent command injection. In this case, use the sed command with a fixed pattern to avoid using user input. For example, use sed -n's@.*/\* *\("[^"]*"\).*\*/@\1@p' instead of sed -n's@.*/\* *\("[^"]*"\).*\*/@\1@p' to prevent command injection. Additionally, validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential attacks.  Also, use a safer way to convert the string to lowercase, such as using the `tr` command with a fixed string, like `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`.  Also, use a safer way to assign the value to the variable, like `VALUE=$(echo "$VALUE" | tr '[:upper:]' '
