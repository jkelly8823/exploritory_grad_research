VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential integer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The variable `last_residency` is calculated by subtracting `exit_latency` from `cpuidle_get_last_residency(dev)`. If `cpuidle_get_last_residency(dev)` is a large number and `exit_latency` is a small number, the subtraction could result in an integer underflow, causing `last_residency` to wrap around to a large positive value.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a subtraction operation to calculate `last_residency`. However, if the result of the subtraction is negative, it will cause an integer underflow, resulting in a large positive value. This could potentially lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer method to calculate `last_residency`, such as using a library function that handles integer overflows or using a data type that can handle large values, such as a 64-bit integer. Additionally, consider adding input validation to ensure that `cpuidle_get_last_residency(dev)` and `exit_latency` are within a valid range before performing the subtraction.  The
