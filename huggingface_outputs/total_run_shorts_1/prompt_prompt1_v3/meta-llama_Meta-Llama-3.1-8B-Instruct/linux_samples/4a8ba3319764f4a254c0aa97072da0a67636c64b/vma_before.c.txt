 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information leak due to the use of the get_random_int() function, which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's entropy pool.
EXPLANATION: The get_random_int() function is used to generate a random offset for the vdso_addr calculation. However, this function can potentially leak information about the system's entropy pool, which can be used to compromise the system's security. This is because the get_random_int() function is not designed to be cryptographically secure and can potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's entropy pool.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as the get_random_bytes() function, to generate the random offset. This will ensure that the system's entropy pool is not compromised and that the vdso_addr calculation is secure. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not use any other functions that may potentially leak sensitive information.  The use of get_random_int() should be avoided in favor of a more secure alternative.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to
