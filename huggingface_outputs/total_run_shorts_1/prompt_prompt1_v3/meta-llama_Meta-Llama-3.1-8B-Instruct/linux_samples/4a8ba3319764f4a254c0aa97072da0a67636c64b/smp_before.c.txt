 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the preempt_disable() call and the local_irq_enable() call. This is because preempt_disable() only disables preemption for the current task, but does not prevent interrupts from occurring. Meanwhile, local_irq_enable() enables interrupts for the current task. If an interrupt occurs between these two calls, it could potentially preempt the current task and cause the CPU to be marked as online before it has completed its initialization.
EXPLANATION: The preempt_disable() call is intended to prevent the scheduler from preempting the current task while it is initializing the CPU. However, this call does not prevent interrupts from occurring. If an interrupt occurs between the preempt_disable() and local_irq_enable() calls, it could cause the CPU to be marked as online before it has completed its initialization. This could lead to a race condition where the CPU is marked as online before it has completed its initialization, potentially causing the system to become unstable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the preempt_disable() call should be replaced with a call to preempt_disable_notrace() or preempt_disable_no_resched(). These calls will prevent both preemption and interrupts from occurring,
