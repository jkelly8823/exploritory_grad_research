 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The acpi_power_resources_list_free function is called on the device->wakeup.resources pointer before the function acpi_bus_init_power(device) is called. If acpi_bus_init_power(device) fails, the device->wakeup.resources pointer will be freed, but the function will still attempt to access it.
EXPLANATION: The acpi_power_resources_list_free function is called on the device->wakeup.resources pointer before the function acpi_bus_init_power(device) is called. If acpi_bus_init_power(device) fails, the device->wakeup.resources pointer will be freed, but the function will still attempt to access it. This is a potential use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The acpi_power_resources_list_free function should be called after the acpi_bus_init_power(device) function to ensure that the device->wakeup.resources pointer is not freed before it is accessed. Alternatively, the acpi_bus_init_power(device) function should be called before the acpi_power_resources_list_free function to ensure that the device->wakeup.resources pointer is not accessed after it
