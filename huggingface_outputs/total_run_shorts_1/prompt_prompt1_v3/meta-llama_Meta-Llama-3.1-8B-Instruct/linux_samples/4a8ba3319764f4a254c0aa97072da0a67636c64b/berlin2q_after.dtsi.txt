VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the use of a deprecated property "compatible" in the "chip-control" node. The "compatible" property is used to specify the compatible device tree bindings, but it is deprecated in favor of the "compatible" property in the "device" node.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a deprecated property "compatible" in the "chip-control" node. This property is used to specify the compatible device tree bindings, but it is deprecated in favor of the "compatible" property in the device node. This can cause issues when trying to use device tree bindings that are not compatible with the deprecated property.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the deprecated "compatible" property with the "compatible" property in the "device" node. For example, change the line "compatible = "marvell,berlin2q-chip-ctrl";" to "device_type = "chip"; compatible = "marvell,berlin2
