VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the acpi_map_cpu function due to the lack of input validation on the physid parameter.
EXPLANATION: The acpi_map_cpu function takes a physid parameter which is not validated for its range or type. This allows an attacker to potentially pass a large or negative value for physid, leading to a buffer overflow when the function attempts to access the ia64_cpu_to_sapicid array with the provided index.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the acpi_map_cpu function should be modified to validate the physid parameter before accessing the ia64_cpu_to_sapicid array. This can be achieved by adding a simple check to ensure that physid is within the valid range of indices for the array. For example: if (physid < 0 || physid >= IA64_MAX_CPUS) return -EINVAL;. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where physid is a negative value, as this could also lead to a buffer overflow. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that physid is not negative before accessing the array. For example:
