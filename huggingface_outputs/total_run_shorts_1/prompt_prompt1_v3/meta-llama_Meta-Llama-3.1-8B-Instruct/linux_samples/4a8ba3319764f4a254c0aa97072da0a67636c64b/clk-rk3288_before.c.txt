 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array (rk3288_cpuclk_rates) to store a large number of elements.
EXPLANATION: The rk3288_cpuclk_rates array is declared with a fixed size of 14 elements, but the code snippet contains 14 elements to be stored in this array. If the number of elements exceeds the fixed size, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically-sized data structure, such as a linked list or a dynamically-allocated array, to store the elements. Alternatively, you can increase the fixed size of the array to accommodate the maximum number of elements expected. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the array is not accessed beyond its valid indices.  VULNERABLE: YES
