 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for handling PCI device information. It defines several macros for extracting device type and index from a given data value, as well as constants for representing extra PCI devices and socket maximums. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a well-structured and safe implementation of PCI device handling macros.  Please let me know if you need anything else.
