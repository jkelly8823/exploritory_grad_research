VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential issue with the drive strength of the SDMMC pins. The drive strength is set to 8ma, which may not be sufficient for high-speed mode on the EVB board.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is a device tree overlay for a Rockchip-based board. The vulnerability lies in the drive strength of the SDMMC pins, which is set to 8ma. This may not be sufficient for high-speed mode on the EVB board, as mentioned in the comment. This could potentially lead to issues with data transfer rates or even device recognition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the drive strength of the SDMMC pins should be increased to a value that is sufficient for high-speed mode. This can be done by changing the drive-strength value in the pcfg_pull_up_drv_8ma and pcfg_pull_none_drv_8ma configurations. For example, the drive-strength value could be increased to 16ma or higher, depending on the specific requirements of the board. Additionally, it may be necessary to adjust the bias-pull-up value in the pcfg_pull_up_drv_
