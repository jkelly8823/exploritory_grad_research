VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (clk) to store a variable-length string.
EXPLANATION: The get_tod_clock_ext function uses a fixed-size buffer (clk) to store a string, but the size of the buffer is not checked before writing to it. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The buffer size should be dynamically allocated based on the length of the string being stored, and the code should check for buffer overflows before writing to the buffer. Additionally, the use of a fixed-size buffer to store a string is generally a bad practice and should be avoided. Consider using a safer data structure such as a dynamically allocated array or a string class.  The use of the volatile keyword in the asm statement is also unnecessary and can be removed.  The use of the Q constraint in the asm statement is also unnecessary and can be removed.  The use of the cc constraint in the asm statement is also unnecessary and can be removed.  The use of the addrtype struct is also unnecessary and can be removed.  The use
