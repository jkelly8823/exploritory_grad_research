VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be checking for a condition where enabling big endian exceptions fails, and if so, it panics with an error message. However, the panic message does not provide any useful information about the failure, and the code does not attempt to recover from the failure in a way that would be helpful for debugging.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is checking for a condition where enabling big endian exceptions fails, and if so, it panics with an error message. However, the panic message does not provide any useful information about the failure, and the code does not attempt to recover from the failure in a way that would be helpful for debugging. This could potentially lead to a difficult to debug situation, as the error message does not provide any information about what went wrong.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Modify the panic message to include more information about the failure, such as the return code of the function that failed.
2. Consider adding additional error handling to recover from the failure in a way that would be helpful for debugging, such as logging the error or providing a more detailed error message. 3. Consider using a more robust error
