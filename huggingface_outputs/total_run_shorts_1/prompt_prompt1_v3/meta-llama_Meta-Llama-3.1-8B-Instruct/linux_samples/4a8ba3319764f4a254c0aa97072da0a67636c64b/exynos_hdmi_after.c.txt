VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the'reg' variable.
EXPLANATION: The'reg' variable is assigned a value based on the 'hdata->type' field, which can take on different values. However, the assignment does not check if the value is within a valid range, potentially allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the'reg' variable is within a valid range. This can be done by using a switch statement or a series of if-else statements to check the value of 'hdata->type' and assign a valid value to'reg'. For example: ```c
if (hdata->type == HDMI_TYPE13) {
    reg = HDMI_V13_PHY_RSTOUT;
} else if (hdata->type == HDMI_TYPE14) {
    reg = HDMI_V14_PHY_RSTOUT;
} else {
    // handle invalid type
}
