 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The value of regs->ra is being set to a fixed address (0x1044), which could potentially be outside the bounds of the stack or other memory regions, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code is attempting to set up a signal handler by setting the registers for the signal handler. However, the value of regs->ra is being set to a fixed address without any bounds checking. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the address is outside the bounds of the stack or other memory regions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the value of regs->ra before setting it. This could involve checking if the address is within the bounds of the stack or other memory regions. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer method for setting the registers, such as using a pointer to the signal handler function instead of a fixed address.  |
