RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a list of system call numbers and a comment describing the differences in system calls between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.  The code is well-structured and does not contain any potential vulnerabilities.  However, it would be beneficial to consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of the system call numbers and the differences in system calls between architectures.  This would make the code more understandable and maintainable.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider adding a check to ensure that the system call numbers are valid before using them.  This would prevent potential errors and make the code more robust.  However, these are just suggestions and not necessary for the code to
