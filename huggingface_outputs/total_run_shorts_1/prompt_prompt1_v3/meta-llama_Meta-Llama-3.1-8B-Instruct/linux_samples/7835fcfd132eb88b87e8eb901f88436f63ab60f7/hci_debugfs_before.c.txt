VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflow attacks. The code does not check for integer overflows when setting the values of `conn_info_min_age`, `conn_info_max_age`, `sniff_min_interval`, `sniff_max_interval`, `le_conn_min_interval`, `le_conn_max_interval`, `le_adv_min_interval`, and `le_adv_max_interval`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check for integer overflows when setting the values of the above-mentioned variables. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. For example, if `val` is a large number, it can cause the variables to overflow and take on unexpected values.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check for integer overflows when setting the values of the above-mentioned variables. This can be done by checking if `val` is within the valid range for each variable before setting its value. For example, the code can check
