VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of NLA_REJECT in the netlink attribute definition is a vulnerability. NLA_REJECT is used to indicate that an attribute is not supported, but it does not provide any information about the attribute. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the attribute is encountered.
EXPLANATION: The use of NLA_REJECT in the netlink attribute definition is a vulnerability because it does not provide any information about the attribute.

For example, a custom type can be
