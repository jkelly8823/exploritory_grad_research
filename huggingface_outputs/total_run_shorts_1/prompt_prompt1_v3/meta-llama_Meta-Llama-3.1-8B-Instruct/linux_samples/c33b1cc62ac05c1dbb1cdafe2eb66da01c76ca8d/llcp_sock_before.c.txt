VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The variable `llcp_sock->service_name` is freed in the event of an error, but it is still accessed later in the function.
EXPLANATION: The `if (!llcp_sock->service_name)` check is performed after the `llcp_sock->service_name` has been freed in the event of an error. This means that if an error occurs, the program will attempt to access memory that has already been freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `if (!llcp_sock->service_name)` check should be performed before the `llcp_sock->service_name` is freed. This can be achieved by moving the `if (!llcp_sock->service_name)` check to before the `llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock);` line. Additionally, the `ret = -ENOMEM;` assignment should be moved to before the `llcp_sock->service_name` is freed to ensure that the error is properly handled. The corrected code should look
