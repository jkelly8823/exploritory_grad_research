VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a potentially large value for the size variable without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the le32_to_cpu function to convert a 32-bit value to a host CPU integer. However, it does not check if the resulting value is within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer. If the value is larger than INT_MAX, it will cause a buffer overflow when used as the size of an array or buffer. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that the size variable is within the valid range for a 32-bit signed integer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if size is greater than INT_MAX before using it. For example: if (size > INT_MAX) { return -EFSCORRUPTED; } else { /* use size */ } ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
