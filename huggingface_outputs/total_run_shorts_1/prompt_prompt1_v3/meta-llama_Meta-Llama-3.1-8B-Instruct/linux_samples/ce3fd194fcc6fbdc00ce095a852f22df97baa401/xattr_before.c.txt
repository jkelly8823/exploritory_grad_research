VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the value size.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the value size is non-zero and the value offset is zero, but it does not check if the value size is within the bounds of the buffer. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the value size is within the bounds of the buffer. This can be done by checking if the value offset plus the value size is less than or equal to the buffer size. For example: if (offs + size <= buffer_size) {... } ``` ```
