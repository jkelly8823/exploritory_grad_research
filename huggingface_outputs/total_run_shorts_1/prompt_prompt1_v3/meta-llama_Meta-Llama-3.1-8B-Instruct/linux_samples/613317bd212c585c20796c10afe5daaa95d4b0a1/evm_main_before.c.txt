VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the xattr_value_len variable.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The xattr_value_len variable is used to determine the length of the xattr_data->digest buffer, but it is not checked for validity. If xattr_value_len is larger than the actual length of the digest buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the xattr_value_len variable to ensure it does not exceed the actual length of the digest buffer. This can be done by using the min function to clamp the value of xattr_value_len to the length of the digest buffer. For example: xattr_value_len = min(xattr_value_len, sizeof(xattr_data->digest));. Additionally, consider using a safer function such as strnlen to determine the length of the digest buffer.  Also, consider using a safer function such as memcpy_s to copy the digest buffer.  Also, consider using a safer function such as memcmp_s to compare the digest
