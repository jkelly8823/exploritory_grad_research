VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The strdup function allocates memory for the string, but it is freed immediately after. The tep_register_print_string function is called with a pointer to this freed memory, which can lead to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The strdup function allocates memory for the string, but it is freed immediately after. The tep_register_print_string function is called with a pointer to this freed memory, which can lead to undefined behavior. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the strdup function should not be called immediately before the free function. The strdup function should be called before the free function, and the pointer to the allocated memory should be stored in a variable. The variable should then be passed to the tep_register_print_string function. This will ensure that the memory is not freed until it is no longer needed. For example: printk = strdup(fmt+1); line = strtok_r(NULL, "\n", &next); free(printk); tep_register_print_string(pevent, printk, addr); should be changed to: printk = strdup(fmt+1); line =
