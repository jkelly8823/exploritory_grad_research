VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential Spectre variant 1 vulnerability due to the use of the "sti" instruction in the native_safe_halt function.
EXPLANATION: The "sti" instruction is used to enable interrupts, which can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the instruction stream and execute malicious code. This is a known vulnerability in the Spectre variant 1 attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the "sti" instruction should be removed from the native_safe_halt function. The function should be modified to only use the "hlt" instruction, which is a safer alternative. The modified function should look like this: static inline __cpuidle void native_safe_halt(void) { mds_idle_clear_cpu_buffers(); asm volatile("hlt": : :"memory"); }. This change will prevent the potential Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.  The native_halt function should also be modified to only use the "hlt" instruction. The modified function should look like this: static inline __cpuidle void native_halt(void) { mds_idle_clear_cpu_buffers(); asm volatile("hlt": :
