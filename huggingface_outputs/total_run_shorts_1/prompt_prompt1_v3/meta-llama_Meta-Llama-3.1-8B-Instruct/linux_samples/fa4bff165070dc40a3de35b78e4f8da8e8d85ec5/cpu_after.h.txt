 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
There are no vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module, specifically dealing with CPU device attributes. It defines function prototypes for showing L1TF and MDS information. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues, especially when dealing with sensitive information like CPU attributes.  Please review the code in the context of the larger project to ensure it meets all security requirements.  Additionally, ensure that the functions cpu_show_l1tf and cpu_show_mds are properly implemented to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  Consider using a code review tool to help identify potential issues.  Finally, ensure that the code is properly tested to prevent any potential issues.  Consider using a testing framework to help identify potential issues.  Please review the code in the context of the larger project to ensure it meets all security requirements.  Additionally, ensure that the functions cpu_show_l1tf and cpu_show_mds are properly implemented to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  Consider
