VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the static keys are not enabled, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
EXPLANATION: The code uses static_branch_likely to check if the static keys are enabled, but it does not handle the case where they are not enabled. This could potentially lead to a DoS attack if an attacker can manipulate the static keys.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to handle the case where the static keys are not enabled. This could be done by adding a check to see if the static keys are enabled before calling mds_clear_cpu_buffers. If the static keys are not enabled, the function should return early or take some other action to prevent a DoS attack. For example: if (!static_branch_likely(&mds_user_clear)) return; before the call to mds_clear_cpu_buffers in mds_user_clear_cpu_buffers. A similar check should be added to mds_idle_clear_cpu_buffers. 

Note: The code is using static_branch_likely which is a function that returns true if the static key is likely to be enabled. However, it does not guarantee that
