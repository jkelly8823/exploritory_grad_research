VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of static keys without proper initialization. Static keys are used to store sensitive information, and if not properly initialized, they can lead to information disclosure or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses DECLARE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE to declare two static keys, switch_mm_cond_ibpb and switch_mm_always_ibpb. However, it does not provide any initialization or setup for these keys. This can lead to undefined behavior or security issues if the keys are used without proper initialization.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly initialize the static keys before using them. This can be done by adding a call to DECLARE_STATIC_KEY_INIT or similar function to initialize the keys. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the static keys are used correctly and securely.  ```c
DECLARE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE(switch_mm_cond_ibpb);
DECLARE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE(switch_mm_always_ibpb);
