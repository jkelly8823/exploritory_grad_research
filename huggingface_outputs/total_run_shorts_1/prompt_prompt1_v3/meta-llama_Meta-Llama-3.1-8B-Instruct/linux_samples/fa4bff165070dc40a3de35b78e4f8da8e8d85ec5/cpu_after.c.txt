 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information disclosure vulnerability due to the use of the __weak attribute on the cpu_show_mds function. This attribute allows the function to be overridden by a stronger definition in a later translation unit, which could potentially lead to information disclosure if the overridden function is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The __weak attribute is used to indicate that a function can be overridden by a stronger definition in a later translation unit. In this case, the cpu_show_mds function is declared as __weak, which means that it can be overridden by a stronger definition in a later translation unit. This could potentially lead to information disclosure if the overridden function is not properly sanitized. For example, if the overridden function returns sensitive information, it could be disclosed to an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the __weak attribute should be removed from the cpu_show_mds function. This will ensure that the function is not overridden by a stronger definition in a later translation unit, and will prevent potential information disclosure. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it properly sanitizes any sensitive information that it returns. If the function is intended
