VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Spectre variant attack. The use of the "asm volatile" directive allows for speculative execution of the instructions within the directive, which can lead to a Spectre attack.
EXPLANATION: The "asm volatile" directive is used to prevent the compiler from reordering or removing the instructions within the directive. However, this directive does not prevent speculative execution of the instructions within the directive. An attacker can use this vulnerability to access sensitive data in the CPU's cache.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a different approach that does not rely on speculative execution. One possible solution is to use a software-based approach to implement the mwait instruction, such as using a loop to wait for the CPU to enter the desired state. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all sensitive data is properly protected from speculative execution attacks. The use of the "asm volatile" directive should be avoided whenever possible, and alternative approaches should be used to implement low-level CPU instructions. 

Note: The code is vulnerable to a Spectre variant attack, but it is not vulnerable to a Spectre v
