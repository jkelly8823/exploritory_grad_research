VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in this code. The variable 'acl' is set to NULL after a successful call to posix_acl_equiv_mode(), but it is not checked for NULL before being used in the subsequent if statement.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where posix_acl_equiv_mode() returns 0, indicating that the ACL is equivalent to the inode's mode. In this case, the 'acl' variable is set to NULL, but the code does not check for this condition before using the 'acl' variable in the if statement.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference because it does not properly check for the NULL condition of the 'acl' variable after it has been set to NULL. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior if the 'acl' variable is used in a subsequent operation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for the NULL condition of the 'acl' variable after it has been set to NULL. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check for NULL before using the
