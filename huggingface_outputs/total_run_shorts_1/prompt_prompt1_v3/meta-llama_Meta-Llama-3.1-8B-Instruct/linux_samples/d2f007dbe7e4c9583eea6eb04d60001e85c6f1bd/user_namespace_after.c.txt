VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The variable `new_map` is used after it has been freed in the `goto out` statement.
EXPLANATION: The `goto out` statement is executed when `new_idmap_permitted` returns false. However, the `new_map` variable is still used after this point, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the `new_map` variable is freed when `goto out` is executed, but it is still being accessed later in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `new_map` variable should be freed before the `goto out` statement is executed. Alternatively, the code can be restructured to avoid using the `goto` statement and instead use a more traditional error handling approach. The `new_map` variable should be freed when it is no longer needed, and the code should be modified to handle errors in a more robust way.
