 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the oom reaper and the current process. The oom reaper may run after the current process has dropped the mmap_sem, but before it has finished executing the __oom_reap_task_mm() function. This can cause the oom reaper to reap the mm before the current process has finished freeing its resources.
EXPLANATION: The oom reaper is run manually in the current process, and it reaps the mm and sets MMF_OOM_SKIP. However, the oom reaper may run again after the current process has dropped the mmap_sem, but before it has finished executing the __oom_reap_task_mm() function. This can cause the oom reaper to reap the mm again, which can lead to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the current process should wait for the oom reaper to finish reaping the mm before dropping the mmap_sem. This can be done by using a wait queue or a condition variable to wait for the oom reaper to finish its task. Alternatively, the oom reaper can be modified to check if
