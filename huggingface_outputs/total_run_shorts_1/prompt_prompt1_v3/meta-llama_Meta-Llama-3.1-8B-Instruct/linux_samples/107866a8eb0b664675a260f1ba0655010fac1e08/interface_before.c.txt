VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The dealloc_task is set to a new task before the previous task is stopped. This can lead to a situation where the previous task is still running and the new task is trying to access the queue, resulting in undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the dealloc_task is set to a new task before the previous task is stopped. This can lead to a situation where the previous task is still running and the new task is trying to access the queue, resulting in undefined behavior. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the dealloc_task should be set to the new task after the previous task has been stopped. This can be achieved by moving the line `queue->task = task;` after the line `kthread_stop(queue->task);`. The corrected code should look like this: 
``` 
if (queue->task) {
	kthread_stop(queue->task);
	queue->task = NULL;
}

if (queue->dealloc_task) {
	if (IS_ERR(task))
		goto kthread_err;
	queue->task = task;
