 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the sctp_do_bind function. The function first checks if the bind address is already in use, but then proceeds to add the address to the bind address list without acquiring a lock. This allows for a potential race condition where another process could add the address to the list between the check and the add operation.
EXPLANATION: The sctp_do_bind function first checks if the bind address is already in use by calling sock_prot_inuse_add. However, it does not acquire a lock before adding the address to the bind address list. This allows for a potential race condition where another process could add the address to the list between the check and the add operation. This could lead to a situation where the address is added to the list multiple times, causing unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the sctp_do_bind function should acquire a lock before adding the address to the bind address list. This can be done by calling spin_lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock) before the add operation. Additionally, the function should also check if the address is already in the list before adding it
