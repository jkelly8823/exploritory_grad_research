VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the `memcpy` function without bounds checking. The `memcpy` function can copy more data than the destination buffer can hold, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from the `rate_ie` and `wmm_ie` pointers to the `bss_cfg->rates` and `bss_cfg->wmm_info` buffers, respectively. However, the `memcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, which means that it can copy more data than the destination buffer can hold. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `strncpy` function instead of `memcpy`, which performs bounds checking and prevents buffer overflows. Additionally, the code should check the length of the `rate_ie` and `wmm_ie` buffers before copying data to the destination buffers. For example, the code can use the `strlen` function to get the length of the `rate_ie`
