VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The memcpy function is used to copy data into a buffer without checking the size of the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the memcpy function to copy data from the rate_ie and vendor_ie pointers into the bss_cfg->rates and bss_cfg->wmm_info buffers respectively. However, the code is not checking the size of the data being copied before copying it into the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the buffer size. The buffer overflow can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the data being copied before copying it into the buffer. This can be done by checking the length of the rate_ie and vendor_ie pointers before calling the memcpy function. Additionally, the code should use the safer strncpy function instead of memcpy to prevent buffer overflows. The code should also validate the input data to ensure that it is within the expected range.
