VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the host2rxdma array.
EXPLANATION: The host2rxdma array is declared with a size of ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX, which is a constant that can be modified. However, the array is not checked for bounds when it is accessed. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the array is accessed with an index that is greater than or equal to ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the host2rxdma array. This can be done by checking the index of the array before accessing it. For example, you can add a check to ensure that the index is less than ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a dynamically allocated array or a vector to avoid buffer overflows. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the declaration of the host2rxdma array, which is on line 14. The array is not used in the provided code snippet, but it can still be accessed and modified elsewhere
