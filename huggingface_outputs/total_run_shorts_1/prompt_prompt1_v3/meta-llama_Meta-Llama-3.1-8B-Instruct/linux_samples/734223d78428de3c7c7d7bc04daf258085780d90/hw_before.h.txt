VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `host2rxdma` array. The array is declared with a size of `ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX`, which is a macro that can be defined to a large value. However, the array is not initialized or checked for bounds before being used, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX` value is larger than the actual size of the array.
EXPLANATION: The `host2rxdma` array is declared with a size of `ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX`, which is a macro that can be defined to a large value. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `ATH11K_EXT_IRQ_GRP_NUM_MAX` value is larger than the actual size of the array. The array is not initialized or checked for bounds before being used, which makes it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `host2rxdma` array should be initialized with a fixed size that is known to be safe. Additionally, bounds checking should be added to ensure that
