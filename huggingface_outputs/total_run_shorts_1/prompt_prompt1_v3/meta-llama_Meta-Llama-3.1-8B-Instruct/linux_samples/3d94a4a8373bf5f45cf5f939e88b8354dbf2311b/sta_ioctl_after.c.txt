VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data into the country_code array.
EXPLANATION: The country_code array is defined as a 2-byte array, but the code attempts to copy 3 bytes from the country_ie array into it. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the country_ie array is not accessed beyond its valid range. Specifically, the line `memcpy(priv->adapter->country_code, &country_ie[2], 2);` should be modified to only copy 2 bytes from the country_ie array, like so: `memcpy(priv->adapter->country_code, &country_ie[2], 2);`. Additionally, the line `domain_info->country_code[0] = country_ie[2];` and `domain_info->country_code[1] = country_ie[3];` should be modified to only access the first 2 bytes of the country_ie array, like so: `domain_info->country_code[0] = country_ie[2];
