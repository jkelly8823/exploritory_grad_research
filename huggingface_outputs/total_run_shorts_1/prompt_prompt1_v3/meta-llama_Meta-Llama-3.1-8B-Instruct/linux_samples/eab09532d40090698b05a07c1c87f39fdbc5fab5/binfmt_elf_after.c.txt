VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory corruption issue due to the use of MAP_FIXED without proper validation of the address range. This can lead to a situation where the program attempts to map memory at an address that is already occupied by another mapping, resulting in a memory corruption error.
EXPLANATION: The code uses MAP_FIXED to map the ELF file into memory, but it does not properly validate the address range before doing so. This can lead to a situation where the program attempts to map memory at an address that is already occupied by another mapping, resulting in a memory corruption error. The use of MAP_FIXED without proper validation is a common mistake that can lead to security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should properly validate the address range before using MAP_FIXED. This can be done by checking if the address range is already occupied by another mapping before attempting to map the ELF file into memory. Additionally, the code should use a more secure mapping approach, such as using MAP_PRIVATE and MAP_ANONYMOUS to create a new mapping that is not shared with other mappings. This will prevent the program from attempting to map memory
