VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition when accessing the ELF file's program headers. This is because the `total_size` variable is calculated before the `load_bias` is applied, which could lead to incorrect calculations if the `load_bias` changes concurrently.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `total_size` variable is calculated before the `load_bias` is applied. This means that if the `load_bias` changes concurrently, the `total_size` calculation will be based on the old value of `load_bias`, leading to incorrect results. This could potentially lead to a race condition when accessing the ELF file's program headers.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the `total_size` calculation should be performed after the `load_bias` is applied. This can be achieved by moving the `total_size = total_mapping_size(elf_phdata, loc->elf_ex.e_phnum);` line after the `load_bias` calculation. Additionally, consider using a lock to protect the `load_bias` calculation and the `total_size` calculation to prevent concurrent access. ```c
load_bias = ELF
