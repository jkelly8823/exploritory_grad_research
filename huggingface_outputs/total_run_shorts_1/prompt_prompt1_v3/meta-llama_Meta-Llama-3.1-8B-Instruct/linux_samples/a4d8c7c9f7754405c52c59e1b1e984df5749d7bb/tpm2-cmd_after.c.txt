VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from the `buf.data` array to the `payload->key` array without checking the length of the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data is greater than the size of the `payload->key` array.
EXPLANATION: The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from the `buf.data` array to the `payload->key` array. The length of the data to be copied is `data_len - 1`, which is calculated from the `be16_to_cpup` function. However, this length is not checked against the size of the `payload->key` array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data is greater than the size of the `payload->key` array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the data to be copied against the size of the `payload->key` array before calling the `memcpy` function. This can be done by adding a simple length check, such as `if (
