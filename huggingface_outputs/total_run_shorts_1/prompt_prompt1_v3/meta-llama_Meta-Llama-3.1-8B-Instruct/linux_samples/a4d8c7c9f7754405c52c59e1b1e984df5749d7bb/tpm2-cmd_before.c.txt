VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The payload->key_len is not validated before being used to copy data into the payload->key buffer. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the be16_to_cpup function to extract the key length from the TPM buffer. However, it does not check if the extracted length is within a valid range. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious TPM buffer that contains a large key length, causing the payload->key buffer to overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the extracted key length before using it to copy data into the payload->key buffer. This can be done by checking if the length is within a valid range (e.g. 0 to TPM_DIGEST_SIZE). If the length is invalid, an error should be returned. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer function to copy data, such as memcpy_s, which can help prevent buffer overflows.  ```c
