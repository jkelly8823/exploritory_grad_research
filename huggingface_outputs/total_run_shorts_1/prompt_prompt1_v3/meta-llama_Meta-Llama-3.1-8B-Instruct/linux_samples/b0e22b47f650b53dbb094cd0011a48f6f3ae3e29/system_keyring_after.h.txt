 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a macro to redefine a function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues if the macro is not properly defined or used.
EXPLANATION: The line `#define restrict_link_by_builtin_and_secondary_trusted restrict_link_by_builtin_trusted` redefines a function using a macro. This can cause issues if the macro is not properly defined or used, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. This is a potential vulnerability because it can lead to undefined behavior or security issues if the macro is not properly defined or used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the macro should be properly defined and used. This can be achieved by ensuring that the macro is only used when necessary and that it is properly defined to avoid any potential issues. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the macro is not causing any unexpected behavior or security issues. It is also recommended to use a more secure approach, such as using a function pointer or a more explicit function definition, to avoid any potential issues with the macro.  The use of a macro to redefine a function is generally discouraged in favor
