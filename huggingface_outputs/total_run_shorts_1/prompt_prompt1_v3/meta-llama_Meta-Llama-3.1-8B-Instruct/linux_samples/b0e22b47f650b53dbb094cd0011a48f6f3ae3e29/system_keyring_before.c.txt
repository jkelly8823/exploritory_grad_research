VULNERABLE_LINES: 27-30
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The variable 'plen' is calculated as (p[2] << 8) | p[3], which is then added to 4. However, the code does not check if the resulting 'plen' is greater than the remaining bytes in the buffer 'p'. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer by crafting a malicious certificate.
EXPLANATION: The code is parsing a certificate list and calculating the length of each certificate. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the calculated length. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer by crafting a malicious certificate. The 'dodgy_cert' label is reached when the code encounters a certificate that is too short or has an invalid length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the calculated 'plen' is greater than the remaining bytes in the buffer 'p' before adding 4 to it. This can be done by adding a simple bounds check: if (plen > end - p) goto dodgy_cert;. This will prevent the buffer overflow attack. Additionally, the code should also check if
