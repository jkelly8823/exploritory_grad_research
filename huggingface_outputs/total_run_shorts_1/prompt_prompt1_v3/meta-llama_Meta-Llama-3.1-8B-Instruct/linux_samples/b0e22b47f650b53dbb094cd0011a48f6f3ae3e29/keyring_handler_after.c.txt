VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the len parameter in the uefi_blacklist_hash function.
EXPLANATION: The uefi_blacklist_hash function does not check if the len parameter is within the valid range of the data buffer. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the uefi_blacklist_hash function to ensure that the len parameter is within the valid range of the data buffer. This can be done by checking if len is less than or equal to the size of the data buffer. If len is greater than the size of the data buffer, return an error or handle the situation accordingly. For example: if (len > data_size) { return -1; } where data_size is the size of the data buffer.  Additionally, consider using a safer function like memcpy_s to copy the data into the buffer.  Also, consider using a safer function like efi_status_t efi_copy_mem to copy the data into the buffer.  This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability.  It is also recommended to use a safer function like
