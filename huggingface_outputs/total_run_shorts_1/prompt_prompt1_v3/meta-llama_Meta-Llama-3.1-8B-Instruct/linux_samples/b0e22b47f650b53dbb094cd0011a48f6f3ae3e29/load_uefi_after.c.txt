VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the code. The function kfree(dbx) is called when efi_rt_services_supported(EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE) returns false. However, the variable dbx is not initialized before this check, and it is not checked for null before the kfree call. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if dbx is null.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is a function that loads UEFI certificates. It checks if the efi_rt_services_supported function returns false for the EFI_RT_SUPPORTED_GET_VARIABLE flag. If it does, it calls kfree(dbx) without checking if dbx is null. However, dbx is not initialized before this check, so it is possible that dbx is null when kfree is called. This can lead to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if dbx is null before calling kfree on it. This can be done by adding a null check before the kfree call. For example: if (dbx!= NULL) kfree(dbx);. Additionally, dbx should be
