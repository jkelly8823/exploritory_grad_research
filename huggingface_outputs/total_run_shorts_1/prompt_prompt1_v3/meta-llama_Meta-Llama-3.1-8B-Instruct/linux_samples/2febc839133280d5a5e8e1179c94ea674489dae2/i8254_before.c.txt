VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The hrtimer_cancel function is called without checking if the timer is already cancelled. This can lead to a race condition where the timer is cancelled and then immediately restarted, resulting in unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that hrtimer_cancel returns an error code, but this error code is not checked before calling hrtimer_start_expires. If hrtimer_cancel fails, it will return an error code, but the code will still attempt to start the timer, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should check the return value of hrtimer_cancel before calling hrtimer_start_expires. If hrtimer_cancel fails, the code should not attempt to start the timer. The corrected code should look like this: if (hrtimer_cancel(timer) == 0) { hrtimer_start_expires(timer, HRTIMER_MODE_ABS); } else { /* handle error */ } .
