 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of the schedule_work() function in the rtl92c_fill_h2c_cmd() function, which is called directly in the rtl92cu_update_hal_rate_mask() function. This can lead to a "scheduled while atomic" error.
EXPLANATION: The schedule_work() function is used to schedule a work item to be executed in the future. However, in this case, it is being called directly in the rtl92cu_update_hal_rate_mask() function, which can lead to a race condition. The rtl92c_fill_h2c_cmd() function performs USB I/O, which is an atomic operation, and calling schedule_work() directly in this function can result in a "scheduled while atomic" error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the schedule_work() function should be called in a separate thread or using a lock to prevent the race condition. The rtl92c_fill_h2c_cmd() function should be modified to use a lock or a separate thread to perform the USB I/O operation. Additionally, the rtl92cu_update_hal_rate_mask() function should be modified to
