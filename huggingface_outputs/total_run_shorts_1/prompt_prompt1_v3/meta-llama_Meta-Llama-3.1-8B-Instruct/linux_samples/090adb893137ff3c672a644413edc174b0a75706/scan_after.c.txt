VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the `memcpy` function without bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from one buffer to another. However, it does not perform any bounds checking, which means that if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow. In this case, the `sizeof` operator is used to determine the size of the destination buffer, but it does not account for any potential padding or alignment issues. This can lead to a situation where the source buffer is copied beyond the bounds of the destination buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function like `memcpy_s` or `strncpy` that performs bounds checking. Alternatively, the code can use a manual loop to copy the data, which allows for more control over the copying process and can help prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the code should consider using a buffer size that is a multiple of the size of the
