VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of sprintf() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The sprintf() function is used to format strings without any bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflows if the formatted string exceeds the buffer size. In this case, the buffer size is not explicitly defined, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like snprintf() with bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows. For example, replace the line "p += sprintf(p, "bss_mode=\"%s\"\n", bss_modes[info.bss_mode]);" with "p += snprintf(p, item_size(info.bss_mode), "bss_mode=\"%s\"\n", bss_modes[info.bss_mode]);". Also, consider using a safer function like asprintf() which allocates the buffer size automatically. Additionally, consider using a format string that is not vulnerable to buffer overflows, such as using a fixed-size buffer and copying the formatted string into it.
