VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to a mismatch between the source and destination buffer sizes in the memcpy function calls.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from one buffer to another. However, in the second memcpy call, the destination buffer size is specified as sizeof(cmd->channels_2), which is incorrect. It should be sizeof(cmd->channels_5) instead. This mismatch can lead to a buffer overflow, where more data is written to the destination buffer than it can hold, potentially causing undefined behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, change the second memcpy call to use the correct destination buffer size, sizeof(cmd->channels_5). The corrected code should look like this: memcpy(cmd->channels_5, cmd_channels->channels_5, sizeof(cmd->channels_5));. This ensures that the correct amount of data is copied to the destination buffer, preventing a potential buffer overflow.  Additionally, consider using a safer function like memcpy_s or strncpy to prevent buffer overflows in the future.  It is also a good practice to check the sizes of the source and destination buffers before copying data to
