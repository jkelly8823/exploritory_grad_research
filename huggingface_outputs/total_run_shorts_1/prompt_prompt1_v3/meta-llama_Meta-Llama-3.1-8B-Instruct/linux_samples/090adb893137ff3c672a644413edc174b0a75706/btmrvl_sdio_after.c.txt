VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking in the firmware loading mechanism.
EXPLANATION: The MODULE_FIRMWARE macro is used to specify firmware files that should be loaded by the driver. However, there is no bounds checking to ensure that the firmware files are not larger than the buffer allocated for them. This can lead to a buffer overflow if a malicious firmware file is loaded, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the driver should implement bounds checking to ensure that the firmware files are not larger than the buffer allocated for them. This can be done by checking the size of the firmware file before loading it, and ensuring that it does not exceed the buffer size. Additionally, the driver should consider using a more secure method of loading firmware, such as using a secure boot mechanism.
