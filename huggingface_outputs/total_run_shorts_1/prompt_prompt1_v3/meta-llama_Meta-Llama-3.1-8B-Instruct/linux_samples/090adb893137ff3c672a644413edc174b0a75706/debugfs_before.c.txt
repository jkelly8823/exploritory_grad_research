VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of sprintf() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The sprintf() function is used to format strings without any bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflows if the formatted string exceeds the buffer size. In this case, the buffer size is not explicitly defined, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like snprintf() with bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows. For example, replace the line "p += sprintf(p, "driver_version = %s", fmt);" with "p += snprintf(p, MAX_SIZE, "driver_version = %s", fmt);" where MAX_SIZE is the maximum size of the buffer. Also, consider using a safer function like asprintf() which automatically handles buffer allocation and bounds checking. Additionally, consider using a format string that is not vulnerable to format string attacks. For example, use a format string that does not include user input like "%s". Instead, use a format string that is generated at compile time, like "driver_version = %s". This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious code through the format string.  Also
