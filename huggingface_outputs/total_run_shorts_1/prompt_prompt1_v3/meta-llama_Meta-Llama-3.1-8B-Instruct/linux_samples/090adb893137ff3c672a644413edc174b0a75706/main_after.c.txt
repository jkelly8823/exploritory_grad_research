 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple loop that iterates over an array of error messages and prints them if they are not empty. The loop is followed by a call to a function to print firmware help text and a goto statement to exit the function. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix any vulnerabilities.  The goto statement is used to exit the function early, which is a common practice in C programming. However, it is worth noting that the use of goto statements can make the code more difficult to understand and debug, and it is generally considered better practice to use structured control flow instead.  Nevertheless, in this case, the use of goto does not appear to introduce any security vulnerabilities.  The code snippet is well-structured and easy to follow, and the use of goto does not seem to be necessary in this case.  It would be better to use a return statement instead
