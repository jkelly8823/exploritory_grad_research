VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `io` pointer is used after it has been unmapped in the `out` block.
EXPLANATION: The `io` pointer is unmapped in the `out` block when `bar == PCI_ROM_RESOURCE`. However, the `io` pointer is still used in the `out` block when `res->flags & IORESOURCE_MEM` is true. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the memory pointed to by `io` has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `io` pointer should be checked for null before using it in the `out` block. Additionally, the `io` pointer should be unmapped before the `out` block if it has not already been unmapped. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
if (bar == PCI_ROM_RESOURCE)
	pci_unmap_rom(pdev, io);
if (res->flags & IORESOURCE_MEM)
	up_read(&vdev->memory_lock);
if (io) {
	// Use the io pointer here
}
``` 
```
