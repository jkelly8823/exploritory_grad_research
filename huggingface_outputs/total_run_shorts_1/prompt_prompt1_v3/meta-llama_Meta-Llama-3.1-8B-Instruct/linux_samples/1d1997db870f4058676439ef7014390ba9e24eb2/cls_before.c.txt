VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `match` pointer is used after it has been freed in the `err_delete` label.
EXPLANATION: The `match` pointer is allocated in the `if (!match)` block and then used in the following lines. However, if an error occurs in the `err_delete` label, the `match` pointer is freed, but the code still attempts to use it. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `match` pointer should be freed before the `err_delete` label is reached. Alternatively, the code can be modified to check if the `match` pointer is null before using it. Additionally, the `match` pointer should be set to null after it is freed to prevent further use. The corrected code should look like this: `if (!match) {... } else {... }` to ensure that the `match` pointer is not used after it has been freed.
