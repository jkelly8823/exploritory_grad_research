VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `addr` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `addr` variable is incremented by `pbuf->len` without checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed value. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `pbuf->len` is larger than the maximum allowed value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the `addr` variable to prevent buffer overflows. For example, use the `min` function to ensure that `addr` does not exceed the maximum allowed value. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as `size_t`, to represent the address. ```c
buf->addr = min_t(__u64, addr, MAX_ADDR);
``` ```c
```c
struct io_buffer {
	struct list_head list;
	__u64 addr;
	__u32 len;
	__u16 bid;
};

struct io_restriction {
			break;

		buf->addr = addr;
		buf->len = min_t(__u32, pbuf->len, MAX_RW_COUNT);
		buf->bid = bid;
		addr +=
