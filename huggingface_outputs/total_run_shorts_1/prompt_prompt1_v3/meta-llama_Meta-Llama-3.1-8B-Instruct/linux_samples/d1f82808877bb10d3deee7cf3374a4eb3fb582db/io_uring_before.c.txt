VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the addr variable.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is attempting to update the addr variable to point to the next buffer location. However, it does not check if the addr variable has exceeded the maximum allowed value, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to access or modify sensitive data outside the intended buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the addr variable does not exceed the maximum allowed value. This can be done by checking if addr is within the valid range before updating it. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a pointer, to represent the buffer address.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the bid variable.
EXPLANANATION: The code snippet is attempting to update the bid variable to point to the next buffer location. However, it does not check if the bid variable has exceeded the maximum allowed value, which
