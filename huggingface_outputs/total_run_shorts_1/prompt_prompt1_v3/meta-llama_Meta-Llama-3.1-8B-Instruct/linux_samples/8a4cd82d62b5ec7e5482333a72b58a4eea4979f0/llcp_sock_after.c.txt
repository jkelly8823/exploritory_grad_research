VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A resource leak vulnerability is present due to the lack of a proper cleanup mechanism in the error handling path.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains an error handling path where resources are not properly cleaned up in case of an error. Specifically, in the case where `llcp_sock->ssap` is `LLCP_SAP_MAX`, the `nfc_llcp_local_put(llcp_sock->local)` call is made, but the `nfc_put_device(dev)` call is still executed, potentially leading to a resource leak. This is because the `goto put_dev` statement skips the cleanup of the `local` resource.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that all resources are properly cleaned up in the error handling path. This can be achieved by removing the `goto put_dev` statement and instead executing the cleanup code for all resources, including `local`, in the error handling path. Additionally, consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as a `try`-`catch` block, to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up in case of an error.  |
