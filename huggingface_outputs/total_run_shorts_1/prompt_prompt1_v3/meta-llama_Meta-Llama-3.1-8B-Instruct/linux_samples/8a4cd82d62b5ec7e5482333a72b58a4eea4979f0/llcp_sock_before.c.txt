VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists due to the lack of error checking for the nfc_llcp_local_get function.
EXPLANATION: The nfc_llcp_local_get function is called without any error checking. If this function returns a null pointer, the subsequent operations on llcp_sock->local will result in a null pointer dereference. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add error checking for the nfc_llcp_local_get function to ensure that it returns a valid pointer before proceeding. This can be done by checking if the returned pointer is null before assigning it to llcp_sock->local. If the pointer is null, handle the error accordingly. For example: if (nfc_llcp_local_get(local) == NULL) { /* handle error */ } else { llcp_sock->local = nfc_llcp_local_get(local); } .
