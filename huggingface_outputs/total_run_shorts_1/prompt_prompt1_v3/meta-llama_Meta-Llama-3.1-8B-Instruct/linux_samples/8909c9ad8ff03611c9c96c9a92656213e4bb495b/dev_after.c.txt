VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the request_module function. This function can lead to a recursive module loading, which can cause a system crash or hang.
EXPLANATION: The request_module function is used to load a kernel module dynamically. However, if the module being loaded has a dependency on another module that is also being loaded, it can lead to a recursive loading of modules, causing a system crash or hang. This is a known issue in the Linux kernel and has been reported in the past.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more secure method of loading kernel modules, such as using the kernel's module loading API. Additionally, the code should be modified to check for and prevent recursive module loading. This can be done by keeping track of the modules that are currently being loaded and checking if a module is already being loaded before attempting to load it. The code should also be modified to handle the case where a module fails to load, to prevent a system crash or hang.
