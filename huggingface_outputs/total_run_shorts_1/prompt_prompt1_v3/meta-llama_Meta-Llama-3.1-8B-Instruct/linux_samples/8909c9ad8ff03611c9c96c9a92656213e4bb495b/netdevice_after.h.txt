VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability due to the use of the va_args macro in the netdev_info function.
EXPLANATION: The netdev_info function uses the va_args macro to handle variable arguments, but it does not properly validate the format string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by crafting a format string that includes a %n directive, which can be used to write data to arbitrary memory locations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the netdev_info function should be modified to use a safer alternative to va_args, such as the __builtin_va_start and __builtin_va_end macros. Additionally, the format string should be validated to prevent any malicious code from being injected. The netdev_dbg function should also be modified to use a safer alternative to va_args. The MODULE_ALIAS_NETDEV macro should be modified to use a safer alternative to the va_args macro. The netdev_printk function should be modified to use a safer alternative to va_args. The netdev_printk function should be validated to prevent any malicious code from being injected. The netdev_printk function should be modified to use a safer alternative to
