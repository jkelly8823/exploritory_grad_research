VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the arch_dup_mmap function. This is because the function accesses the oldmm->context.asce_limit variable after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The arch_dup_mmap function takes two parameters, oldmm and mm. The function checks if the asce_limit of the oldmm is less than the asce_limit of the mm. If this condition is true, it calls the crst_table_downgrade function. However, the crst_table_downgrade function takes the mm and the oldmm->context.asce_limit as parameters. This means that the oldmm->context.asce_limit is accessed after it has been freed. This is a potential use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the crst_table_downgrade function should be called with the mm and the asce_limit of the mm instead of the oldmm->context.asce_limit. This can be achieved by changing the line crst_table_downgrade(mm, oldmm->context.asce_limit); to crst_table_downgrade(mm, mm->context.asce_limit);. This will ensure that the as
