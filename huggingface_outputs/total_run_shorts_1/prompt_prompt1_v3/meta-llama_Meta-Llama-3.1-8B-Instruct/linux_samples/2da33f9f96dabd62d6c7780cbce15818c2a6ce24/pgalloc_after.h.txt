VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The `pgd_free` function does not properly handle the case where `pgd` is a pointer to a page that has already been freed. This can lead to a use-after-free bug when the `pgtable_pmd_page_dtor` function is called on a freed page.
EXPLANATION: The `pgd_free` function checks if `mm->context.asce_limit` is equal to `(1UL << 31)` before calling `pgtable_pmd_page_dtor` on the `pgd` pointer. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a use-after-free bug. If `pgd` is a pointer to a page that has already been freed, calling `pgtable_pmd_page_dtor` on it will result in undefined behavior. This is because the page has already been deallocated and its contents are no longer valid.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `pgd_free` function should check if the `pgd` pointer is still valid before calling `pgtable_pmd_page_dtor` on it. This can be
