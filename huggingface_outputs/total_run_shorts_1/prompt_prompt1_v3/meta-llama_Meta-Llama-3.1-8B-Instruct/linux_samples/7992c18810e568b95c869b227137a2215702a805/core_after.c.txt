VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of validation of the 'len' variable before passing it to the 'hidp_process_report' function.
EXPLANATION: The 'len' variable is not validated to ensure it does not exceed the maximum buffer size. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by passing a large value for 'len', leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate the 'len' variable to ensure it does not exceed the maximum buffer size. This can be done by adding a check before passing 'len' to the 'hidp_process_report' function. For example: if (len > HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) len = HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE; else if (len < 0) len = 0;. Additionally, consider using a safer function to copy the data, such as'memcpy_s' or'strncpy_s', to prevent buffer overflows.  The'memcpy_s' function is a safer version of'memcpy' that prevents buffer overflows by checking the size of the destination buffer before copying data. The'strncpy_s' function is a safer version of'strncpy' that
