VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential data leak due to the use of the `cpu_matches` function without proper validation of the input parameter `which`.
EXPLANATION: The `cpu_matches` function is called with the value of `NO_MELTDOWN`, which is a bitfield defined earlier in the code. However, the function does not perform any validation on the input parameter, which could potentially lead to a data leak if an attacker is able to manipulate the value of `which`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `cpu_matches` function should be modified to perform proper validation on the input parameter `which`. This could be done by checking if the value is within a valid range or by using a more robust validation mechanism. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the `cpu_matches` function is not called with an invalid or malicious value.
