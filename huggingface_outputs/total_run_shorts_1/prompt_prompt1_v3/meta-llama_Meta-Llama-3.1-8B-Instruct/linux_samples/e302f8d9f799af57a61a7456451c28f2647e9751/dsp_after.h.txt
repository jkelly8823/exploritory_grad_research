 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple implementation of getter and setter functions for a private data field within a struct. The functions are marked as static inline, indicating they are intended for internal use within the current translation unit. The use of a pointer to a struct as an argument to the functions suggests that the code is designed to be flexible and allow for different types of data to be stored. The code does not appear to contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and well-written. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and consider potential edge cases and error handling scenarios. Additionally, the use of the IS_ENABLED macro suggests that the code is intended to be compiled conditionally, which may affect the security of the code in certain scenarios. It would be a good idea to review the code in the context of the larger project and consider any potential security implications.  Please note that this code snippet is a part of a larger project and might be vulnerable in the
