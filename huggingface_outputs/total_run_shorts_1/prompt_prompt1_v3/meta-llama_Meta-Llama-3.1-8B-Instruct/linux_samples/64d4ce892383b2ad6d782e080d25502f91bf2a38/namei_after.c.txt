VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function ext4_read_dirblock() is called with the variable lblock which is calculated from the variable offset. However, the variable offset is not validated before being used to calculate lblock. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of offset is larger than the maximum allowed value for lblock.
EXPLANATION: The function ext4_read_dirblock() is called with the variable lblock which is calculated from the variable offset. The variable offset is not validated before being used to calculate lblock. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the value of offset is larger than the maximum allowed value for lblock. The function ext4_read_dirblock() may return an error if the block is not found, but it does not check if the block is within the valid range. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the block is not found.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should validate the variable
