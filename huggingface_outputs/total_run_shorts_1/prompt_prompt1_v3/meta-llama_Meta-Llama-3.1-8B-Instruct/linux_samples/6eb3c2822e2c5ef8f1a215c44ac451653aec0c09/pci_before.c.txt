VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential race condition exists due to the lack of synchronization between the spin lock and the cancel_work_sync function.
EXPLANATION: The spin lock is used to protect the access to the ppsc->rfchange_inprogress variable, but the cancel_work_sync function is not protected by the same lock. This can lead to a situation where the work is cancelled while the lock is held, causing unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the cancel_work_sync function should be called within the spin lock, or the spin lock should be released before calling the cancel_work_sync function. Additionally, consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex, to protect access to shared variables.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential race condition exists due to the lack of synchronization between the spin lock and the hw_disable function.
EXPLANANATION: The spin lock is used to protect the access to the ppsc->rfchange_inprogress variable, but the hw_disable function is not protected by the same lock. This can lead to a situation where the hardware is
