VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The variable `limit` is calculated based on `sk->sk_sndbuf` and `SKB_TRUESIZE(GSO_MAX_SIZE)`, but it does not account for the possibility of a large `skb` being passed to the function. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the `skb` is larger than the calculated `limit`.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the `sk_wmem_queued` is greater than the `limit` and if the `skb` is not in the retransmit queue. However, it does not check if the `skb` is larger than the `limit`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if a large `skb` is passed to the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the `skb` is larger than the `limit` before accessing it. This can be done by adding a check `if (skb->len > limit)` before the code that accesses the `skb`. Additionally, the code should consider using a more secure way to calculate the `limit`, such as using a fixed buffer
