VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `pdu->StructureSize2` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `pdu->StructureSize2` variable is assigned a value of 0 when the `len` variable is less than `pdu_size`, but it is not checked if this value is within the valid range for the `StructureSize2` field. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `StructureSize2` field is accessed later in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the `pdu->StructureSize2` variable is within the valid range for the `StructureSize2` field. This can be done by checking if the value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the maximum allowed value for the `StructureSize2` field. If the value is outside this range, an error should be returned or an exception should be thrown. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as `uint32_t`, to store the `StructureSize2` field to prevent overflows.  ```c
