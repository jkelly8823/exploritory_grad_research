VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The condition `if (len < pdu_size)` checks if the length of the packet is less than the size of the packet. However, the code does not check if the length of the packet is greater than the size of the packet, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the length of the packet is less than the size of the packet, but it does not check if the length of the packet is greater than the size of the packet. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the packet is greater than the size of the packet. A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it is designed to hold, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the length of the packet is greater than the size of the packet and return an error if it is. The corrected code should be: `if (len > pdu_size) { return 1; }`. Additionally, the code should also check if the length of the packet is less than
