VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines a macro `memcpy` that is not thread-safe. This is because the macro is not properly synchronized, which can lead to data corruption and crashes in multi-threaded environments.
EXPLANATION: The code defines a macro `memcpy` that is not thread-safe. This is because the macro is not properly synchronized, which can lead to data corruption and crashes in multi-threaded environments. The macro is defined as `__inline_memcpy((dst), (src), (len))`, which is not a thread-safe function. In a multi-threaded environment, multiple threads may call this function simultaneously, leading to data corruption and crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a thread-safe function for the `memcpy` macro. One possible solution is to use the `memcpy_mcsafe_unrolled` function, which is defined as `__must_check int memcpy_mcsafe_unrolled(void *dst, const void *src, size_t cnt);`. This function is thread-safe and can be used to replace the `memcpy` macro. Additionally, the code should ensure that the `memcpy_mcsafe_un
