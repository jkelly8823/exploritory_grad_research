VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `size_t` type for the `n` parameter, which can be used to overflow the buffer when copying data.
EXPLANATION: The `size_t` type is an unsigned integer type that can represent the size of any object in bytes. However, when used as the size parameter in the `memcpy` function, it can be used to overflow the buffer if the value of `n` is larger than the actual size of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `size_t` type should be replaced with a signed integer type, such as `ssize_t`, to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the value of `n` is validated and checked against the actual size of the buffer before copying data. The `CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE` check should also be removed or modified to prevent the use of the `size_t` type in this context.
