 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple kernel boot function. It prints a message to the console and returns an output. The `fortify_panic` function is a placeholder for a panic function, but it does not contain any vulnerabilities. The `error` function is not defined in this snippet, but it is likely a function that prints an error message to the console.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure. However, it would be a good idea to define the `error` function and ensure that it is properly implemented to handle errors in the kernel. Additionally, it would be a good idea to add more robust error handling to the kernel boot function to handle any potential errors that may occur during boot.  ```bash
