VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a stack overflow attack. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly check the size of the stack before allocating memory to it. This can lead to a stack overflow if the size of the stack is exceeded.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the size of the stack is greater than the current stack limit divided by 4. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a stack overflow. The stack limit is in bytes, but the size of the stack is in pages. Therefore, the check is not accurate and can lead to a stack overflow if the size of the stack is exceeded.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the stack in bytes instead of pages. This can be done by multiplying the size of the stack by the page size. Additionally, the code should also check if the size of the stack is greater than the current stack limit. If it is, the code should return an error or handle the situation accordingly. The corrected code should look like this: if (size > ACCESS_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur)) {
