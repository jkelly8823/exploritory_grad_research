VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the size of the GDT.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet sets the size of the IDT and GDT using the `sregs->idt.limit` and `sregs->gdt.limit` variables respectively. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on these values, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the values are larger than expected. This could result in unexpected behavior or even a crash of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the `sregs->idt.limit` and `sregs->gdt.limit` variables before setting the size of the IDT and GDT. This can be done by checking if the values are within a valid range, and if not, returning an error or taking other appropriate action. For example: if (sregs->idt.limit > MAX_IDT_SIZE || sregs->gdt.limit > MAX_GDT_SIZE) { return -EINVAL; } where MAX_IDT_SIZE and MAX_GDT_SIZE are defined constants representing the maximum allowed sizes for
