VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the arch_dup_mmap function. This is because the function accesses the oldmm->context.asce_limit variable after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The arch_dup_mmap function takes two arguments, oldmm and mm. The function checks if the asce_limit of the oldmm is less than the asce_limit of the mm. If this condition is true, it calls the crst_table_downgrade function. However, the crst_table_downgrade function takes the mm and the oldmm->context.asce_limit as arguments. This means that the oldmm->context.asce_limit is accessed after the oldmm has been freed. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the crst_table_downgrade function should be called before the oldmm is freed. Alternatively, the oldmm->context.asce_limit should be copied to a local variable before the oldmm is freed, and this local variable should be used in the crst_table_downgrade function. This will ensure that the oldmm->context.asce_limit is not accessed after it
