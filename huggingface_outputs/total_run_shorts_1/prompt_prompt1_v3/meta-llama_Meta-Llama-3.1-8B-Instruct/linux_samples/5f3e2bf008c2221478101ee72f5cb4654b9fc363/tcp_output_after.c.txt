VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the MSS is reduced to a value less than the minimum MSS specified by the system. This is a potential vulnerability because it could allow an attacker to exploit the system by sending packets that are too large, potentially causing the system to crash or become unstable.
EXPLANATION: The code calculates the MSS by subtracting the length of the TCP options header from the current MSS, and then reserves room for the full set of TCP options and 8 bytes of data. However, it does not check if the resulting MSS is less than the minimum MSS specified by the system. This could potentially allow an attacker to send packets that are too large, causing the system to crash or become unstable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the calculated MSS is less than the minimum MSS specified by the system, and if so, set the MSS to the minimum value. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check the condition and set the MSS accordingly. For example: if (mss_now < sock_net(sk)->ipv4.sysctl_tcp_min_snd_mss) mss_now =
