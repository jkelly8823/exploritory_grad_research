VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the read8 function which does not perform bounds checking on the size variable.
EXPLANATION: The read8 function reads 8 bytes from the pevent variable, but the size variable is not checked to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size variable should be checked to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size before calling the read8 function. This can be done by adding a simple bounds check, such as size <= buffer_size. Additionally, consider using a safer function such as readn which performs bounds checking.
