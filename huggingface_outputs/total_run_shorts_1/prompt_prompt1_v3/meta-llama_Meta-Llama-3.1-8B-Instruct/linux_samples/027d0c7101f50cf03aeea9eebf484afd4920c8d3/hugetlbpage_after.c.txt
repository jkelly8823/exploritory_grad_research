 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If pmdp is null, the code will attempt to access memory at address 0, leading to a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if pmdp is null after allocating memory for it, but it does not check if pmdp is null before using it. This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check if pmdp is null before using it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the WARN_ON statement. For example: if (pmdp!= NULL) { WARN_ON(addr & (sz - 1)); } else { /* handle null pointer */ } ``` VULNERABLE: YES
