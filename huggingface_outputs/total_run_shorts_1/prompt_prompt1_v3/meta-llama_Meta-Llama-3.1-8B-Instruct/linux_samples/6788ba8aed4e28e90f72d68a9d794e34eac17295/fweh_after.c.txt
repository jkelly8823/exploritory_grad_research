VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect usage of brcmf_fweh_event_name function.
EXPLANATION: The brcmf_fweh_event_name function is called with two arguments, event->code and event->code. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the event->code is large, as it will be written to the buffer twice. Additionally, the function is called with a variable number of arguments, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the number of arguments is not correctly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The brcmf_fweh_event_name function should be called with a single argument, event->code, and the other arguments should be passed separately to avoid potential buffer overflows. The function should also be checked to ensure it correctly handles a variable number of arguments. Alternatively, the function could be modified to take a variable number of arguments and handle them correctly.
