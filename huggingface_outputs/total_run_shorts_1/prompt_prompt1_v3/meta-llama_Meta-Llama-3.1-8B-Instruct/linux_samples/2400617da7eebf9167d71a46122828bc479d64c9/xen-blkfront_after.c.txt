 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the lack of proper cleanup of the indirect pages when the backend is not trusted.
EXPLANATION: In the code snippet, when the backend is not trusted (i.e., `xen_blkif_trusted` is false), the indirect pages are not properly cleaned up. This can lead to a memory leak as the indirect pages are not freed when they are no longer needed. The issue arises in the `xen_translate_vdev` function where the indirect pages are not freed when the backend is not trusted.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly clean up the indirect pages when the backend is not trusted. This can be achieved by adding a check in the `xen_translate_vdev` function to free the indirect pages when the backend is not trusted. The corrected code should look like this: ```c
if (!info->bounce &&!xen_blkif_trusted) {
	list_for_each_entry_safe(indirect_page, n, &rinfo->indirect_pages, lru) {
		list_del(&indirect_page->lru);
