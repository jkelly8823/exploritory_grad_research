VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of the 'dbg_kdb_mode' variable after it has been reassigned.
EXPLANATION: The 'dbg_kdb_mode' variable is reassigned to 1 in the 'if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KGDB_KDB))' block, but it is still used in the 'continue' statement outside of this block. This could potentially lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the 'dbg_kdb_mode' variable is freed or reassigned before it is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'dbg_kdb_mode' variable should be reassigned to a temporary variable within the 'if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KGDB_KDB))' block, and then used in the 'continue' statement. Alternatively, the 'continue' statement could be moved inside the 'if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KGDB_KDB))' block to avoid the use of the reassigned variable.  ```bash
if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KGDB_KDB)) {
    int temp = dbg_kdb_mode;
    dbg_kdb_mode = 1;
    continue;
