 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: error_decode:error_no_ctx
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a double free vulnerability. The function x509_free_certificate(cert) is called in two different error paths, error_decode and error_no_ctx, which can lead to a double free of the cert object.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be part of a function that handles errors in a certificate verification process. In the error_decode path, the function kfree(cert->pub->key) is called, which frees the memory allocated for the key. However, in the error_no_ctx path, the function x509_free_certificate(cert) is called, which also frees the memory allocated for the cert object. This can lead to a double free vulnerability, where the memory is freed twice, causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be refactored to ensure that the memory is freed only once. This can be achieved by removing the kfree(cert->pub->key) call in the error_decode path and only calling x509_free_certificate(cert) in the error_no_ctx path. Additionally, consider using a more robust error handling mechanism to prevent such vulnerabilities in the future.
