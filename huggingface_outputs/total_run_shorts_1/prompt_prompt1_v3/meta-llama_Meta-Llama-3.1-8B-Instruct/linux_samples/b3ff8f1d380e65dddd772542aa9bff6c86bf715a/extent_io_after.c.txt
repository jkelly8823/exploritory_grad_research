VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-24
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the fs_info->fs_state is not set to BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR, but the fs is still in an error state. This is because the fs_state is not a bitfield, but a set of flags, and the test_bit function is used to check if a specific flag is set. However, the code does not check if the fs_state is NULL before calling test_bit on it.
