 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a function that initializes the shadow EPT MMU. It calls several functions to update permission bitmasks and reset RSVDS and EPT shadow zero bits masks. The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro is used to export the function as a GPL symbol. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure.  The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro is used to export the function as a GPL symbol, which is a common practice in the Linux kernel. The function calls other functions to perform specific tasks, and there is no indication of any potential vulnerabilities.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and secure.  Additionally, the use of the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro may have implications for the licensing of the code.  It is recommended to review the Linux kernel documentation and guidelines for using this macro.  It is also recommended to review the code and ensure that it is correct and secure.
