VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the execution of blk_queue_flush and the creation of a new thread. The thread creation and execution may occur concurrently with the flush operation, potentially leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the thread creation and execution are not properly synchronized with the flush operation. The mutex lock is acquired after the thread creation, but it is not guaranteed that the thread will not have started executing before the lock is acquired. This can lead to a situation where the thread attempts to access the queue while it is being flushed, resulting in a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the mutex lock should be acquired before the thread creation and execution. This can be achieved by moving the mutex_lock call to before the thread creation. Additionally, it is recommended to use a lock that is specific to the queue being flushed, rather than a global lock like nbd->tx_lock. This will help to prevent other threads from accessing the queue while it is being flushed. The corrected code should look like this: mutex_lock(&nbd->tx_lock); thread = kthread_create(nbd_thread, nbd,
