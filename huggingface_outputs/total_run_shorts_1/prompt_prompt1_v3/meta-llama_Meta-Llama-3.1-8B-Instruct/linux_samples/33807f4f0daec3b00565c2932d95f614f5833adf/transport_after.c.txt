VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the smb_send_rqst function. The function checks if the send length matches the calculated length, but it does not check if the send length is within the bounds of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The function calculates the send length using the rqst_len function, which sums up the lengths of the iov array and the page array. However, it does not check if the send length is within the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the send length is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should check if the send length is within the bounds of the buffer before sending the data. This can be done by checking if the send length is less than or equal to the buffer size. If it is not, the function should return an error. Additionally, the function should also check if the send length is a multiple of the page size to prevent partial page writes.
