 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the calculation of `EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE + ei->i_extra_isize`.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the sum of `EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE` and `ei->i_extra_isize` is greater than `EXT4_INODE_SIZE(inode->i_sb)`, but it does not check if the sum itself can overflow. If `ei->i_extra_isize` is a large value, the sum can exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type of `EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE`, leading to an incorrect result.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that the sum of `EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE` and `ei->i_extra_isize` does not overflow. This can be done by checking if the sum is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the data type of `EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE`. If the sum is greater than the maximum value, return an error or handle the situation accordingly. For example: `if ((unsigned long)EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE
