VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential integer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The issue arises from the fact that the expression `ps->next_free + 1` is not checked for overflow before being used in a multiplication operation. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances of potential integer overflow vulnerabilities. The first instance occurs in the `skip_metadata` function where the expression `ps->exceptions_per_area + 1` is used to calculate the `stride` variable. The second instance occurs in the `get_info` function where the expression `ps->next_free + 1` is used to calculate the new value of `ps->next_free`. In both cases, the expressions are not checked for overflow before being used in a multiplication operation, which can lead to incorrect results and potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix the integer overflow vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for overflow before performing the multiplication operation. This can be achieved by using a safe multiplication function or by checking the values of `ps->exceptions_per_area
