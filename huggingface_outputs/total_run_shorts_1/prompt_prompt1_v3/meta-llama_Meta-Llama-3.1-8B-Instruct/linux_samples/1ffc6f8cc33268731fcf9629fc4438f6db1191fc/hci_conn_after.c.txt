VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the use of the bacmp function without checking the length of the input strings. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious BD ADDR that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The bacmp function is used to compare the BD ADDR of the local device with the destination BD ADDR. However, the bacmp function does not check the length of the input strings, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input strings are too long. This is a potential vulnerability because an attacker could craft a malicious BD ADDR that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input strings before passing them to the bacmp function. This can be done by using the strlen function to get the length of the input strings and then checking if the length is within the allowed range. If the length is not within the allowed range, an error should be returned. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer function to compare the BD ADDR, such as the memcmp function, which does not have the
