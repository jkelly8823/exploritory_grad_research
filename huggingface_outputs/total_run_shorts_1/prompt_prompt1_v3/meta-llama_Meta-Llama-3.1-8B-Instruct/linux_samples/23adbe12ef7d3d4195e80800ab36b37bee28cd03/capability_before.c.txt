VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function inode_capable() does not properly validate the input parameter cap. It does not check if the capability is within the valid range. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access.
EXPLANATION: The function inode_capable() takes an integer parameter cap, which represents a capability. However, it does not check if this capability is within the valid range. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access if an attacker passes an invalid capability value. The function ns_capable() expects a capability within the range of 0 to CAP_LAST_CAP, but the function inode_capable() does not perform this check.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function inode_capable() should be modified to check if the capability is within the valid range before passing it to the function ns_capable(). This can be done by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function: if (cap < 0 || cap > CAP_LAST_CAP) return false;. This will prevent potential buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles invalid capability values.  The
