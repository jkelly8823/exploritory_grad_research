VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 6-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a race condition in the chown and chgrp operations. The checks for the capability to perform these operations are not atomic with the checks for the group membership, allowing a malicious user to exploit this vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the checks for the capability to perform the chown and chgrp operations are not atomic with the checks for the group membership. This allows a malicious user to exploit this vulnerability by changing their group membership between the two checks, thereby gaining unauthorized access to perform these operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the checks for the capability to perform the chown and chgrp operations should be atomic with the checks for the group membership. This can be achieved by using a single check that combines both conditions, or by using a lock to ensure that the checks are performed in a consistent manner. For example, the following code snippet demonstrates a possible fix: if ((ia_valid & ATTR_UID) && (!uid_eq(current_fsuid(), inode->i_uid) ||!uid_eq(attr->ia_uid, inode->i_uid)) &&!cap
