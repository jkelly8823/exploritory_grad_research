VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of an array of fixed size (3) to store the number of instructions.
EXPLANATION: The code declares an array of size 3 to store the number of instructions, but it does not check if the actual number of instructions exceeds this size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of instructions is greater than 3, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized data, such as a vector or a linked list. Additionally, the code should include bounds checking to ensure that the number of instructions does not exceed the allocated size. For example, the code could use a function like `malloc` to allocate memory for the array based on the actual number of instructions, and then check if the allocation was successful before using the array. ```c
unsigned int* instrs = malloc(num_instructions * sizeof(unsigned int));
if (instrs == NULL) {
    // handle allocation failure
}
``` ```c
