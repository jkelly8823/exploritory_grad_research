VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `instrs` array is not checked for its bounds before being used to store and retrieve values. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `types` parameter is not properly validated.
EXPLANATION: The `instrs` array is declared with a fixed size of 3, but it is used to store values based on the `types` parameter. If the `types` parameter is not properly validated, it can lead to an out-of-bounds access, causing a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `types` parameter to ensure it does not exceed the bounds of the `instrs` array. This can be done by checking the value of `types` before using it to index the `instrs` array. Additionally, consider using a dynamically-sized array or a data structure
