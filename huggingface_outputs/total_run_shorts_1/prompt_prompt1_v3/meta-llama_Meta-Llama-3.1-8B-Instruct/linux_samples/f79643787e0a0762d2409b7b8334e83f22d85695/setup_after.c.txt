RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any fixes.  Please note that this analysis is limited to the provided code snippet and may not cover potential vulnerabilities in the surrounding code or system.  Further review and analysis may be necessary to ensure the overall security of the system.  It is also worth noting that the code snippet does not contain any user input or data processing, which reduces the risk of common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.  However, the code does contain function calls and conditional statements, which could potentially be exploited if they are not properly validated or sanitized.
