VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. The variable "lri" is used without being checked for null before being passed to the "emit_lri" function.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the "lri" variable without checking if it is null before passing it to the "emit_lri" function. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if "lri" is null. The "HAS_POOLED_EU" check is not sufficient to prevent this issue, as it only checks if the engine has pooled EU, but does not check if "lri" is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check if "lri" is null before passing it to the "emit_lri" function. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the function call. For example: if (lri!= NULL) { emit_lri(batch, lri, ARRAY_SIZE(lri)); } else { /* handle null case */ }. This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure that the code is safe to run.  The "HAS_POOLED_E
