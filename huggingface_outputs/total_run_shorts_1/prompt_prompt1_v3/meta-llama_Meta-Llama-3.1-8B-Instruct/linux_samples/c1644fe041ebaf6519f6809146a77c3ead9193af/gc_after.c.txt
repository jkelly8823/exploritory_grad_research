VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A memory leak is possible due to the use of a static variable to store a pointer to a dynamically allocated object.
EXPLANATION: The variable `key_type_dead` is a static variable, which means it will persist across function calls. However, the `name` field is assigned a dynamically allocated string. If this string is not properly deallocated, it will leak memory. This is a potential vulnerability because it can lead to memory exhaustion and other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this, the dynamically allocated string should be properly deallocated. This can be done by using a smart pointer or by manually calling `free()` on the string when it is no longer needed. For example: `struct key_type key_type_dead = {.name = strdup(".dead") };` and `free(key_type_dead.name);` when the object is no longer needed. Alternatively, consider using a `std::string` or other container that manages memory automatically.  ```c
struct key_type key_type_dead = {
	.name = strdup(".dead"),
};
``` 
```c
free(key_type_dead.name);
``` 
```c
struct key_type key
