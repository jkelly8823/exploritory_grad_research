VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the `info` pointer without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `info` pointer is being incremented without checking if it has reached the end of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `addrlen` is larger than the remaining space in the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the `info` pointer does not exceed the end of the buffer. This can be done by checking if `info + addrlen` is within the bounds of the buffer before incrementing the pointer. For example: `if (info + addrlen <= buffer_end) { info += addrlen; }`. Additionally, consider using a safer function like `memcpy_s` to prevent buffer overflows.  Please note that the buffer_end variable is assumed to be the end of the buffer. It should be replaced with the actual end of the buffer.  Also, the code snippet is missing the declaration of the variables and the buffer.  This is just an example of how to add bounds checking.  The actual fix may vary based on the actual code and
