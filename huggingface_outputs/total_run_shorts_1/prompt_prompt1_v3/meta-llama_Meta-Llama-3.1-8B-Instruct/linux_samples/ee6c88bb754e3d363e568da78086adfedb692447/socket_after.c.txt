VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of memcpy to copy a struct into a buffer without checking the size of the struct.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy the contents of the prim->ipaddr field into the info->sctpi_p_address field. However, the size of the prim->ipaddr field is not checked before the copy operation. If the size of the prim->ipaddr field is larger than the size of the info->sctpi_p_address field, a buffer overflow could occur, potentially leading to undefined behavior or even a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the prim->ipaddr field should be checked before the memcpy operation. This can be done by using the sizeof operator to get the size of the prim->ipaddr field and comparing it to the size of the info->sctpi_p_address field. If the sizes are not equal, an error should be returned or an appropriate action taken to prevent the buffer overflow. Alternatively, the memcpy function can be replaced with a safer function such as strncpy or strcpy, which can handle the size of the destination
