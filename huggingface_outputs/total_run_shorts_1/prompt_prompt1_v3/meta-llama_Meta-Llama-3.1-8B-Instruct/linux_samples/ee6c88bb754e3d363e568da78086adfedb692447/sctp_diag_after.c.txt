VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code. The memcpy function is used to copy data into the info buffer without checking the size of the data being copied. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data being copied is larger than the remaining space in the info buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances of memcpy that copy data into the info buffer without checking the size of the data being copied. The memset function is used to zero out the remaining space in the info buffer, but this does not prevent a buffer overflow if the data being copied is larger than the remaining space. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the size of the data being copied before calling memcpy. This can be done by using the strlcpy function instead of memcpy, which checks the size of the destination buffer and prevents buffer overflows. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a dynamically allocated buffer that is large enough to hold the data being copied. Additionally, the code should be reviewed
