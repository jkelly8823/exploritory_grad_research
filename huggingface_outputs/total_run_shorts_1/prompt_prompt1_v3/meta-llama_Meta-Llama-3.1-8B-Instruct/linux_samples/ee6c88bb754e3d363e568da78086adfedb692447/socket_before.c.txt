VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of memcpy() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy() function is used to copy data from the prim->ipaddr field into the info->sctpi_p_address field. However, the size of the prim->ipaddr field is not checked before the copy operation, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the field is larger than the info->sctpi_p_address field.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the prim->ipaddr field should be checked before the memcpy() operation. This can be done by using the strlen() function to get the length of the prim->ipaddr field and then using that length as the size argument to memcpy(). Alternatively, the sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage) size can be replaced with the actual size of the prim->ipaddr field to prevent potential buffer overflows.
