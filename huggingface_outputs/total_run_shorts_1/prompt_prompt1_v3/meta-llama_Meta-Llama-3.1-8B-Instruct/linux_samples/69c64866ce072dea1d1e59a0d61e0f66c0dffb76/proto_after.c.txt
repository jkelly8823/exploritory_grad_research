 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The `dccp_clear_xmit_timers` function is called before the `ccid_hc_rx_delete` and `ccid_hc_tx_delete` functions. This could lead to a situation where the `dccp_clear_xmit_timers` function attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
EXPLANATION: The `dccp_clear_xmit_timers` function is called before the `ccid_hc_rx_delete` and `ccid_hc_tx_delete` functions. This is problematic because the `dccp_clear_xmit_timers` function likely relies on the `dccps_hc_rx_ccid` and `dccps_hc_tx_ccid` pointers being valid. However, the `ccid_hc_rx_delete` and `ccid_hc_tx_delete` functions will free the memory pointed to by these pointers. If the `dccp_clear_xmit_timers` function is called before the `ccid_hc_rx_delete` and `ccid_hc_tx_delete` functions, it may attempt to access memory that has already been freed, leading to
