VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of a variable-length macro expansion in a context where the expansion is not properly bounded.
EXPLANATION: The SEC_FTR_DEFAULT macro is expanded to include the SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_HV and SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_LV macros. However, the expansion of these macros is not properly bounded, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the expansion exceeds the maximum allowed size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the expansion of the SEC_FTR_DEFAULT macro should be properly bounded to prevent buffer overflows. This can be achieved by using a fixed-size array or a bounded expansion mechanism. Additionally, the SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_HV and SEC_FTR_L1D_FLUSH_LV macros should be reviewed to ensure that their expansion is properly bounded.  The SEC_FTR_DEFAULT macro should be reviewed to ensure that it does not include any other variable-length macro expansions that could lead to buffer overflows.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not include any other potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  The code should be reviewed to ensure
