 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a non-const pointer to a variable in a conditional compilation block. The variable 'one' is assigned to the 'extra1' and 'extra2' fields, but it is not declared as const, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the value of 'one' changes.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the 'one' variable is not declared as const, which means it can be modified after its initial assignment. In the conditional compilation block, the 'extra1' and 'extra2' fields are assigned the address of 'one', which could lead to unexpected behavior if the value of 'one' changes. This is a potential vulnerability because it could allow an attacker to modify the behavior of the code by changing the value of 'one'.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'one' variable should be declared as const to prevent it from being modified after its initial assignment. The 'extra1' and 'extra2' fields should also be assigned the address of a const variable to ensure that their values are not modified unexpectedly. For example: const
