VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in this code. The variable'report' is being used after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The variable'report' is freed when the function returns due to the'return -ENODEV' statement. However, the code continues to use'report' after this point, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The'return -ENODEV' statement should be moved above the line where'report' is freed. This will ensure that'report' is not used after it has been freed. Alternatively, the code can be modified to check if'report' is NULL before using it. This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability is present in this code. The variable 'zpff' is being dereferenced without checking if it is NULL.
EXPLANANATION: The variable 'zpff' is allocated using kzalloc, but it is not checked if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, 'zp
