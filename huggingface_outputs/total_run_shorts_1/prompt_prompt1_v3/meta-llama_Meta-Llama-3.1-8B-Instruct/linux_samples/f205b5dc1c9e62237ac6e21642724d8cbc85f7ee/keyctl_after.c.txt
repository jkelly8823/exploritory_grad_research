VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the input string `_name` in the `keyctl_join_session_keyring` function.
EXPLANATION: The `keyctl_join_session_keyring` function takes a user-supplied string `_name` as input and uses it to join a session keyring. However, there is no bounds checking on the length of the input string, which makes it vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input string that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking on the length of the input string `_name` to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size. This can be done by using a function like `strncpy` with a maximum length, or by using a safer function like `snprintf` to copy the string into a buffer. Additionally, the code should consider using a more secure function like `kstrdup` to allocate memory for the input string, which can help prevent buffer overflows.
