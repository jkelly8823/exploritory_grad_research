VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. The function install_thread_keyring_to_cred() and install_process_keyring_to_cred() do not check if the new cred pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a segmentation fault if a null pointer is passed to these functions.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is a part of a Linux kernel module that deals with keyring management. The functions install_thread_keyring_to_cred() and install_process_keyring_to_cred() are used to install thread and process keyrings to the given credentials struct. However, these functions do not check if the new cred pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a segmentation fault if a null pointer is passed to these functions. The functions install_thread_keyring() and install_process_keyring() also do not check if the new cred pointer is null before passing it to the above-mentioned functions.
