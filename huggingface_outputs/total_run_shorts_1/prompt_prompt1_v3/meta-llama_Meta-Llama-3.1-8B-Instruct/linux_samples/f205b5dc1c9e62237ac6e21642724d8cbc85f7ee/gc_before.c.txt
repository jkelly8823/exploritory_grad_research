VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A memory leak is present due to the struct key_type_dead being allocated but not freed.
EXPLANATION: The struct key_type_dead is allocated on the stack, but it is not freed. This means that the memory allocated for the struct will not be released back to the system, resulting in a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this memory leak, the struct key_type_dead should be dynamically allocated using malloc() and then freed using free() when it is no longer needed. Alternatively, the struct key_type_dead could be declared as a static variable, which would also prevent the memory leak.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function name is not descriptive and does not follow the standard naming conventions.
EXPLANATION: The function name "immediately unlinked" does not provide any information about what the function does. It is also not in the standard camelCase or underscore notation, which makes it harder to understand and maintain.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this, the function name should be changed to something more descriptive, such as "schedule_garbage
