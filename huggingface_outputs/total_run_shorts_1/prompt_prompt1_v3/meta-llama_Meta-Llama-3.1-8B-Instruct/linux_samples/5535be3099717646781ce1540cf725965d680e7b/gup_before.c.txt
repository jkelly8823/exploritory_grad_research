VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition in the follow_page_pte function. Specifically, the check for FOLL_WRITE and can_follow_write_pte is not atomic with the pte_unmap_unlock and return NULL operations. This can lead to a situation where a page is unmapped and then reused before the check is completed, resulting in a stale page being returned.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the check for FOLL_WRITE and can_follow_write_pte is performed after the pte_unmap_unlock operation. This means that if the check fails, the page will be unmapped and then reused before the check is completed, resulting in a stale page being returned. This can lead to a race condition where a page is accessed before it is properly initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the check for FOLL_WRITE and can_follow_write_pte should be performed before the pte_unmap_unlock operation. This can be achieved by moving the check above the pte_unmap_unlock operation. Additionally, the return NULL operation should be atomic with the check to prevent a stale page from being returned. This can be achieved
