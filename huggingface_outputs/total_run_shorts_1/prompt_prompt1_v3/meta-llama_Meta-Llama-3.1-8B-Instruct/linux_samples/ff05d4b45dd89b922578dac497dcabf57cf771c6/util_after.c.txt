VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The `scratch_len` variable is set to `params->len`, but it is not checked if the `scratch` buffer is large enough to hold the contents of `params->start` and `params->len`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `params->len` is larger than the size of the `scratch` buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `scratch_len` variable is used to allocate memory for the `scratch` buffer using `kzalloc`. However, the size of the `scratch` buffer is not checked before it is used to store data. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the `scratch` buffer is smaller than the size of the data being stored.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the `scratch` buffer is large enough to hold the contents of `params->start` and `params->len` before storing data in it. This can be done by checking if `scratch_len` is greater than or equal to `params->len`. If it is not, an error should be returned. Additionally
