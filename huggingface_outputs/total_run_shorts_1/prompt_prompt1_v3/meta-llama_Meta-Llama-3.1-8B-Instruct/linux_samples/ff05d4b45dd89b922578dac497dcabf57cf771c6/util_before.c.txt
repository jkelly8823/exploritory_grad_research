VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The `nontransmitted_profile` pointer is freed before it is used in the `cfg80211_find_ext_elem` function.
EXPLANATION: The `nontransmitted_profile` pointer is freed in the `kfree(nontransmitted_profile)` line, but it is still used in the `cfg80211_find_ext_elem` function. This is a use-after-free vulnerability because the memory pointed to by `nontransmitted_profile` has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `cfg80211_find_ext_elem` function should be called before the `nontransmitted_profile` pointer is freed. Alternatively, a copy of the `nontransmitted_profile` data should be made before freeing the original pointer. This will ensure that the memory pointed to by `nontransmitted_profile` is not freed until it is no longer needed. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the line where `cfg80211_find_ext_elem` is called. This is because the `nontransmitted_profile` pointer is used in this function, but it has already been freed. The `offsetofend` macro
