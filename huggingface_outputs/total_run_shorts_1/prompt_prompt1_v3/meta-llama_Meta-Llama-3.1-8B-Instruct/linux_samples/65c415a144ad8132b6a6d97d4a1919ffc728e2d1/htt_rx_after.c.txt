VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The `msdu` pointer is freed in the `dev_kfree_skb_any` function, but it is still used in the `ath10k_htt_rx_h_csum_offload` function.
EXPLANATION: The `dev_kfree_skb_any` function is called when the fragment with invalid PN or multicast DA is discarded. However, the `ath10k_htt_rx_h_csum_offload` function is still called on the same `msdu` pointer, which has already been freed. This can lead to a use-after-free bug, causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the `ath10k_htt_rx_h_csum_offload` function should be called before the `dev_kfree_skb_any` function. Alternatively, the `msdu` pointer should be checked for NULL before using it in the `ath10k_htt_rx_h_csum_offload` function. Additionally, the `frag_pn_check` and `multicast_check` variables should be reset to their default values after the
