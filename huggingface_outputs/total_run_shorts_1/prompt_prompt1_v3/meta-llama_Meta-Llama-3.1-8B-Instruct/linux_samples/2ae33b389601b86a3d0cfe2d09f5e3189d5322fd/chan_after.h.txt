VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the rows_out parameter.
EXPLANATION: The rows_out parameter is declared as an unsigned short, which is typically 16 bits. However, the function chan_window_size is not checking if the rows_out parameter is within the valid range. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value passed to rows_out is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an unsigned short.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the rows_out parameter is within the valid range. This can be done by checking if the value passed to rows_out is less than or equal to the maximum value that can be stored in an unsigned short. If the value is larger, return an error or handle it accordingly. For example: if (*rows_out > USHRT_MAX) { return -1; }  where USHRT_MAX is the maximum value that can be stored in an unsigned short.  Also, consider using a safer data type such as size_t which is designed to hold the size of any object, including large arrays.  This will prevent buffer overflows and make
