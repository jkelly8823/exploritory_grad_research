VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The memset function is used to clear the contents of the param array, but the size of the array is not checked. If the size of the array is larger than the size of the buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The memset function is used to clear the contents of the param array. However, the size of the array is not checked before clearing it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the array is larger than the size of the buffer. The cypress_send_ext_cmd function is called with the param array as an argument, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the array is not properly cleared.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The size of the param array should be checked before clearing it with memset. The size of the array should be compared to the size of the buffer to prevent a buffer overflow. The memset function should be called with the correct size of the array to prevent a buffer overflow. The code should be modified to check the size of the array before clearing it with memset. The code should be modified to prevent a buffer overflow by checking the size
