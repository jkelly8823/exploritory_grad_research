VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. The function gpmc_setup_irq() returns an error value, but the code does not check for this error before proceeding to use the gpmc_dev pointer.
EXPLANATION: The function gpmc_setup_irq() returns an error value if it fails, but the code does not check for this error before proceeding to use the gpmc_dev pointer. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if gpmc_setup_irq() returns an error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of gpmc_setup_irq() before proceeding to use the gpmc_dev pointer. This can be done by adding a check for IS_ERR_VALUE(gpmc_setup_irq()) and handling the error accordingly. For example: if (IS_ERR_VALUE(gpmc_setup_irq())) { dev_err(gpmc_dev, "gpmc_setup_irq failed\n"); return -EINVAL; } else { /* proceed with using gpmc_dev pointer */ } ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
