 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. If the function radeon_legacy_get_primary_dac_info_from_table() returns null, the pointer p_dac will be null, and the function will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the variable found is not equal to 1, and if so, it calls the function radeon_legacy_get_primary_dac_info_from_table(). However, it does not check if the return value of this function is null before assigning it to the pointer p_dac. This is a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the return value of radeon_legacy_get_primary_dac_info_from_table() is null before assigning it to p_dac. This can be done by adding a null check before the return statement. For example: if (radeon_legacy_get_primary_dac_info_from_table(rdev, p_dac)!= NULL) { return p_dac; } else { /* handle the error */ }. This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure that
