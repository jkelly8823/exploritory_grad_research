VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The mutex lock is acquired after the check for the existence of the RNG with the same name, but the check itself is not atomic. This means that another thread could potentially register an RNG with the same name between the check and the lock, resulting in a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the mutex lock is not acquired before the check for the existence of the RNG with the same name. This allows another thread to potentially register an RNG with the same name between the check and the lock, resulting in a race condition. To fix this issue, the mutex lock should be acquired before the check for the existence of the RNG with the same name.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the mutex lock should be acquired before the check for the existence of the RNG with the same name. This can be achieved by moving the mutex_lock(&rng_mutex); line above the check for the existence of the RNG with the same name. The corrected code should look like this: mutex_lock(&rng_mutex); err = -EEXIST; list_for_each_entry(tmp, &rng_list, list
