VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The ext_pullup_enable_pin field is set to -EINVAL, which is an invalid value. This can cause issues when the platform device is initialized.
EXPLANATION: The ext_pullup_enable_pin field is used to specify the pin that enables the external pull-up resistor. However, setting it to -EINVAL indicates that the platform device does not support external pull-up resistors. This can cause issues when the platform device is initialized, as the driver may attempt to use the external pull-up resistor without checking if it is supported.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The ext_pullup_enable_pin field should be set to a valid pin number or -ENODEV if the platform device does not support external pull-up resistors. For example: ext_pullup_enable_pin = -ENODEV; or ext_pullup_enable_pin = 15; (assuming pin 15 is a valid pin number).  The correct value will depend on the specific hardware and requirements of the platform device.  It is also recommended to add a check in the driver to ensure that the external pull-up resistor is not used if it is not supported.  This can be done by checking the value of
