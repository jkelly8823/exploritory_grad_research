VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The `limits.min_perf_pct` variable is being used after the `all_cpu_data` array has been freed in the `intel_pstate_exit` function.
EXPLANATION: In the `intel_pstate_exit` function, the `all_cpu_data` array is freed using `vfree(all_cpu_data)`. However, the `limits.min_perf_pct` variable is still being used in the `intel_pstate_init` function, which is called after the `intel_pstate_exit` function. This is a classic example of a use-after-free bug, where the code is trying to access memory that has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the `limits.min_perf_pct` variable should be recalculated in the `intel_pstate_init` function after the `all_cpu_data` array has been reinitialized. Alternatively, the `limits.min_perf_pct` variable can be moved to a separate data structure that is not affected by the `all_cpu_data` array. Additionally, the `intel_pstate_init` function should be modified to check if the `all_cpu
