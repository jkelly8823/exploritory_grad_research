VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly check the return value of gpmc_setup_irq() before proceeding. This can lead to a situation where the function fails but the code continues to execute, potentially causing undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The gpmc_setup_irq() function is called and its return value is not checked. If the function fails, it will return an error value, but the code does not account for this. This can lead to a situation where the function fails but the code continues to execute, potentially causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of gpmc_setup_irq() before proceeding. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the return value is an error value. For example: if (IS_ERR_VALUE(gpmc_setup_irq())) {... } else {... } This will ensure that the code properly handles the return value of gpmc_setup_irq() and prevents undefined behavior.  Additionally, the code should also check the return value of gpmc_probe_dt(pdev) to prevent undefined behavior. The code should be modified to check the return value of gpmc
