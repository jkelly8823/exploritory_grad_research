VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a device driver for a Tegra AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) controller. The first line exports a symbol, and the second block of code defines a suspend function for the device. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. However, it is worth noting that the suspend function does not appear to check for errors when calling dev_get_drvdata, which could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference if the device data is not properly set.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this potential issue, the suspend function should be modified to check for errors when calling dev_get_drvdata. This can be done by checking the return value of dev_get_drvdata and handling any potential errors. For example:
```c
static int tegra_ahb_suspend(struct device *dev)
{
	int i;
	struct tegra_ahb *ahb;

	ahb = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
	if (IS_ERR(ahb)) {
		dev_err(dev, "Failed to get device
