VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (__pad4) to store high bits of st_blocks. This can lead to a security issue if the high bits are not properly handled.
EXPLANATION: The code checks for the byte order of the system and conditionally defines the order of __pad4 and st_blocks. However, the use of a fixed-size buffer to store high bits of st_blocks can lead to a buffer overflow if the high bits are not properly handled. This can result in a security issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically-sized buffer or a more robust data structure to store the high bits of st_blocks. Additionally, ensure that the high bits are properly handled and validated to prevent any potential security issues.  Consider using a safer alternative to storing high bits in a separate buffer, such as using a bit field or a separate data structure.
