VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the krealloc function call.
EXPLANATION:
The krealloc function call is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow because it does not check if the new size is larger than the current size of the memory block. If the new size is larger, krealloc will allocate a new block of memory and copy the contents of the old block to the new block. However, if the new size is smaller, krealloc will simply shrink the old block to the new size. In this case, the krealloc function call is allocating a new block of memory that is larger than the current size of the memory block, but it does not check if the new size is larger than the current size of the memory block. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the new size is larger than the current size of the memory block.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the krealloc function call should be modified to check if the new size is larger than the current size of the memory block before allocating a new block of memory. This can be done by adding a check to see if the new size is larger than the current size of the memory
