VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the imx6q_pm_init function. The suspend_set_ops function is called with a null pointer, which can lead to a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The suspend_set_ops function is called with a null pointer, which is not checked for null before being dereferenced. This can lead to a segmentation fault when the function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The suspend_set_ops function should be called with a valid pointer. The imx6q_pm_init function should be checked to ensure that the imx6q_pm_ops pointer is not null before calling suspend_set_ops. If the pointer is null, an error should be returned or handled accordingly.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the imx6q_suspend_finish function. The cpu_do_idle function is called without checking if the cpu_do_idle function pointer is null.
EXPLANATION: The cpu_do_idle function is called without checking if the cpu_do_idle function pointer is null. This can lead to a segmentation fault when the
