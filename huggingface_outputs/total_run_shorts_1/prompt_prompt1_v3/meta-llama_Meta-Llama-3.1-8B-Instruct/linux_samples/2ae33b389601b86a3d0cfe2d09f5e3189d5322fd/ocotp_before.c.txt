VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file that defines some constants for a specific hardware platform. It includes necessary header files and defines some macros. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a clean and well-structured header file. However, it would be a good practice to add comments to explain the purpose of each macro and constant defined in this file. This would make the code more readable and maintainable.  Please note that this code snippet is a header file and does not contain any executable code. Therefore, it is not possible to identify any security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.  However, it is always a good practice to review the included header files and the macros defined in this file to ensure that they do not contain any security vulnerabilities.  In this case, the included header files appear to be standard Linux kernel header files and do not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.  The macros defined in this file appear to be harmless and do not contain any security vulnerabilities.  Therefore
