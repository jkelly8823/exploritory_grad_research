VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the'soc_variant' variable.
EXPLANATION: The'soc_variant' variable is assigned a value from the'soc_variant' function call without any validation. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the function call returns an unexpected value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the'soc_variant' variable to prevent buffer overflows. This can be achieved by checking the return value of the'soc_variant' function call against a valid range of values. For example: if (soc_variant >= 0 && soc_variant <= 255) {... } else {... }.
