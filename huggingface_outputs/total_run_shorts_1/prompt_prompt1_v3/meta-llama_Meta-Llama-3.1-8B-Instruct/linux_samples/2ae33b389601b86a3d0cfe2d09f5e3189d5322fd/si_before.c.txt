 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a function that resets a GPU. It checks a condition involving a variable `tmp` and a constant `L2_BUSY`, and if true, it sets a bit in the `reset_mask`. The function then returns the `reset_mask`. The code seems to be well-structured and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for potential issues, especially when working with sensitive hardware like GPUs. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the variables involved.  ```
