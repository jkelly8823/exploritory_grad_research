VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The variable target_state is assigned a value of PM_SUSPEND_ON without any bounds checking. If the value of PM_SUSPEND_ON is larger than the size of the buffer that target_state points to, a buffer overflow will occur.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is a function that handles power management for an AT91 device. The function at91_pm_enter is responsible for suspending the device's GPIO and IRQs, and then resuming them. However, the line target_state = PM_SUSPEND_ON; is problematic. The variable target_state is assigned a value of PM_SUSPEND_ON without any bounds checking. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of PM_SUSPEND_ON is larger than the size of the buffer that target_state points to.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include bounds checking when assigning a value to target_state. This could be done by checking the size of the buffer that target_state points to before assigning a value to it. Additionally, the value of PM_SUSPEND_ON should be validated to ensure it is within the
