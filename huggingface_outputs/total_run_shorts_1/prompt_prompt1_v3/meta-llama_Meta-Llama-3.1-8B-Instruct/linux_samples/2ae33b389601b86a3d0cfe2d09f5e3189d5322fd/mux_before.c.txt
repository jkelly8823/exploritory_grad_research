VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential null pointer dereference
EXPLANATION: The function omap_mux_get_by_name() does not check if the muxname is null before passing it to the pr_err() function. If a null pointer is passed, it will cause a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check for the muxname parameter before passing it to the pr_err() function. For example: if (muxname == NULL) return -EINVAL; before the pr_err() function call.  Also, consider using a safer function like pr_err_ratelimited() to prevent excessive error messages.  Additionally, consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as returning an error code and logging the error separately.  Finally, consider using a more secure way to handle the muxname parameter, such as using a string copy function to ensure that the string is not modified after it is passed to the function.  The function omap_mux_init_signal() also does not check if the partition is null before accessing it.  This could also cause a null pointer dereference.  Consider adding a null check for the partition parameter before accessing it.  For example: if (
