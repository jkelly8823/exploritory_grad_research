VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `strcpy` function without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: 
The `strcpy` function is used to copy a string from one location to another. However, it does not perform any bounds checking, which means that if the source string is longer than the destination buffer, it can cause a buffer overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, consider using the
