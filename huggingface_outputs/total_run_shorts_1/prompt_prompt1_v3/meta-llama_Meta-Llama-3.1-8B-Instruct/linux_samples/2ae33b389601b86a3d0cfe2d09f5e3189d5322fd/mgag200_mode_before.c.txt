VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function mga_vga_mode_valid() does not properly validate the mode->crtc_hdisplay, mode->crtc_hsync_start, mode->crtc_hsync_end, and mode->crtc_htotal fields. It only checks if they are greater than 2048 or 4096, but it does not check if they are less than or equal to 0, which could lead to a buffer overflow or other issues.
EXPLANATION: The function mga_vga_mode_valid() is supposed to validate the mode->crtc_hdisplay, mode->crtc_hsync_start, mode->crtc_hsync_end, and mode->crtc_htotal fields. However, it only checks if they are greater than 2048 or 4096, but it does not check if they are less than or equal to 0. This could lead to a buffer overflow or other issues. For example, if mode->crtc_hdisplay is -1, it could cause the function to return MODE_BAD, but it would not catch the case where mode->crtc_hdisplay is 0, which is also an invalid value.
