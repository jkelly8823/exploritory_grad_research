VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition due to the lack of synchronization between the enable_clk_enet_out() and update_fec_mac_prop() functions.
EXPLANATION: The enable_clk_enet_out() and update_fec_mac_prop() functions are called in the same scope without any synchronization mechanism. This can lead to a race condition where the clk_enet_out is enabled before the fec_mac_prop is updated, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a synchronization mechanism such as a mutex or a semaphore to ensure that the enable_clk_enet_out() and update_fec_mac_prop() functions are executed in a thread-safe manner. Alternatively, consider reordering the function calls to ensure that update_fec_mac_prop() is called before enable_clk_enet_out(). Additionally, consider using a lock to protect the shared resources accessed by these functions. 

Note: The code snippet is likely from a Linux kernel driver, and the functions are likely called in a specific order to ensure proper initialization of the hardware. However, without more context, it is difficult to provide a more specific recommendation.
