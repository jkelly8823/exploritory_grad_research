VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition when initializing the VIC (Vector Interrupt Controller) and setting up the interrupt handlers. This is because the VIC initialization and the interrupt handler setup are not atomic operations, and the code does not ensure that the VIC is fully initialized before setting up the interrupt handlers.
EXPLANATION: The `vic_init` function is called before the loop that sets up the interrupt handlers. However, the `vic_init` function may take some time to complete, and during this time, the interrupt handlers may be set up. If the VIC is not fully initialized when the interrupt handlers are set up, it may lead to a race condition, where the interrupt handlers are set up with an uninitialized VIC.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the VIC is fully initialized before setting up the interrupt handlers. This can be done by using a synchronization mechanism, such as a semaphore or a mutex, to ensure that the VIC initialization and the interrupt handler setup are atomic operations. Alternatively, the code can use a busy-wait loop to wait for the VIC initialization to complete before setting up the interrupt handlers. The recommended
