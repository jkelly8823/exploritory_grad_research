 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a conditional compilation block that checks for the presence of the CONFIG_PINCTRL_AT91 configuration option. If the option is present, it includes the definitions for at91_pinctrl_gpio_suspend and at91_pinctrl_gpio_resume. If the option is not present, it defines two inline functions that do nothing. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger project, and the context of the code should be taken into account when reviewing it.  The code snippet appears to be a part of a device tree binding for the at91 platform, and the conditional compilation block is used to handle the presence or absence of the pinctrl driver.  The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, but
