VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of strlcpy with a potentially unbounded source buffer.
EXPLANATION: The strlcpy function is used to copy a string from the source buffer to the destination buffer. However, the source buffer is a pointer to a character in the pi_buff array, and the size of the destination buffer is not checked against the size of the source buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is larger than the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer string copying function like strscpy, or manually check the size of the source buffer before copying it to the destination buffer. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure like a dynamically allocated string to avoid buffer overflows.
