VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of strncpy with a variable length string.
EXPLANATION: The strncpy function is used to copy a string from one location to another. However, the length of the string is determined by strlen, which does not account for the null-terminator. This means that the strncpy function may copy more characters than intended, potentially overflowing the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the safer strlcpy function instead of strncpy, which takes into account the size of the destination buffer and prevents buffer overflows. Alternatively, manually calculate the length of the string and pass it to strncpy to prevent the overflow. Additionally, consider using a safer function like strscpy to copy the string.
