VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The init_new_context function is called with a task_struct pointer (tsk) that may have already been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The init_new_context function is called with a task_struct pointer (tsk) that may have already been freed. This is because the check_and_switch_context function is called with a task_struct pointer (tsk) that may have already been freed. The check_and_switch_context function is called with a task_struct pointer (tsk) that may have already been freed. This is because the task_struct pointer (tsk) is not checked for validity before being passed to the check_and_switch_context function. The check_and_switch_context function is called with a task_struct pointer (tsk) that may have already been freed.
