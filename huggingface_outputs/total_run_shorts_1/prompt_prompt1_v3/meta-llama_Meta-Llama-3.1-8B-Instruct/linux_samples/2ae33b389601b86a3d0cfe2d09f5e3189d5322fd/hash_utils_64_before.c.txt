VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition in the early_init_mmu_secondary function. The function is not thread-safe, and the use of local_irq_save(flags) does not guarantee that the hash_page function will not be interrupted by an interrupt handler.
EXPLANATION: The early_init_mmu_secondary function is called from the __cpuinit section, which is executed before the CPU is fully initialized. This function is responsible for initializing the MMU on secondary CPUs. However, the function is not thread-safe, and the use of local_irq_save(flags) does not guarantee that the hash_page function will not be interrupted by an interrupt handler. This can lead to a race condition, where the hash_page function is interrupted while it is in the middle of updating the hash table, resulting in inconsistent state.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the early_init_mmu_secondary function should be made thread-safe by using a lock to protect the critical section. The lock should be acquired before calling the hash_page function and released after the function returns. Additionally, the use of local_irq_save(flags) should be replaced with a more robust interrupt handling mechanism, such as
