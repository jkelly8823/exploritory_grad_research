VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Padding bytes are used to ensure proper alignment of the struct.
EXPLANATION: 
Padding bytes are used to ensure proper alignment of the struct. The size of the struct is 1024 bits, but the size of sigset_t is less than 1024 bits. The padding bytes are used to ensure that the struct is properly aligned in memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
This code is safe as is. However, if the size of sigset_t changes in the future, the padding bytes may need to be adjusted. It is recommended to use a more dynamic approach to ensure proper alignment, such as using a union or a struct with a variable size member.
