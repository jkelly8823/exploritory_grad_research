 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a series of function calls to TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE, which is likely a macro or function used to duplicate clock settings. Each call is well-formed and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The code is also well-structured and follows a consistent pattern.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as the code appears to be secure. However, it is always a good practice to review the implementation of TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE to ensure it is correctly handling the clock settings and not introducing any vulnerabilities. Additionally, it may be beneficial to consider adding error handling or validation to ensure that the inputs to TEGRA_CLK_DUPLICATE are valid.
