VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of a fixed stack randomization mask (STACK_RND_MASK = 0).
EXPLANATION: The use of a fixed stack randomization mask (STACK_RND_MASK = 0) can make it easier for attackers to predict the location of the stack, potentially leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. This is because a fixed mask can be used to calculate the stack base address, allowing an attacker to craft a buffer overflow attack that targets a specific location on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more secure stack randomization technique, such as the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) mechanism. This can be achieved by setting the STACK_RND_MASK to a non-zero value, such as a random number generated at runtime. Additionally, consider implementing other security measures, such as stack canaries or non-executable stacks, to further protect against buffer overflow attacks.  The use of a fixed stack randomization mask (STACK_RND_MASK = 0) can make it easier for attackers to predict the location of the stack, potentially leading to
