VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the mutex_unlock and list_add_tail operations. The mutex_unlock operation is not protected by a lock, allowing another thread to access the dpm_list while the current thread is still modifying it.
EXPLANATION: The mutex_unlock operation is not protected by a lock, allowing another thread to access the dpm_list while the current thread is still modifying it. This can lead to a race condition where the list is modified concurrently by multiple threads.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the mutex_unlock operation should be protected by a lock. This can be achieved by adding a lock around the list_add_tail operation, or by using a lock that covers the entire critical section. For example: mutex_lock(&dpm_list_mtx); list_add_tail(&dev->power.entry, &dpm_list); mutex_unlock(&dpm_list_mtx);. Alternatively, the mutex_unlock operation can be removed and the list_add_tail operation can be performed while still holding the lock. For example: mutex_lock(&dpm_list_mtx); list_add_tail(&dev->power.entry, &dpm_list); mutex_lock(&dpm_list
