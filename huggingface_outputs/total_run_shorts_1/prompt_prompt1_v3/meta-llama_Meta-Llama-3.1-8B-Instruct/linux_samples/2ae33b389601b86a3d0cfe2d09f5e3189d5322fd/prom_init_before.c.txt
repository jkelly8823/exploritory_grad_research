VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the __reloc_toc function. The function does not properly check the bounds of the toc_entry pointer, allowing an attacker to potentially write beyond the end of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the toc_entry pointer is incremented without checking if it has reached the end of the buffer. This allows an attacker to write beyond the end of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. The code also uses a magic number (sizeof(long)) which is not defined in the given snippet, making it harder to analyze.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the bounds of the toc_entry pointer before incrementing it. Additionally, the magic number (sizeof(long)) should be replaced with a defined constant. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all memory accesses are properly bounded. The __reloc_toc function should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not have any other vulnerabilities.  The function should also be reviewed to ensure that
