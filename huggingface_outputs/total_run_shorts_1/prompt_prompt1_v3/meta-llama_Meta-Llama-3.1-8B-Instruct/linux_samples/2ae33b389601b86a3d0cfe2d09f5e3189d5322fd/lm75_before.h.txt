VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a simple header file for a Linux kernel driver. It includes the necessary header file for hwmon and defines two constants for the minimum and maximum temperatures that the LM75 temperature sensor can measure. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a straightforward and secure implementation.  The code is well-structured and follows standard practices for Linux kernel driver development.  The use of constants for the temperature limits is a good practice, as it makes the code more readable and maintainable.  Overall, this code snippet is secure and does not require any changes.  However, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of the constants and the reasoning behind the chosen temperature limits.  This would make the code more understandable for other developers who may need to maintain or modify it in the future.  Additionally, it would be a good idea to consider adding error handling code to handle any potential issues that may arise during the execution of the driver.  This would
