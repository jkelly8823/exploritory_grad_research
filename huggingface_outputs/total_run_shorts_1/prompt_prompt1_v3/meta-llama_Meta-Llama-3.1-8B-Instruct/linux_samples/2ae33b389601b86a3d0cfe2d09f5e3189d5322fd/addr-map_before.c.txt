VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of the cs++ variable in the calculation of the index for the mbus_dram_window struct.
EXPLANATION: The cs++ variable is incremented without checking if it has reached the end of the array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access if the loop iterates beyond the last element of the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that cs does not exceed the bounds of the array before incrementing it. This can be done by checking if cs is less than the size of the array. For example: if (cs < sizeof(orion_mbus_dram_info.cs) / sizeof(orion_mbus_dram_info.cs[0])) { cs++; } else { /* handle error */ }. Additionally, consider using a safer way to access the array, such as using a for loop instead of incrementing a pointer.  ```c
for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(orion_mbus_dram_info.cs) / sizeof(orion_mbus_dram_info.cs[0]); i++) {
    struct mbus_dram_window
