VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The memset function is used to clear the contents of the param array, but the size of the array is not checked before the memset function is called. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the param array is not correctly calculated.
EXPLANATION: The memset function is used to clear the contents of the param array. However, the size of the array is not checked before the memset function is called. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the param array is not correctly calculated. The memset function is called with the size of the param array, which is sizeof(param). However, the size of the param array is not guaranteed to be correct, and could potentially be larger than the actual size of the array. This could lead to a buffer overflow, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the param array should be checked before the memset function is called. This can be done by using the sizeof operator to get the size of the param array, and then checking that the size is correct before
