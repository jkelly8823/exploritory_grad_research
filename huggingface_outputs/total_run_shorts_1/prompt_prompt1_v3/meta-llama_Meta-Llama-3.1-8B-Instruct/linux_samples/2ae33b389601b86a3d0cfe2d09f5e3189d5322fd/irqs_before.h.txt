 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 27, 28
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains two reserved interrupt numbers (27 and 28) which are not handled or defined, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes when these interrupts are triggered.
EXPLANATION: The code defines a set of interrupt numbers, but two of them are marked as reserved. This means that these interrupt numbers are not handled or defined in the code, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes when these interrupts are triggered. This is a vulnerability because it can cause the system to malfunction or crash, potentially leading to security issues or data loss.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the reserved interrupt numbers should be handled or defined in the code. This can be done by adding a check to handle these interrupts or by defining a default behavior for these interrupts. For example, the code could add a check to handle interrupt 27 and 28, or it could define a default behavior for these interrupts, such as ignoring them or triggering a warning. The exact fix will depend on the specific requirements of the system and the desired behavior.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to add comments to explain why these interrupt numbers are reserved and what the implications
