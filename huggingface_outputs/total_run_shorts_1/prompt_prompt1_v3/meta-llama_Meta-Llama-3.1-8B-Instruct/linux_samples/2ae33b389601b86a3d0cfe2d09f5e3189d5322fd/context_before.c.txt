VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The atomic64_xchg operation is not properly synchronized with the raw_spin_lock_irqsave operation. This can lead to a situation where the active_asids value is overwritten before the lock is acquired, resulting in a potential data corruption.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the atomic64_xchg operation is not protected by the raw_spin_lock_irqsave. This means that another CPU can potentially overwrite the active_asids value before the lock is acquired, leading to a data corruption. The new_context function is also not properly synchronized, which can lead to a situation where the ASID is not properly updated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the atomic64_xchg operation should be moved inside the raw_spin_lock_irqsave block. This will ensure that the active_asids value is properly synchronized with the lock. Additionally, the new_context function should be called inside the raw_spin_lock_irqsave block to ensure that the ASID is properly updated. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all other operations that access the active_asids value are properly synchronized.
