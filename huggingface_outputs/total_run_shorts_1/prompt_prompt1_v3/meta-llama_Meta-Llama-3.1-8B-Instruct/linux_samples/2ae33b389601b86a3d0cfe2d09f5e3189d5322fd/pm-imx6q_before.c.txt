VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The `phys_l2x0_saved_regs` variable is assigned the physical address of `l2x0_saved_regs` without checking if `l2x0_saved_regs` has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The `phys_l2x0_saved_regs` variable is assigned the physical address of `l2x0_saved_regs` using the `__pa` function. However, there is no guarantee that `l2x0_saved_regs` has not been freed before this assignment. If `l2x0_saved_regs` has been freed, then accessing its physical address will result in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if `l2x0_saved_regs` has been freed before assigning its physical address to `phys_l2x0_saved_regs`. This can be done by checking the return value of `__pa` or by using a more robust way to get the physical address of `l2x0_saved_regs`. Additionally, the code should ensure that `l2x0_saved_regs` is not freed until
