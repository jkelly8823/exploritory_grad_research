VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, 22-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the use of magic numbers. Magic numbers are numbers that appear directly in the code without explanation or context. In this case, the numbers 0xfffff308, 0xfffff30c, and 0xfffff310 are used as addresses without any explanation of what they represent or how they were derived. This can make the code difficult to understand and maintain, and can also lead to errors if the addresses are changed without updating the code.
EXPLANATION: The use of magic numbers can be a security vulnerability because it can make it difficult to understand the code and its behavior. If an attacker can manipulate the addresses used in the code, they may be able to exploit the system. Additionally, the use of magic numbers can make it difficult to debug the code, as the meaning of the numbers may not be immediately clear.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use symbolic addresses or constants instead of magic numbers. This can be done by defining a constant or a macro for each address,
