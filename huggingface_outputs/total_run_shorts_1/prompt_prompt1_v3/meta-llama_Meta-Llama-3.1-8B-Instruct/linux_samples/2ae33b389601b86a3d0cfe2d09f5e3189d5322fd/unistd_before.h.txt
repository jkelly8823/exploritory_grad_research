VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file defining constants for system call numbers. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a header file that defines constants for system call numbers. The constants are defined using the #define directive, which is a preprocessor directive that defines a macro. The macros are then used to define the system call numbers. The code snippet does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). The code is also well-structured and follows standard C programming practices.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a well-written and secure header file. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and follows best practices. Additionally, it is a good idea to use a code review tool to catch any potential issues before the code is committed to the repository.  ```bash
