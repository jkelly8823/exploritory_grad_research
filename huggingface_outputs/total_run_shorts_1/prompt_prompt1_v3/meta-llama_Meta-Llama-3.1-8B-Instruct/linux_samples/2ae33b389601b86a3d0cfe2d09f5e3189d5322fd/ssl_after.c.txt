VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition vulnerability exists due to the use of shared variables between ssl_init and ssl_exit, which are both serialized.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a shared variable that is referenced by both ssl_init and ssl_exit, which are serialized. This can lead to a race condition vulnerability. The shared variable is not properly synchronized, allowing for potential data corruption or other issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, synchronize access to the shared variable using a mutex or other synchronization mechanism. This will ensure that only one thread can access the variable at a time, preventing potential data corruption or other issues. Additionally, consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a lock or semaphore, to ensure that the shared variable is properly protected.  ```bash
// Example of how to synchronize access to the shared variable using a mutex
mutex = Mutex.new();
ssl_init() {
    mutex.lock();
    // Access shared variable here
    mutex.unlock();
}
ssl_exit() {
    mutex.lock();
    // Access shared variable here
    mutex.unlock();
}
``` ```bash
```bash
