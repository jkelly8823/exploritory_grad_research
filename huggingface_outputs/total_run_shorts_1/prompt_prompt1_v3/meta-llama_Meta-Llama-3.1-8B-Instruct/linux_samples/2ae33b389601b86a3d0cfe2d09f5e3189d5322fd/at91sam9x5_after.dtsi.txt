VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of hardcoded pin numbers. This can lead to issues if the pin configuration changes or if the code is ported to a different platform.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses hardcoded pin numbers to configure the NAND interface. This can be problematic because it tightly couples the code to a specific hardware configuration. If the pin configuration changes or if the code is ported to a different platform, the hardcoded pin numbers may no longer be valid, leading to issues with the NAND interface.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more flexible pin configuration mechanism, such as a pin mapping table or a configuration file. This would allow the pin numbers to be easily updated or modified without requiring changes to the code. Additionally, consider using a more robust pin configuration mechanism, such as a pin multiplexer or a pin expander, to
