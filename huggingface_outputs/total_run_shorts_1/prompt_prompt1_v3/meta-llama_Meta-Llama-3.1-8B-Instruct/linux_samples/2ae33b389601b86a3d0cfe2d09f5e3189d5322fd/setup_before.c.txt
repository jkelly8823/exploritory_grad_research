 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module, specifically dealing with CPU information. It defines two structs, `new_cpu_data` and `boot_cpu_data`, which contain information about the CPU. The `boot_cpu_data` struct is marked as `__read_mostly`, indicating that it should be read-only after initialization. The `EXPORT_SYMBOL` macro is used to export the `boot_cpu_data` symbol, making it accessible to other modules. The `def_to_bigsmp` variable is not used in this snippet and seems to be a leftover or a placeholder. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and follows standard Linux kernel coding practices.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities or issues that require attention. However, it would be beneficial to review the code in the context of the entire kernel module to ensure that it is correctly implemented and follows all relevant coding standards.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger kernel module, and its functionality and correctness depend on the surrounding code.
