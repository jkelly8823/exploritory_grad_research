 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the offset variable without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet increments the offset variable by 2 without checking if it exceeds the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the offset is already at the maximum allowed value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure the offset does not exceed the buffer size before incrementing it. For example, you can add a check like this: if (init->offset + 2 <= buffer_size) { init->offset += 2; } else { handle_error(); } where buffer_size is the maximum allowed size of the buffer.  ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
