VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function acpi_processor_get_performance_info() does not properly handle the case where the acpi_status status is not AE_OK. This can lead to a potential information leak or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The function acpi_processor_get_performance_info() returns the result variable directly without checking the status of the acpi_status status. This means that if the status is not AE_OK, the function will return an incorrect result, potentially leading to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function should be modified to check the status of the acpi_status status before returning the result. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if the status is AE_OK before returning the result. For example: if (status == AE_OK) { return result; } else { return -EINVAL; } This will ensure that the function returns a correct result even if the status is not AE_OK. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where the acpi_status status is not AE_OK, for example by returning an error code.
