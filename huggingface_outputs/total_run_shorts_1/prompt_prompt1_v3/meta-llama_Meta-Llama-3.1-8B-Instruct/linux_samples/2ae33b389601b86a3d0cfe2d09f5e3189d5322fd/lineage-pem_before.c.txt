VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a variable-length array in the pem_fan_attributes array.
EXPLANATION: The pem_fan_attributes array is declared as a variable-length array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of attributes exceeds the expected size. This can result in a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a fixed-size array or a dynamically allocated array with bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a linked list or a hash table to store the attributes.
