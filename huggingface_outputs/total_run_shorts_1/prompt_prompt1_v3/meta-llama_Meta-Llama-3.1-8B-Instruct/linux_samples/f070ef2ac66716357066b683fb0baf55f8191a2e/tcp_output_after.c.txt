VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the cloned skb is not successfully cloned, and the original skb is not freed. This can lead to a memory leak.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the cloned skb is successfully cloned, but it does not check if the original skb is freed. If the cloned skb is not successfully cloned, the original skb will not be freed, leading to a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if the cloned skb is successfully cloned, and if not, free the original skb. This can be done by adding a check for the return value of skb_unclone, and freeing the original skb if it is not successfully cloned. For example: if (skb_unclone(skb, gfp)) { kfree_skb(skb); return -ENOMEM; } .
