VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The function kvm_iommu_map_pages() is called with a pointer to a struct kvm_memory_slot, but the function does not check if the pointer is valid before using it. If the pointer is freed before the function is called, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function kvm_iommu_map_pages() takes a pointer to a struct kvm_memory_slot as an argument. However, it does not check if the pointer is valid before using it. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the pointer is freed before the function is called. The function kvm_iommu_put_pages() is called with a pointer to a struct iommu_domain, but it does not check if the pointer is valid before using it. This can also lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the pointer is freed before the function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the functions kvm_iommu_map_pages() and kvm_iommu_put_pages() should check if the pointers to struct kvm_memory_slot and struct iommu_domain are valid before using
