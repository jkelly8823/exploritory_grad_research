VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of copy_to_user() without checking the size of the user-space buffer.
EXPLANATION: The copy_to_user() function is used to copy data from kernel space to user space. However, it does not perform any checks on the size of the user-space buffer. If the user-space buffer is smaller than the size of the data being copied, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the user-space buffer should be checked before calling copy_to_user(). This can be done by using the get_user() function to retrieve the size of the buffer from user space and then checking if it is sufficient to hold the data being copied. If the buffer is too small, an error should be returned. Alternatively, the copy_to_user() function can be replaced with a safer alternative, such as copy_to_user_safe(), which performs size checks internally.  The code should be modified to include the necessary checks to prevent buffer overflows.  For example: size_t buffer_size; get_user(buffer_size, arg);
