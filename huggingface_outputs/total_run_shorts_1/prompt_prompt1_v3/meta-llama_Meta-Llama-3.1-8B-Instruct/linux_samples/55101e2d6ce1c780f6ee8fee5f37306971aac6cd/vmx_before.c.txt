VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information leak due to the manual disabling of SMEP when the guest switches to non-paging mode. This can allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The code is attempting to emulate the behavior of a CPU in non-paging mode by disabling SMEP. However, this can lead to a potential information leak if an attacker is able to manipulate the guest's state to access sensitive information. This is because SMEP is designed to prevent access to kernel memory from user space, and disabling it can allow an attacker to access this memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should not manually disable SMEP when the guest switches to non-paging mode. Instead, it should rely on the CPU's hardware to disable SMEP in non-paging mode. This can be achieved by checking the CPU's capabilities and only disabling SMEP if the CPU supports it. Additionally, the code should ensure that SMEP is re-enabled when the guest switches back to paging mode. This will prevent any potential information leaks and ensure the security of the system.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that
