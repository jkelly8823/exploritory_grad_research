 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is located in the line where the bytes variable is calculated. The bytes variable is calculated as min_t(const size_t, cur_len, PAGE_SIZE), which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the cur_len is larger than PAGE_SIZE.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the min_t function to calculate the bytes variable, which is the number of bytes to be copied from the user space to the kernel space. However, the min_t function can return a value that is larger than PAGE_SIZE, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This is because the min_t function takes the minimum of two values, and if the cur_len is larger than PAGE_SIZE, the min_t function will return the cur_len value, which can be larger than PAGE_SIZE.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function to calculate the bytes variable, such as the clamp function, which can prevent the buffer overflow. The clamp function can be used to clamp the cur_len value to a maximum value of PAGE_SIZE, preventing the buffer overflow. The corrected code should look like this
