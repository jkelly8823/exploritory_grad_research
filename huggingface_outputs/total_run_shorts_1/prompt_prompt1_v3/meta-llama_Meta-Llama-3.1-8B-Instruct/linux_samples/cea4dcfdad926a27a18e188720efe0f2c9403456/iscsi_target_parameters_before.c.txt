VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The strncpy function is used to copy a string into a buffer, but the buffer size is not checked for the second string copy operation. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is longer than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The strncpy function is used to copy a string into a buffer. However, the buffer size is not checked for the second string copy operation. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is longer than the buffer size. The strncpy function does not null-terminate the buffer if the source string is longer than the buffer size. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the buffer size should be checked before copying the string into the buffer. The strncpy function should be replaced with a safer function such as strlcpy or snprintf. Additionally, the buffer should be null-terminated after the string copy operation to prevent unexpected behavior. The corrected code should look like this: 
```c
strlcpy(extra_response->key, key, sizeof(extra_response->key));
strlcpy(extra_response->value
