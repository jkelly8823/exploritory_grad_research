VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the strlcpy function call for the extra_response->value field.
EXPLANATION: The strlcpy function does not guarantee that the destination buffer will be null-terminated if the source string is longer than the destination buffer. In this case, the source string is NOTUNDERSTOOD, which is a constant string. However, if this string is longer than the destination buffer, it could potentially cause a buffer overflow. This could lead to undefined behavior, including but not limited to, a segmentation fault or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the strscpy function instead of strlcpy, which guarantees that the destination buffer will be null-terminated. Alternatively, you can use the strncpy function and manually null-terminate the destination buffer. However, using strscpy is the recommended approach. Additionally, consider increasing the size of the extra_response->value field to prevent potential buffer overflows in the future.
