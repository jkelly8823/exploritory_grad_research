VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability in the restore_fp and restore_altivec functions.
EXPLANATION: The restore_fp and restore_altivec functions access and modify the thread's load_fp and load_vec variables, respectively, without checking if the thread's fp_state and vr_state structures have been freed. If the thread's fp_state or vr_state structures have been freed, accessing or modifying the thread's load_fp or load_vec variables could result in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add checks to ensure that the thread's fp_state and vr_state structures have not been freed before accessing or modifying the thread's load_fp and load_vec variables. This can be done by adding a check for the thread's fp_state and vr_state structures being NULL before accessing or modifying the thread's load_fp and load_vec variables. For example, in the restore_fp function, add a check for current->thread.fp_state being NULL before accessing it. Similarly, in the restore_altivec function, add a check for tsk->thread.vr_state being NULL before accessing it. This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability and ensure that the thread's load_fp
