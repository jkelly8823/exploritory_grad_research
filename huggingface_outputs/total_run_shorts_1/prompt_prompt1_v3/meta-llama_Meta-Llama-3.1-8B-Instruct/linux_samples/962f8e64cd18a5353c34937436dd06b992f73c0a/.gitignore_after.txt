 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a list of function names, likely intended for use in a Makefile or similar build system. There is no apparent code that could be exploited to introduce a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet consists of two lines, each containing a function name. The first line contains the string "rfi_flush", and the second line contains the string "entry_flush". These function names do not appear to be part of any executable code, and therefore do not pose a risk of introducing a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as there is no code that could be exploited to introduce a vulnerability. However, it is worth noting that the use of "rfi_flush" as a function name may be a potential security risk if the function is intended to handle user input, as it could potentially be used to introduce a remote code execution vulnerability. It is recommended to use a more descriptive and secure function name.  ```bash

rfi_flush() {
  # function implementation
}

entry_flush() {
  # function implementation
}
``` ```bash
