 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information disclosure vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation in the setup_rfi_flush function.
EXPLANATION: The setup_rfi_flush function takes two parameters, types and enable, but it does not validate the input values of these parameters. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the function's behavior and disclose sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the setup_rfi_flush function should be modified to include proper input validation for the types and enable parameters. This can be achieved by checking the values of these parameters against a set of expected values and returning an error if they are invalid. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it does not have any other security vulnerabilities.
