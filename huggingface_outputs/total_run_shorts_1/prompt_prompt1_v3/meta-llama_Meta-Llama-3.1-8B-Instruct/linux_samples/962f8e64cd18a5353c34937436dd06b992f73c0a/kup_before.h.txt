VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function allow_read_from_user() does not check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before reading from it. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the user is not allowed to access the memory location.
EXPLANATION: The function allow_read_from_user() takes a memory location and a size as input, but it does not check if the user is allowed to access the memory location. This can lead to a security vulnerability if the user is not allowed to access the memory location. The function should check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before reading from it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function allow_read_from_user() should be modified to check if the user is allowed to access the memory location before reading from it. This can be done by calling the function bad_kuap_fault() and checking its return value. If the return value is true, then the function should not read from the memory location. The modified function should look like this: static inline void allow_read_from_user(const void __user *from, unsigned long size) { if (bad_kuap_fault(NULL, (unsigned long)from, false))
