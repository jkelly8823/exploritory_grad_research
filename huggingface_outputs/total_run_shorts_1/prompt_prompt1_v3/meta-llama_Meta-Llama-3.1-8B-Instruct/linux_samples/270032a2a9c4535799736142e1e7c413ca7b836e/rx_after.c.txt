VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the use of the `switch` statement with a variable of type `rx->key->conf.cipher` which is not checked for null before dereferencing it.
EXPLANATION: The `switch` statement is used to handle different cipher types, but it does not check if `rx->key->conf.cipher` is null before dereferencing it. If `rx->key` or `conf` is null, this will result in a null pointer dereference, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a null check for `rx->key->conf.cipher` before the `switch` statement. This can be done by adding a simple `if` statement to check if `rx->key->conf.cipher` is null, and if so, return an error or handle it accordingly. For example: `if (rx->key->conf.cipher == NULL) return RX_DROP_UNUSABLE;` before the `switch` statement. Additionally, consider using a safer way to handle the cipher type, such as
