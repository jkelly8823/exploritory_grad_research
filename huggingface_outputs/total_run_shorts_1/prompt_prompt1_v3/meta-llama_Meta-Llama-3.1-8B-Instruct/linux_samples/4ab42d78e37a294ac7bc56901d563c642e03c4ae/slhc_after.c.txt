VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a double free vulnerability. This occurs when the kzalloc function fails to allocate memory, and the function then attempts to free the memory that was not allocated.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the rstate and tstate fields of the slcompress structure. If the allocation fails, the function will attempt to free the memory that was not allocated, resulting in a double free vulnerability. This is a serious issue, as it can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the kzalloc function should be replaced with a function that does not allocate memory if the allocation fails. Alternatively, the function could be modified to handle the allocation failure in a way that does not result in a double free. One possible solution is to use the kmalloc function instead of kzalloc, which will return NULL if the allocation fails. The function could then check for NULL and handle
