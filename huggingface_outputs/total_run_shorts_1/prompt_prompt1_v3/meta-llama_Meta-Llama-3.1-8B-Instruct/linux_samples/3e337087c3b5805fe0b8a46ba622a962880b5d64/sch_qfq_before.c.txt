VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in this code. The kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the new_agg struct, but if kzalloc fails, the function returns -ENOBUFS without freeing the memory that was previously allocated for new_agg. This means that if kzalloc fails, the memory allocated for new_agg will be leaked.
EXPLANATION: The kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the new_agg struct. If kzalloc fails, the function returns -ENOBUFS, but it does not free the memory that was previously allocated for new_agg. This is a use-after-free vulnerability because the function is trying to access the memory that was previously allocated for new_agg after it has been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should free the memory allocated for new_agg before returning -ENOBUFS. This can be done by adding a call to kfree(new_agg) before the return statement. The corrected code would look like this: if (new_agg == NULL) { /* create new aggregate */ new_agg = kzalloc(sizeof(*new_agg), GFP_ATOMIC); if (new_agg == NULL) {
