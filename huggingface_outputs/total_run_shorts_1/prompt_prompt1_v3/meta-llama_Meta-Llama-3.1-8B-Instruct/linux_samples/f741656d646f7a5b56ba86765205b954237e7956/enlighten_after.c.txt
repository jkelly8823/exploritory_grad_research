VULNERABLE_LINES: 27-30
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `HYPERVISOR_shared_info` pointer is assigned the value of `shared_info_page` which is a static pointer that is freed when the program exits. However, the `HYPERVISOR_shared_info` pointer is not updated when the program resumes, leading to a potential use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `HYPERVISOR_shared_info` pointer is assigned the value of `shared_info_page` in the `xen_hvm_init_shared_info` function. However, when the program resumes, the `shared_info_page` pointer is not updated, leading to a potential use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the `shared_info_page` pointer is freed when the program exits, but the `HYPERVISOR_shared_info` pointer still points to the freed memory location.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `HYPERVISOR_shared_info` pointer should be updated when the program resumes. This can be done by reassigning the `HYPERVISOR_shared_info` pointer to the new `shared_info_page` pointer in the `
