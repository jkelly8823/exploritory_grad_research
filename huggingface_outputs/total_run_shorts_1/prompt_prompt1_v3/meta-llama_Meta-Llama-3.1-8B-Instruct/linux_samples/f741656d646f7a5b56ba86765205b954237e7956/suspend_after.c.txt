VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of a variable 'cpu' without checking its bounds in the for_each_online_cpu() loop.
EXPLANATION: The for_each_online_cpu() loop iterates over all online CPUs, but the variable 'cpu' is not checked for its bounds. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the loop iterates over a large number of CPUs, potentially causing a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check for the 'cpu' variable, such as cpu < num_online_cpus(), to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum number of CPUs. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the CPU information.  ``` 
```c
for_each_online_cpu(cpu) {
	if (cpu >= num_online_cpus()) {
		// handle error or exit loop
	}
	//...
}
