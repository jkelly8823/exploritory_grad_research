VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The native_write_cr4 function does not properly synchronize access to the cr4_pinned_bits variable, which can lead to a data race when multiple threads attempt to write to the cr4 register simultaneously.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the use of the static_branch_likely macro, which is not atomic. This macro is used to check the state of the cr_pinning static key, but it does not guarantee that the check is executed before the subsequent write to the cr4 register. As a result, it is possible for multiple threads to execute the write operation simultaneously, leading to a data race.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a lock or other synchronization mechanism to ensure that access to the cr4_pinned_bits variable is properly synchronized. One possible solution is to use a spinlock to protect the critical section of code that writes to the cr4 register. The modified code would look something like this:
```c
static inline void native_write_cr4(unsigned long val)
{
	unsigned long bits_missing = 0;

	spin_lock(&cr4
