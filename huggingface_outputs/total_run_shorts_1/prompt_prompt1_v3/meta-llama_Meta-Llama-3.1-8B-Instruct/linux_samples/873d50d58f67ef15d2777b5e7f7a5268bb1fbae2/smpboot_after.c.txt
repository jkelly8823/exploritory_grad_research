VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition when accessing the cr4 register. The cr4 register is being modified in a non-atomic manner, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple threads or interrupts are accessing the register simultaneously.
EXPLANATION: The cr4 register is being modified in a non-atomic manner by using the |= operator, which is not thread-safe. This could lead to inconsistent state if multiple threads or interrupts are accessing the register simultaneously. Additionally, the code is using the __read_cr4 and __write_cr4 functions, which are not atomic either. This could lead to a race condition when accessing the cr4 register.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use atomic operations to access the cr4 register. This can be achieved by using the atomic_or and atomic_and functions from the <asm/atomic.h> header file. For example, the code could use atomic_or(&cr4, X86_CR4_PCIDE) instead of cr4 |= X86_CR4_PCIDE. Similarly, the code could use atomic_and(&cr4, cr4_pinned_bits) instead of cr
