VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function sco_send_frame() does not properly validate the length of the message before copying it into a buffer. This allows an attacker to send a message that is larger than the allocated buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function sco_send_frame() uses the memcpy_from_msg() function to copy the message into a buffer. However, it does not check if the length of the message is greater than the size of the buffer before copying it. This allows an attacker to send a message that is larger than the allocated buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow. The memcpy_from_msg() function will continue to copy data into the buffer until it reaches the end of the buffer, overwriting any existing data and potentially causing a crash or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add a check to ensure that the length of the message is not greater than the size of the buffer before copying it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the length of the message is greater than the size of the buffer, and returning an
