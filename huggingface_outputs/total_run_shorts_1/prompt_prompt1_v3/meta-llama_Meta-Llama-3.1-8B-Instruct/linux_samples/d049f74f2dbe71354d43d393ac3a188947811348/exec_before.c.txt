VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential information leak. The function get_dumpable() returns the dumpable status of a process, but it does not check if the process is a zombie process. A zombie process is a process that has finished execution but still has an entry in the process table. If a zombie process is passed to get_dumpable(), it will return the dumpable status of the zombie process, which could potentially leak sensitive information about the parent process.
EXPLANATION: The get_dumpable() function calls __get_dumpable(mm->flags), which returns the dumpable status of the process. However, it does not check if the process is a zombie process. A zombie process is a process that has finished execution but still has an entry in the process table. If a zombie process is passed to get_dumpable(), it will return the dumpable status of the zombie process, which could potentially leak sensitive information about the parent process.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the get_dumpable() function should be modified to check if the process is a zombie process before calling __get_dumpable(mm->flags). This can be done by checking
