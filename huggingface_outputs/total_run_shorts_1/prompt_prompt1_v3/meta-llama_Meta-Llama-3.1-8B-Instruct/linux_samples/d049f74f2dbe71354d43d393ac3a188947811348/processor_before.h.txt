VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information leak due to the use of the get_dumpable function which may return different values for processes with different uid/privileges.
EXPLANATION: The get_dumpable function is used to determine if a process is dumpable or not. However, this function may return different values for processes with different uid/privileges, which can lead to information leaks. The code is attempting to allocate a scratch area and set a flag to avoid leaking bits between processes, but the use of get_dumpable function introduces a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The get_dumpable function should be replaced with a function that is not affected by uid/privileges, such as a function that checks the process's capabilities. Alternatively, the code can be modified to handle the different return values of get_dumpable function to prevent information leaks.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the allocated scratch area is properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the "don't zap registers" flag is properly set and cleared to prevent register leaks.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the
