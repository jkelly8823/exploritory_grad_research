 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a Linux kernel module, and it defines some constants and function prototypes. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other common issues. However, it's worth noting that the code is using some arch-specific constants, which might be a potential issue if the code is not properly checked for different architectures.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure, but it's always a good practice to review the code carefully and consider potential issues that might arise from using arch-specific constants.  ```bash
