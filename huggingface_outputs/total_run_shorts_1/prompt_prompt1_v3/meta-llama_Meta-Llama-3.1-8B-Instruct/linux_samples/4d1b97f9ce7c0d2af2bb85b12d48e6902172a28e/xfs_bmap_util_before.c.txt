ANSWER: 
VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The goto statement is used without a corresponding label.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This can lead to undefined behavior when the program attempts to jump to the label.
EXPLANATION: The goto statement is used to jump to the label "error" but there is no label "error" in the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the goto statement with a proper error handling mechanism, such as returning an error code or throwing an exception. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a label "error" at the beginning of the function to match the goto statement. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: Consider using a more modern error handling approach, such as using a try-catch block or a function that returns an error code. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the goto statement and use a more structured approach to error handling.
