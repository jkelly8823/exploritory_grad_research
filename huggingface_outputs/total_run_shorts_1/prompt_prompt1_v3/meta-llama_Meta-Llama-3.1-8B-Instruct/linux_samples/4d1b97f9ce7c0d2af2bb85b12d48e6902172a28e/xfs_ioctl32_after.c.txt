VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `sizeof(type)` macro in the `_IOC` function call. This macro can potentially return a value that is larger than the actual size of the `type` variable, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `_IOC` function is used to define an I/O control operation. The `sizeof(type)` macro is used to determine the size of the `type` variable. However, if the `type` variable is a pointer, the `sizeof(type)` macro will return the size of the pointer, not the size of the data it points to. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `type` variable is not properly aligned or if the data it points to is not properly sized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `sizeof(*type)` macro instead of `sizeof(type)`. This will ensure that the size of the data pointed to by the `type` variable is used, rather than the size of the pointer itself. Additionally, the code should ensure that the `type` variable is properly aligned and that
