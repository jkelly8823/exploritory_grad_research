 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of the capable function which checks for capabilities at the time of the function call. This can lead to a situation where a process gains or loses a capability between the check and the actual operation, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.
EXPLANATION: The capable function checks the capabilities of the current process at the time of the function call. However, the process's capabilities can change between the time of the check and the actual operation. This can lead to a situation where a process gains or loses a capability between the check and the actual operation, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to check for capabilities, such as using a capability set or a lock to ensure that the capabilities are checked at the time of the operation, not at the time of the function call. One possible solution is to use the capget function to get the capability set of the current process and then check the capabilities from the set. This ensures that the capabilities are checked at the time
