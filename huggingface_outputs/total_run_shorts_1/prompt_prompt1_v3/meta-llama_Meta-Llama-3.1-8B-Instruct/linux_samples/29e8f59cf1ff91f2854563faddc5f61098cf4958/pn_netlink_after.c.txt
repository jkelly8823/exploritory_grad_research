VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the presence of a variable named "err" being declared twice. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The variable "err" is declared twice in the code snippet, which can cause issues with variable shadowing. This means that the second declaration of "err" will overwrite the first one, potentially leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the second declaration of "err" should be removed. The corrected code should only have one declaration of "err". This will prevent variable shadowing and ensure that the code behaves as expected. Additionally, it would be beneficial to rename the second variable to something else to avoid confusion. For example, the second variable could be renamed to "dst_err" to clearly indicate its purpose.  The corrected code should look like this: 

	int err;
	u8 pnaddr;

	if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_NET_ADMIN))
		return -EPERM;

	if (!netlink_capable(skb, CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
		return -EPERM;

	ASSERT_RTNL();

	u8 dst
