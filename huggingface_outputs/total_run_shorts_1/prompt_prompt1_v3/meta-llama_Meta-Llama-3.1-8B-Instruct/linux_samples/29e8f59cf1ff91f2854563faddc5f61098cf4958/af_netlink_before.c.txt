 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. The function netlink_capable() is called with a null pointer for the sock argument in the lines 9, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, and 32. This is because the variable sock is not checked for null before being passed to the function.
EXPLANATION: The function netlink_capable() is called with a null pointer for the sock argument in the lines 9, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, and 32. This is because the variable sock is not checked for null before being passed to the function. The function netlink_capable() will attempt to access the nl_table array with the index sock->sk->sk_protocol, which will result in a null pointer dereference if sock is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check for null before passing the sock argument to the net
