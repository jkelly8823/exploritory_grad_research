VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect length comparison.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the length of the skb is less than the length of the nlmsg. However, this comparison is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of a buffer overflow. A malicious user could potentially send a packet with a length greater than the actual buffer size, causing the program to access memory outside the bounds of the buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if the length of the skb is less than or equal to the length of the nlmsg. This can be done by changing the comparison operator from '<' to '<='.
```python
def get_user_input():
    user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
    return user_input

def main():
    user_name = get_user_input()
    print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
