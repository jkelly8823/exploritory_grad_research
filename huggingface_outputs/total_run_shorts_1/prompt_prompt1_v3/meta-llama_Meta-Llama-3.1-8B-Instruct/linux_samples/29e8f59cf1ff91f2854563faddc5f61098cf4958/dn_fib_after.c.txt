VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array to store dynamic data.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a fixed-size array `attrs` to store dynamic data. The size of the array is determined by the constant `RTA_MAX+1`, which may not be sufficient to hold all the attributes. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of attributes exceeds the size of the array. Additionally, the code snippet uses the same variable name `attrs` for two different arrays, which can cause confusion and make the code harder to understand.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can grow as needed to store the attributes. The code should also use a unique variable name for each array to avoid confusion. For example, the code can use `attrs1` and `attrs2` instead of `attrs` for the two different arrays. Additionally, the code should check the size of the array before accessing its elements to prevent buffer overflows. The code can use the `sizeof` operator to get the size of the
