 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the re-declaration of the variable 'limhops' and 'err'. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'limhops' and 'err' are re-declared in the same scope, which can cause issues with the code's logic and potentially lead to bugs. This is because the re-declaration of the variables can overwrite the values of the previously declared variables, leading to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the re-declaration of the variables 'limhops' and 'err'. This can be done by removing the lines where the variables are re-declared. The corrected code should look like this: 
```c
	u8 limhops = 0;
	int err = 0;

	if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
		return -EPERM;

	if (nlmsg_len(nlh) < sizeof(*r))
		return -EINVAL;
``` 
```c
	u8 limhops = 0;
	int err = 0;

	if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))
