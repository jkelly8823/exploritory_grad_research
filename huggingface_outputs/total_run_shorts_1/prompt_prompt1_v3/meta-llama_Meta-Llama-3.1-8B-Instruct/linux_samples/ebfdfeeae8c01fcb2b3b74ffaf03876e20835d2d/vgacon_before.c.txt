VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `count` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `count` variable is not checked to ensure it does not exceed the size of the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->data` buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `count` is greater than the size of the buffer, potentially allowing an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack or heap.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the `count` variable to ensure it does not exceed the size of the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->data` buffer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if `count` is less than or equal to the size of the buffer before the loop. For example: `if (count <= vgacon_scrollback_cur->size) {... }`. Additionally, consider using a safer function like `scr_memcpyw_s` that takes a size parameter to prevent buffer overflows.  The line `p = (void *) (c->vc_origin + t * c->vc_size_row);` is also a potential issue as it does
