 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when copying data into the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->data` array.
EXPLANATION: The `scr_memcpyw` function is copying `c->vc_size_row` bytes from the `p` pointer into the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->data` array, starting from the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->tail` index. However, there is no check to ensure that the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->tail` index plus the number of bytes to be copied does not exceed the size of the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->data` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->tail` index is close to the end of the array and `c->vc_size_row` is large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->tail` index plus the number of bytes to be copied does not exceed the size of the `vgacon_scrollback_cur->data` array. This can be done
