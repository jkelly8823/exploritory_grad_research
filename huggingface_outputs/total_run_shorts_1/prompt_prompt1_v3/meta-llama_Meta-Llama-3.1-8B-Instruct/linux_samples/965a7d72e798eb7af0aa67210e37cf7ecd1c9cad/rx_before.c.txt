VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The pn array is not checked for its size before being incremented, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the pn array is not large enough to hold the incremented value.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is part of a function that handles IEEE 802.11 frame reassembly. The pn array is used to store the packet number (PN) of the last fragment of a frame. However, the code does not check the size of the pn array before incrementing its elements. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the pn array is not large enough to hold the incremented value. A buffer overflow can cause the program to access memory outside the bounds of the pn array, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the size of the pn array before incrementing its elements. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the pn array is large enough to hold the incremented value. For example, the code can be modified as follows: for (i = IEEE80211_CCMP_P
