VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking on the `new_bssid` array.
EXPLANATION: The `new_bssid` array is declared with a fixed size of `ETH_ALEN` (6 bytes), but the `sub` loop does not check the bounds of the `elem->data` array when copying data into `new_bssid`. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the `new_bssid` array and cause undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the `sub` loop to ensure that the `new_bssid` array is not overflowed. For example, use `memcpy` with a length of `ETH_ALEN` to copy data into `new_bssid`. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated buffer, to store the BSSID data.  Also, consider using a safer method to copy data, such as `memcpy` instead of manual copying.  Consider using a safer method to check the bounds of the `elem->data` array, such as using `strncpy` instead of manual bounds checking.  Consider using a safer method to check the bounds
