VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when accessing the `elem->data` array.
EXPLANATION: The `for_each_element` function does not perform any bounds checking on the `elem->data` array, allowing an attacker to potentially access memory outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the `for_each_element` function to ensure that the index does not exceed the size of the `elem->data` array. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array, to store the data. The `new_bssid` array should also be initialized with a size that is sufficient to hold the maximum possible value of `ETH_ALEN`. For example: `u8 new_bssid[ETH_ALEN] = {0};`. This will prevent potential buffer overflows when accessing the `new_bssid` array.  The `index` variable should also be checked to ensure it does not exceed the bounds of the `elem->data` array.
