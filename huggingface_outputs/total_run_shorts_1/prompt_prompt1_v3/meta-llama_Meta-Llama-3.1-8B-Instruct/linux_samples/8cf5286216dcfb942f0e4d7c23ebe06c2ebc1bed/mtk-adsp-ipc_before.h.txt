VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is possible if the ipc pointer is freed after it is passed to mtk_adsp_ipc_send, but before mtk_adsp_ipc_send has completed.
EXPLANATION: The mtk_adsp_ipc_send function is called with the ipc pointer, but the ipc pointer is not checked for validity after the function call. If the ipc pointer is freed after the function call but before it completes, then the ipc pointer will be pointing to freed memory, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The mtk_adsp_ipc_send function should check the validity of the ipc pointer after the function call to ensure it has not been freed. This can be done by adding a check for ipc->private_data before accessing it. If ipc->private_data is NULL, then the ipc pointer has been freed and the function should return an error. Additionally, the mtk_adsp_ipc_set_data function should check for NULL before assigning data to ipc->private_data to prevent a NULL pointer dereference.  The mtk_adsp_ipc_get_data function should also check for NULL before returning ipc->private_data to prevent a NULL
