 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking in the receiver_port_reg_store function.
EXPLANATION: The receiver_port_reg_store function does not perform any bounds checking on the reg parameter, which is a hrt_address. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the receiver_port_reg_store function to ensure that the reg parameter is within the valid range of the control register. This can be done by checking the value of reg against the maximum allowed value for the control register. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a uint32_t, to represent the control register address.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking in the receiver_port_reg_load function.
EXPLANATION: The receiver_port_reg_load function does not perform any bounds checking on the reg parameter, which is a hrt_address. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the receiver_port_reg_load function to
