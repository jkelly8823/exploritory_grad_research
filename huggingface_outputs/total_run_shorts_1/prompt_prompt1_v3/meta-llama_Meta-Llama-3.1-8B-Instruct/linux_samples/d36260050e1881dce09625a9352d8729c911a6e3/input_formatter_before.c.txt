VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system that deals with input formatting. It defines a boolean array `HIVE_IF_BIN_COPY` and a function `input_formatter_rst` that takes an `input_formatter_ID_t` as an argument. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). However, it is worth noting that the code snippet is incomplete and may be part of a larger file or project.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any fixes. However, it is recommended to review the complete code file or project to ensure that there are no other potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is a good practice to follow secure coding guidelines and best practices to prevent potential security issues.  The use of a boolean array to store configuration data may be a potential issue if the array is not properly initialized or if the values are not validated. It is recommended to consider using a more robust data structure such as a struct or a class to store
