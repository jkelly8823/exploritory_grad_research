VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system that handles input formatting. It defines a boolean array `HIVE_IF_BIN_COPY` and a function `input_formatter_rst` that takes an `input_formatter_ID_t` as an argument. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or format string vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be safe and does not require any changes. However, it would be beneficial to review the code in the context of the larger system to ensure that it is properly integrated and meets the system's requirements.  The comment at the top of the code snippet suggests that the `HIVE_INPUT_SWITCH_SELECT_STR_TO_MEM` macro should be defined elsewhere, but this is not a vulnerability in the code snippet itself.  It is a potential issue that should be addressed in the larger codebase.  The comment also suggests that the `HIVE_IF_BIN_COPY` array should be defined in a different header file, but this is not a vulnerability in the code snippet.  It
