VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of a pointer to a local variable.
EXPLANATION: The variable `debug_data` is a local variable, and its address is being stored in the pointer `debug_data_ptr`. However, the address of `debug_data_ptr` is being passed to the `debug_buffer_init` function, which can potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the address is not properly validated. This is because the address of a local variable is not guaranteed to be valid once the function returns.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically allocated buffer instead of a local variable. Alternatively, ensure that the address passed to the `debug_buffer_init` function is properly validated to prevent buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a stack-based buffer, to store the debug data.  The line `hrt_address debug_buffer_address = (hrt_address)-1;` is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it is assigning a negative value to a pointer. This could potentially cause a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.  The line `hrt_vaddress debug_buffer
