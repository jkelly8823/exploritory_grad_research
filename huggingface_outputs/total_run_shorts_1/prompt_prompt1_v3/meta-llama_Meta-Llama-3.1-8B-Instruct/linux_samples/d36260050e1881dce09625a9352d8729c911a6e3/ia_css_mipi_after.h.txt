 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a header file containing function declarations for the ia_css_mipi_frame_enable_check_on_size and ia_css_mipi_frame_calculate_size functions. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a header file that defines two function declarations. The functions are declared with their parameters and return types, but the function bodies are not provided. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues. The use of const correctness and the declaration of function parameters with their types suggests a focus on code quality and maintainability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the implementation of the functions declared in this header file to ensure that they are implemented correctly and securely.  */  VULNERABLE: NO
