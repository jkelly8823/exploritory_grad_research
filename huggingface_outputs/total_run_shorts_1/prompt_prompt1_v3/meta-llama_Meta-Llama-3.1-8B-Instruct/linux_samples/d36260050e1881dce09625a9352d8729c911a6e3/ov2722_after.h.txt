VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to a missing bounds check on the width and height of the resolution.
EXPLANATION: The ov2722_res_preview array is defined with a fixed size, but the width and height of the resolution are not checked against this size. This allows for the possibility of a buffer overflow if a resolution with a width or height greater than the array size is added.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the width and height of the resolution do not exceed the size of the array. This can be done by adding a check before adding a new resolution to the array, such as: if (width > OV2722_RES_PREVIEW_MAX_WIDTH || height > OV2722_RES_PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT) { /* handle error */ } where OV2722_RES_PREVIEW_MAX_WIDTH and OV2722_RES_PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT are the maximum allowed values for the width and height. Additionally, consider using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized elements.  ```c
