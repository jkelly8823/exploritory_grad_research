VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `offsetof` macro to calculate the offset of a struct member without checking the size of the struct.
EXPLANATION: The `offsetof` macro is used to calculate the offset of the `host2sp_num_mipi_frames` member in the `host_sp_communication` struct. However, this macro does not take into account the size of the struct, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the struct is not properly aligned. This can be exploited by an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to calculate the offset, such as using a compiler-specific intrinsic or a library function that takes into account the size of the struct. Additionally, the code should ensure that the struct is properly aligned to prevent buffer overflows. One possible solution is to use the `offsetof` macro with the `__alignof` keyword to ensure that the struct is properly aligned. For example: `offset = (unsigned int)__alignof(host_sp_communication) * offsetof(host
