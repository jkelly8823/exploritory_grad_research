VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function inputfifo_determine_type has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the input_format parameter.
EXPLANATION: The function inputfifo_determine_type takes an enum ia_css_stream_format as input and uses it to determine the type of mipi data. However, the function does not check if the input_format is within the valid range of enum ia_css_stream_format. If an invalid value is passed, the function will still attempt to use it, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the input_format parameter to ensure it is within the valid range of enum ia_css_stream_format. This can be done by using a switch statement or a series of if-else statements to check the value of input_format and return an error or a default value if it is invalid. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a uint32_t, to represent the input_format parameter.
