VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the req_out_info array.
EXPLANATION: The req_out_info array is declared with a size of IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS, but it is not checked if the index passed to the array is within the valid range. This can lead to a buffer overflow if an index greater than IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS is passed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the req_out_info array to ensure that the index passed is within the valid range. This can be done by checking if the index is less than IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS before accessing the array. For example: if (index < IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS) {... } else {... }  handle the error case.  Also, consider using a safer data structure such as a vector or a linked list to avoid buffer overflow issues.  Additionally, consider using a safer function to copy the data into the array, such as memcpy_s, to prevent buffer overflow.  Finally, consider using a safer function to access the array, such as array[index], to prevent buffer overflow.  It is also
