VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The duplicated field 'format' in the struct ia_css_stream_isys_stream_config is a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The duplicated field 'format' in the struct ia_css_stream_isys_stream_config is a vulnerability because it can lead to unexpected behavior when accessing the field. This is because the second field 'format' will overwrite the first field 'format' in memory, causing the first field to be lost.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the duplicated field 'format' from the struct ia_css_stream_isys_stream_config. If the intention is to have two fields with the same name, consider using a different name for one of the fields to avoid confusion.
