VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the out_infos array.
EXPLANATION: The out_infos array is being assigned a value without checking its bounds, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the array is not large enough to hold the assigned value. This can result in undefined behavior and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the out_infos array before assigning a value to it. This can be done by checking the size of the array and ensuring that the assigned value does not exceed the array's capacity. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array or a vector, to avoid buffer overflow issues.
