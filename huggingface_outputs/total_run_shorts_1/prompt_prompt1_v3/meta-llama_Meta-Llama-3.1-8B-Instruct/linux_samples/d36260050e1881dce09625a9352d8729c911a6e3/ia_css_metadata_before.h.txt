 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a struct definition for a metadata configuration. It contains two members: data_type and resolution. The data_type is an enumeration of possible data types for CSI-2 embedded data, and the resolution is a struct representing the resolution of the sensor. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. This code snippet appears to be a well-structured and safe piece of code. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it aligns with the project's coding standards and best practices. Additionally, it is recommended to consider using a code review tool to catch any potential issues that may have been missed.  Please note that this code snippet is a struct definition and does not contain any executable code, therefore it is not possible to identify any vulnerabilities.  However, if the struct is used in a way that allows for user input or data to be passed to it, then it could potentially be vulnerable to certain types of attacks.
