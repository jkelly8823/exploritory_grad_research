VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check if the driver's tlb_flush_range function is NULL before calling it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the driver's tlb_flush_all function is NULL, but it does not perform the same check for the tlb_flush_range function. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the driver does not provide a tlb_flush_range function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if the driver's tlb_flush_range function is NULL before calling it, and return an error if it is NULL. The recommended fix is to add a check for tlb_flush_range function before calling it, similar to the check for tlb_flush_all function. For example: if (!driver->tlb_flush_range) { dev_err(atomisp_dev, "tlb_flush_range operation not provided.\n"); return -EINVAL; }. This will prevent a null pointer dereference and ensure that the code handles the case where the driver does not provide a tlb_flush_range function.  ```c
```c
int isp_tlb_flush_range(struct isp_tlb *tl
