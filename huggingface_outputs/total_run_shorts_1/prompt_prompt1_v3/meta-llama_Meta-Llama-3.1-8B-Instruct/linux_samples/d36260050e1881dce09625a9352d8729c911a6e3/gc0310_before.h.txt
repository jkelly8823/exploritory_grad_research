VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the width and height fields of the gc0310_resolution struct.
EXPLANATION: The width and height fields of the gc0310_resolution struct are assigned values that are larger than the maximum allowed values for these fields. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the struct is used to access memory locations that are outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the width and height fields of the gc0310_resolution struct to prevent buffer overflows. For example, you can add a check to ensure that the width and height values are within the valid range before assigning them to the struct fields. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as uint16_t, to represent the width and height values.
