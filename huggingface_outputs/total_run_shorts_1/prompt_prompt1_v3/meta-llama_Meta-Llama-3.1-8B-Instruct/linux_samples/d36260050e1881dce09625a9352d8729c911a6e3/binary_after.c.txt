VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the out_info array.
EXPLANATION: The out_info array is declared to be able to hold IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS elements, but the function ia_css_binary_fill_info is called with a pointer to an array of IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS elements. However, the function does not check if the out_info array is full before assigning a value to it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the array is full.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the out_info array before assigning a value to it. This can be done by checking if the array is full before assigning a value to it. For example, you can add a check like this: if (out_info!= NULL && out_info < IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS) {... }. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a linked list or a vector to store the frame info. This will make it easier to manage the memory and prevent buffer overflows.  Also, consider using a safer way to pass the out_info array to the function
