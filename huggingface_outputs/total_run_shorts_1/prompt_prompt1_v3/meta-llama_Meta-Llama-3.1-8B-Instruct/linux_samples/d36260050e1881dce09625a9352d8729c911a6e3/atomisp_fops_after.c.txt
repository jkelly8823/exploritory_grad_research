 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is due to the fact that the isp structure is being accessed without checking if it is null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if isp is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Before accessing the isp structure, check if it is null and handle the case where it is null. This can be done by adding a null check before accessing the isp structure. For example: if (isp!= NULL) {... } else {... }.
