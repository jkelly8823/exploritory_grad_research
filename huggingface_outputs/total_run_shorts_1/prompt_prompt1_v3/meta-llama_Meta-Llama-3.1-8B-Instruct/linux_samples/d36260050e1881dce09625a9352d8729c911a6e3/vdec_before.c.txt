VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of an uninitialized variable 'i' in the for loop.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'i' is used in the for loop without being initialized. This can lead to undefined behavior when the loop is executed. The loop iterates over the'size' elements of the 'fmt' array, but the value of 'i' is not known beforehand. This can cause the loop to access memory outside the bounds of the array, resulting in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Initialize the variable 'i' before using it in the for loop. The recommended fix is to add the line 'int i = 0;' before the for loop. This ensures that 'i' is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, preventing the buffer overflow vulnerability.  ```c
int i = 0;
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
