VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking on the input string.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a function call to `snprintf` without checking the length of the input string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size. The `snprintf` function does not perform bounds checking, and it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the formatted string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that the input string is not longer than the buffer size before calling `snprintf`. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to get the length of the input string and comparing it to the buffer size. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, consider using a larger buffer or truncating the input string to fit within the buffer. Additionally, consider using a safer function like `snprintf` with a maximum length argument to prevent buffer overflows.
