VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to a fixed-size array being used to store a large amount of data.
EXPLANATION: The array g_pyramid is declared with a fixed size of 8x8, but the data being stored in it is larger than the allocated space. This can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Increase the size of the array g_pyramid to accommodate the large amount of data being stored in it. Alternatively, consider using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized data. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the data being stored does not exceed the allocated space.  Please note that the size of the array is 4x4, not 8x8 as mentioned in the description. The size of the array is 4x4, not 8x8 as mentioned in the description.
