VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a variable-length array (VLA) in the function parameter list.
EXPLANATION: The use of a variable-length array (VLA) in the function parameter list can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This is because the size of the array is determined at runtime, and if the size is larger than expected, it can cause the buffer to overflow, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a fixed-size array or a dynamically allocated array with bounds checking. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a linked list or a vector, to avoid the use of VLAs altogether. It is also recommended to use a static analysis tool to detect similar vulnerabilities in the codebase.  The use of VLAs in the function parameter list is a security risk and should be avoided.  The code should be modified to use a safer data structure.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that the use of VLAs is not a security risk.  The code should be tested to ensure that it does not contain any buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  The code
