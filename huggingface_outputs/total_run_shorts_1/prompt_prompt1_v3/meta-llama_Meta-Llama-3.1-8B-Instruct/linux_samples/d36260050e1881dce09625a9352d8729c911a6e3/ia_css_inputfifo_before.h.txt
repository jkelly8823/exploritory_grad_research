VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function ia_css_inputfifo_start_frame has a missing parameter, width, which is required by the function ia_css_inputfifo_send_line and ia_css_inputfifo_send_embedded_line.
EXPLANATION: The function ia_css_inputfifo_start_frame is called before the function ia_css_inputfifo_send_line or ia_css_inputfifo_send_embedded_line. However, the function ia_css_inputfifo_start_frame does not take the width parameter, which is required by the function ia_css_inputfifo_send_line and ia_css_inputfifo_send_embedded_line. This can cause a segmentation fault or undefined behavior when the function ia_css_inputfifo_send_line or ia_css_inputfifo_send_embedded_line is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add the width parameter to the function ia_css_inputfifo_start_frame. The corrected function should look like this: void ia_css_inputfifo_start_frame(unsigned int ch_id, enum ia_css_stream_format input_format, bool two_ppc, unsigned int width);. This will ensure that the width parameter is passed to the function ia_css_inputfifo_start_frame and can be used by the function ia_css_inputfifo_send_line and ia_css_inputfifo_send
