VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The size of the buffer is set to 32, but the size of the handle table is set to 1000. This means that if the handle table is filled to capacity, the hmmbufferpool will overflow and potentially cause a security breach.
EXPLANATION: The code defines a handle table with a fixed size of 1000, but the hmmbufferpool has a size of 32. This means that if the handle table is filled to capacity, the hmmbufferpool will overflow and potentially cause a security breach. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow attack, where an attacker can manipulate the size of the buffer to cause a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the hmmbufferpool should be increased to match the size of the handle table. Alternatively, the handle table should be dynamically allocated to prevent overflow. Additionally, input validation should be implemented to prevent an attacker from manipulating the size of the buffer.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all buffers are properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential security
