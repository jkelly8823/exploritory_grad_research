VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential infinite recursion vulnerability. The function resizer_configure_in_continious_mode() calls itself recursively without any base case, which can lead to a stack overflow.
EXPLANATION: The function resizer_configure_in_continious_mode() calls itself recursively when the condition ipipeif_source == IPIPEIF_OUTPUT_RESIZER is met. However, there is no base case to stop the recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow. This is a classic example of a recursive function without a base case, which can cause a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, we need to add a base case to stop the recursion. We can do this by checking if the condition ipipeif_source == IPIPEIF_OUTPUT_RESIZER is met, and if so, return a value instead of calling the function recursively. For example, we can add a return statement after the if condition, like this: if (ipipeif_source == IPIPEIF_OUTPUT_RESIZER) return 0;. This will prevent the function from calling itself recursively and avoid the potential stack overflow. Alternatively, we can refactor the function to use a loop
