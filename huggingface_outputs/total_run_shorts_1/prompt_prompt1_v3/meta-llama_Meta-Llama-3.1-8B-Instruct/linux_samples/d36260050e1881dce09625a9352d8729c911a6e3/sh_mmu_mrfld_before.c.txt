 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The function sh_set_pd_base() does not check if the pte is null before calling atomisp_css_mmu_set_page_table_base_index() with it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if pte is null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check for pte before calling atomisp_css_mmu_set_page_table_base_index(). For example, if (pte!= NULL) {... } else {... } to handle the case where pte is null.  Also, consider adding a check to ensure that pte is not a null pointer before passing it to HOST_ADDRESS().  This could be done by adding a check like if (pte!= NULL) {... } else {... } before calling HOST_ADDRESS().  This would prevent a null pointer dereference in the case where pte is null.  It would also be a good idea to add a check to ensure that pte is not a null pointer before passing it to sh_pte_to_phys().  This could be done by adding a check like if (pte!= NULL) {... }
