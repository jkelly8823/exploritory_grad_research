 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file containing function declarations for utility functions. The functions are declared with proper documentation and parameter descriptions. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). The use of extern keyword for function declarations suggests that the functions are defined elsewhere in the codebase.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the code could benefit from more detailed documentation and comments to improve its maintainability and readability.  The use of enum ia_css_stream_format suggests that the code is using an enumeration type to represent different stream formats. It would be beneficial to include a description of the possible values for this enumeration in the documentation.  The code does not appear to be vulnerable to any known security issues, but it is always a good practice to keep the code up to date with the latest security patches and
