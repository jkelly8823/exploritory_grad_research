VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the input parameter "to".
EXPLANATION: The function ia_css_dpc2_encode() takes a pointer to a struct ia_css_isp_dpc2_params as input, but it does not check if the pointer is valid or if the struct has enough space to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than the allocated space.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the input parameter "to" to ensure that it points to a valid struct and that the struct has enough space to hold the data. This can be done by checking the size of the struct and the size of the input data before copying the data into the struct. Additionally, consider using a safer function to copy the data, such as memcpy_s() or strcpy_s(), which can help prevent buffer overflows.  Also, consider using a memory sanitizer or a tool like AddressSanitizer to detect buffer overflows at runtime.  Consider using a static analysis tool to detect buffer overflows at compile time.  Consider using a code review process to
