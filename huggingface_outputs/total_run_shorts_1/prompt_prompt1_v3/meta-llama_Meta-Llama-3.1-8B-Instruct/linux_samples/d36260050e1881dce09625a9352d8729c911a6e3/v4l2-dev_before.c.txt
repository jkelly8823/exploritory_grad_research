 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The WARN_ON macro is used to check if the video_device array is already occupied by another device. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a race condition. The check is performed after the vdev->minor and vdev->index have been set, but before the video_device[vdev->minor] has been updated. This means that another thread could potentially access the video_device array and set the video_device[vdev->minor] to a different device before this thread updates it, resulting in a race condition.
