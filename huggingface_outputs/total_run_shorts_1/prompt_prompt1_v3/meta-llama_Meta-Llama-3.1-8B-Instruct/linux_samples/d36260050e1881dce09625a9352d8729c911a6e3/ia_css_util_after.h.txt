 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file for a C library. It contains function declarations for utility functions related to input formats. The functions are declared with proper documentation and include parameter descriptions. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other common issues. The use of extern keyword for function declarations suggests that the functions are defined elsewhere in the codebase.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and well-structured. However, it is always a good practice to review the implementation of these functions in the corresponding source files to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using a secure coding standard and code review process to ensure the overall security of the codebase.  The use of enum atomisp_input_format suggests that the input format is being validated, which is a good practice. However, it would be even better to validate the input format at multiple points in the code to ensure that it is correct.  Consider adding additional validation checks in the functions that use this enum
