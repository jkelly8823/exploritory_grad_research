VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking on the reg parameter in the receiver_port_reg_store function.
EXPLANATION: The receiver_port_reg_store function takes a reg parameter of type hrt_address, which is a 64-bit integer. However, the function does not check if the reg parameter is within the valid range of addresses. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker passes an invalid address. Additionally, the receiver_port_reg_load function also lacks bounds checking on the reg parameter, which could also lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking on the reg parameter in both the receiver_port_reg_store and receiver_port_reg_load functions. This can be done by checking if the reg parameter is within the valid range of addresses before accessing the memory location. For example, the code could add a check to ensure that the reg parameter is greater than or equal to 0 and less than a maximum valid address. Additionally, the code should also consider using a safer data type, such as a pointer, to represent the reg parameter. This
