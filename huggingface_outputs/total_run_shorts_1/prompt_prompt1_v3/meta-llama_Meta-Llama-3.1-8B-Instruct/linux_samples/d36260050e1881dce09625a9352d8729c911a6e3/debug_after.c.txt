VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of a pointer arithmetic operation that may result in an out-of-bounds access.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a line where a pointer is being decremented by 1, which may lead to an out-of-bounds access if the original address is already at the lowest possible value. This can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safe and validated method to calculate the address, such as using a buffer size check or a safe pointer arithmetic operation. Additionally, consider using a more robust data type, such as a size_t, to represent the address to avoid potential overflows.
