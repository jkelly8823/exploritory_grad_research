VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function ia_css_dpc2_encode does not check if the pointer to is not NULL before dereferencing it.
EXPLANATION: The function ia_css_dpc2_encode takes a pointer to a struct ia_css_isp_dpc2_params as its first argument. However, it does not check if this pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. This can lead to a segmentation fault if the pointer is NULL.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function should check if the pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement at the beginning of the function. For example: if (to == NULL) { return; } or if (to!= NULL) { /* function body */ } else { /* handle NULL pointer */ } .
