VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a header file containing function declarations for the ia_css_mipi_frame_enable_check_on_size and ia_css_mipi_frame_calculate_size functions. There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a header file that defines two functions: ia_css_mipi_frame_enable_check_on_size and ia_css_mipi_frame_calculate_size. The functions are declared with their parameters and return types, but the function bodies are not provided. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues. The functions appear to be designed to calculate the size of a mipi frame and check if it is enabled, which does not seem to be related to any known security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the function implementations in the corresponding source files to ensure that they do not contain any vulnerabilities. Additionally, the use of unsigned integers for size calculations may not be suitable for all cases, and
