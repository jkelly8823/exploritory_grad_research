VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the 'i' variable in the for loop.
EXPLANATION: The 'i' variable is incremented without checking if it is within the bounds of the'size' array. This can lead to accessing memory outside the array, resulting in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the for loop to ensure that 'i' does not exceed the size of the'size' array. This can be done by adding a condition to check if 'i' is less than'size' before accessing 'fmt[i]'. For example: if (i < size && fmt[i].type!= type) continue;. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or list, to avoid buffer overflow issues.  ```c
int venc_v4l2_to_hfi(int id, int value)
{
    int i;
    int k = 0;
    int size = 0;
    struct v4l2_format fmt[10];
    struct v4l2_format *pfmt = NULL;

    pfmt = v
