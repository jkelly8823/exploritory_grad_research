VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when assigning values to the buffer_type_to_queue_id_map array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a loop that iterates over the buffer_type_to_queue_id_map array without checking the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the loop iterates beyond the end of the array, potentially causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the loop to ensure that it does not iterate beyond the end of the array. This can be done by checking the value of i against the size of the array before assigning a value to the buffer_type_to_queue_id_map array. For example: if (i < SH_CSS_MAX_SP_THREADS && i < IA_CSS_NUM_DYNAMIC_BUFFER_TYPE) {... }. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that provides bounds checking, to store the buffer type to queue ID mapping.
