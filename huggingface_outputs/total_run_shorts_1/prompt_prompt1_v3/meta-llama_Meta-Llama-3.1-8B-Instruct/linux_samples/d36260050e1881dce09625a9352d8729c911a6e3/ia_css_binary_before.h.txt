 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable-length array (VLA) in the ia_css_binary_fill_info function. The out_info array is declared with a size of IA_CSS_BINARY_MAX_OUTPUT_PORTS, but its size is not checked before it is used. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the number of output ports exceeds the maximum allowed size.
EXPLANATION: The use of a VLA in the ia_css_binary_fill_info function is a potential security risk because it allows the size of the array to be determined at runtime. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the array is not checked before it is used. In this case, the size of the out_info array is not checked before it is used, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the out_info array should be checked before it is used. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the number of output ports does not exceed the maximum allowed size. Additionally, the use of a VLA should be avoided in favor of a fixed-size array to prevent
