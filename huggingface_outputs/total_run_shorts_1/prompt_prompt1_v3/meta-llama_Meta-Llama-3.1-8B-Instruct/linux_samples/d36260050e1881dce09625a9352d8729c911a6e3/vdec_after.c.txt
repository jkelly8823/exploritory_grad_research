VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the 'i' variable in the for loop.
EXPLANATION: The 'i' variable is incremented without checking if it is within the bounds of the'size' variable. This can lead to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a bounds check to ensure that 'i' does not exceed'size' before accessing 'fmt[i]'. This can be done by adding a condition to the for loop, such as 'for (i = 0; i < size && i < MAX_SIZE; i++)'. Replace 'MAX_SIZE' with the maximum allowed size of the buffer. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or array, to store the 'fmt' array to prevent buffer overflows.  ```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    if width <= 0 or height <= 0:
        return 0
    return width * height

def calculate_perimeter(width, height):
    if width <= 0 or height <= 0:
        return 0
