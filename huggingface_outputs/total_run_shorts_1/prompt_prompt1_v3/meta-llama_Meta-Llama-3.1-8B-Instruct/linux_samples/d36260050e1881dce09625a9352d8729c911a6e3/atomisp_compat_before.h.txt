VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function atomisp_css_irq_translate() has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the input parameter *infos.
EXPLANATION: The function atomisp_css_irq_translate() takes a pointer to an unsigned int as an input parameter. However, there is no check to ensure that the pointer points to a valid memory location or that the value being pointed to is within a valid range. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the input parameter is not properly validated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the input parameter *infos to ensure that it points to a valid memory location and that the value being pointed to is within a valid range. This can be done by checking the value of *infos against a known valid range and returning an error if it is outside of that range. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a struct, to store the information being passed to the function. This would help to prevent buffer overflows and make the code more secure.
