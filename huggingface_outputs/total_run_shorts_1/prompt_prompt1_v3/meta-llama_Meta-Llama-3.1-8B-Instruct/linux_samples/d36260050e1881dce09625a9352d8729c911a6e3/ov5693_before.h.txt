VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking on the ov5693_res_preview array.
EXPLANATION: The ov5693_res_preview array is declared with a fixed size, but the code does not perform any bounds checking when accessing its elements. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the index used to access the array is out of bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the index used to access the ov5693_res_preview array is within its valid range. This can be done by checking if the index is less than the size of the array before accessing it. For example: if (index < sizeof(ov5693_res_preview) / sizeof(ov5693_res_preview[0])) {... }.

    let u = &v;
    let t = &u;
    let s = &t;
