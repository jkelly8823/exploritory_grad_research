VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds array access vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The loop in the function `atomisp_find_in_fmt_conv_by_atomisp_in_fmt` iterates until `i < ARRAY_SIZE(atomisp_in_fmt_conv) - 1`, which means it will access the last element of the array at index `ARRAY_SIZE(atomisp_in_fmt_conv) - 2`. This is a potential out-of-bounds access if the array has only one element, because the loop will not terminate until it tries to access the non-existent element at index `ARRAY_SIZE(atomisp_in_fmt_conv)`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Change the loop condition to `i < ARRAY_SIZE(atomisp_in_fmt_conv)` to prevent the out-of-bounds access. Alternatively, use a safer loop construct like `for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(atomisp_in_fmt_conv); i++)` to avoid this issue. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the array index is within valid range before accessing it.  The loop should be changed to `for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(atomisp_in_fmt_conv); i++)` to prevent the
