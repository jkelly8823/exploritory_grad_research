VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to a fixed-size array being used to store a large amount of data.
EXPLANATION: The array g_pyramid is declared with a fixed size of 8x8, but the data being stored in it is larger than the allocated space. This can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Increase the size of the array g_pyramid to accommodate the large amount of data being stored in it. Alternatively, consider using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle large amounts of data more efficiently.  Consider using a safer data type such as a std::vector in C++.  Consider using a safer data type such as a bytearray in Python.  Consider using a safer data type such as a list in Java.
