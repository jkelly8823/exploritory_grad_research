VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The condition `delta < CEC_TIM_DATA_BIT_TOTAL_MIN` is checked, and if true, the code sets the pin to low and changes the state. However, this check is not atomic with the state change, and another thread or interrupt could potentially change the state before the check is completed, leading to unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: 
The issue here is that the check `delta < CEC_TIM_DATA_BIT_TOTAL_MIN` is not protected from concurrent access. If another thread or interrupt were to change the state of the pin while this check is being performed, it could lead to unexpected behavior. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a lock or other synchronization mechanism to protect the critical section of code that changes the state of the pin. This could be as simple as adding a mutex lock around the code that changes the state, or using a more sophisticated synchronization mechanism such as a semaphore. The exact solution will depend on the specific requirements of the system and the constraints of the hardware. However, the key
