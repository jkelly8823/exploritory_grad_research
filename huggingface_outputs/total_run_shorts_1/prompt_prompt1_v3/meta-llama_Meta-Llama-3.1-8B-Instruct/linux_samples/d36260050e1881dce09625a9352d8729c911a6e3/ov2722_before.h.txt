VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to a lack of bounds checking on the ov2722_res_preview array.
EXPLANATION: The ov2722_res_preview array is declared with a fixed size, but the code does not check if the index passed to the array is within the bounds of the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if an index greater than the size of the array is used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the index passed to the array is within the bounds of the array. This can be done by checking if the index is less than the size of the array before accessing it. For example: if (index < sizeof(ov2722_res_preview) / sizeof(ov2722_res_preview[0])) {... }. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a vector or a dynamically allocated array to avoid buffer overflows.  ```c
if (index < sizeof(ov2722_res_preview) / sizeof(ov2722_res_preview[0])) {
    ov2722_res_preview[index].desc = "new description";
}
``` ```c
ov2722_res_preview = realloc(ov
