VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `build_request` does not check if the `buf` and `end` pointers are valid before dereferencing them, which can lead to a null pointer dereference or buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `build_request` function takes two pointers `buf` and `end` as arguments, but it does not check if these pointers are valid before using them. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if either of the pointers is null, or a buffer overflow if the `buf` pointer points to a buffer that is too small to hold the data being written to it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `build_request` function should check if the `buf` and `end` pointers are valid before using them. This can be done by adding a simple null check and a check to ensure that the `buf` pointer points to a valid buffer. For example: `if (buf == NULL || end == NULL || buf > end) { return -EINVAL; }`. Additionally, the function should also check the size of the buffer to prevent buffer overflows. For example: `if (end
