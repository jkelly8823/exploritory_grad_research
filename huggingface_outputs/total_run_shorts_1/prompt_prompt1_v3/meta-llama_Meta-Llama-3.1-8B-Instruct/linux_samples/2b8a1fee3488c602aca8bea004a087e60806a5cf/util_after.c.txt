VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to A-MSDU aggregation injection attacks due to the lack of proper validation of the destination MAC address.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the destination MAC address is equal to the RFC 1042 header, but it does not check if the MAC address is valid or if it is a legitimate destination. This allows an attacker to inject malicious frames by spoofing the destination MAC address.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the destination MAC address. This can be done by checking if the MAC address is a valid multicast or broadcast address, or by checking if it is a legitimate destination MAC address. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the destination MAC address is not equal to the RFC 1042 header, but is still a valid destination MAC address. This can be done by adding additional checks to verify the destination MAC address.
