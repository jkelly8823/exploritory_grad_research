VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the `vmcs_write64` function without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `vmcs_write64` function is used to write a 64-bit value to a specific location in the VMCS. However, the value being written is not validated or checked for bounds, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value is larger than the expected size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the value being written to ensure it does not exceed the expected size. This can be done by adding a check before calling `vmcs_write64` to ensure the value is within the valid range. Additionally, consider using a safer function that performs bounds checking, such as `vmcs_write64_checked`. If such a function does not exist, consider implementing one to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  ```c
if (value > MAX_VMCS_VALUE) {
    // Handle error or throw exception
}
vmcs_write64(value, address);
