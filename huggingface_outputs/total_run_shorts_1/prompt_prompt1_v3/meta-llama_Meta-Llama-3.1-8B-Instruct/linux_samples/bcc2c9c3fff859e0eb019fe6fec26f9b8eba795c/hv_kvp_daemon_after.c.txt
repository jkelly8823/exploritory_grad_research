VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of a busy-waiting loop with a timeout of -1. This allows an attacker to cause the system to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The poll function is used with a timeout of -1, which means the function will block indefinitely until an event occurs. This can cause the system to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. The use of a busy-waiting loop with a timeout of -1 is a common technique used by attackers to cause a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the timeout value should be set to a reasonable value, such as 1000 or 5000, to prevent the system from consuming excessive CPU resources. Additionally, the use of a busy-waiting loop should be avoided in favor of a more efficient approach, such as using a select or epoll function with a timeout. The code should also be modified to handle the case where the poll function returns an error, rather than blocking indefinitely.
