VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a busy-wait loop with a timeout of -1. This allows an attacker to cause the system to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The busy-wait loop is used to wait for incoming data on the socket. However, the timeout of -1 means that the loop will continue indefinitely, allowing an attacker to send a large amount of data and cause the system to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to a denial-of-service, as the system will become unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the timeout should be set to a reasonable value, such as 1 second, to prevent the busy-wait loop from consuming excessive CPU resources. Additionally, the use of a busy-wait loop should be avoided in favor of a more efficient approach, such as using the select or epoll functions. The code should also be modified to handle the case where the recv function returns an error, such as EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK, to prevent the system from becoming unresponsive. Finally,
