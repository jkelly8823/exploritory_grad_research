VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the `scm->fp->count` variable in the for loop.
EXPLANATION: The for loop iterates over the `scm->fp->count` elements of the `scm->fp->fp` array, but it does not check if the index `i` is within the valid range of the array. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access if `scm->fp->count` is greater than the actual size of the array, resulting in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that the index `i` is within the valid range of the array. This can be done by adding a condition to check if `i >= 0` and `i < scm->fp->count` before accessing the array. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a linked list, to avoid the risk of buffer overflows.  ```c
for (i = scm->fp->count - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
	if (
