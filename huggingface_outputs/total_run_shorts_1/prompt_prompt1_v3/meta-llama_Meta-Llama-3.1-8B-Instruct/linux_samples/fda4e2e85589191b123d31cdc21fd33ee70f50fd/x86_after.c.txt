VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect handling of srcu_read_unlock.
EXPLANATION: The srcu_read_unlock function is called with a srcu_idx that may have been freed. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the srcu_idx is used after the srcu_read_unlock call.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Ensure that the srcu_idx is not used after the srcu_read_unlock call. This can be achieved by moving the srcu_read_unlock call to before the use of the srcu_idx. Alternatively, the srcu_idx can be stored in a local variable and used after the srcu_read_unlock call. However, this approach is not recommended as it can lead to deadlocks. The recommended approach is to move the srcu_read_unlock call to before the use of the srcu_idx.
