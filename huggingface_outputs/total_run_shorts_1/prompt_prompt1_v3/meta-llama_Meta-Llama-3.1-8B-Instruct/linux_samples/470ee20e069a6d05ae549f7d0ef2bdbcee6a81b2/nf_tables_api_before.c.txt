VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in this code. The function nft_set_lookup_byid() returns a pointer to a struct nft_set, but this pointer is not guaranteed to be valid after the function returns. This is because the function nft_trans_set() is called within the function, and this function may return a pointer to a struct nft_set that has already been freed.
EXPLANATION: The function nft_set_lookup_byid() is designed to look up a set by its ID. However, within this function, the function nft_trans_set() is called. This function returns a pointer to a struct nft_set, which is then used within the function. However, the function nft_trans_set() may return a pointer to a struct nft_set that has already been freed. This is because the function nft_trans_set() may be called multiple times within the function, and each time it is called, it may return a pointer to a struct nft_set that has already been freed. This creates a potential use-after-free vulnerability, as the function nft_set_lookup_byid() is returning a pointer to a struct
