VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Rogue Data Cache Load (RDC) attack. This is because the code does not properly handle the NO_MELTDOWN flag, which is used to indicate that the CPU is not vulnerable to the Meltdown attack. However, the code does not check if the CPU is vulnerable to the RDC attack, which can be exploited even if the CPU is not vulnerable to Meltdown.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the cpu_matches function to check if the CPU is vulnerable to certain bugs. However, the cpu_matches function only checks for the NO_MELTDOWN flag, but not for the NO_MDS flag, which is used to indicate that the CPU is not vulnerable to the RDC attack. This means that the code will not properly handle the NO_MDS flag, and will not prevent the RDC attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check for the NO_MDS flag in the cpu_matches function. This can be done by adding a check for the NO_MDS flag in the cpu_matches function, and returning false if the flag is not set. Additionally,
