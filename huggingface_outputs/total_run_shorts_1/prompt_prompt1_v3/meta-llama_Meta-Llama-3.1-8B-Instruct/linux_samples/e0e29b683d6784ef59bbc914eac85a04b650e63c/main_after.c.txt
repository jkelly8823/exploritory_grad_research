VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple loop that iterates over an array of error messages and prints them if they are not empty. The loop is followed by a call to a function to print firmware help text and a goto statement to exit the function. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix any vulnerabilities.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger program and may have other security issues that are not apparent from this snippet alone.  A thorough review of the entire program is recommended.  Additionally, the use of goto statements can make the code harder to understand and debug, and may be a code smell.  Consider refactoring the code to avoid the use of goto statements.  However, this is not a security vulnerability and is more of a code quality issue.  It is worth noting that the variable "i" is not declared in this snippet, but this
