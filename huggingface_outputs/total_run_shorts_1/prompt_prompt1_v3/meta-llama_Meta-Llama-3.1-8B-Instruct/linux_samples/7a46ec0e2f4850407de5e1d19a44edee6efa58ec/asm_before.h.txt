VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of an assembly language header file, and it defines macros for handling exceptions and kprobes. However, there is a potential issue with the macro redefinition.
EXPLANATION: 
The macro _ASM_EXTABLE_EX is redefined in the same file, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential bugs. This is because the macro is redefined with a different implementation, which may not be compatible with the previous definition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Remove the duplicate macro definition to avoid potential conflicts.
2. If the intention is to provide an alternative implementation, consider using a different macro name to avoid confusion.
3. Review the code to ensure that the macro is used consistently throughout the file.  ```bash
