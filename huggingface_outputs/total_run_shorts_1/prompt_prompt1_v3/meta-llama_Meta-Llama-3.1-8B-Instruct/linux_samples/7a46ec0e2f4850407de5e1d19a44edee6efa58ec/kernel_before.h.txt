VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a set of function declarations for a kernel module. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet consists of function declarations for a kernel module. The functions declared are do_exit, complete_and_exit, _kstrtoul, and _kstrtol. The functions are declared with the __noreturn attribute, indicating that they do not return. The functions also have the __must_check attribute, which indicates that the function will return an error if it fails. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and secure. Additionally, the use of the __must_check attribute is a good practice to ensure that errors are properly handled.  Please note that this code is likely part of a larger kernel module, and the security of the module depends on the overall design and implementation.  It is always a
