 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system that manages kernel-level data structures. The variables declared here are likely used to track various kernel-level metrics. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues. The use of #ifdef directives suggests that the code is designed to be configurable and modular, which is a good practice in terms of security.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is properly tested and validated before deployment. Additionally, the use of #ifdef directives should be carefully managed to avoid introducing complexity or security issues in the code.  ```bash
