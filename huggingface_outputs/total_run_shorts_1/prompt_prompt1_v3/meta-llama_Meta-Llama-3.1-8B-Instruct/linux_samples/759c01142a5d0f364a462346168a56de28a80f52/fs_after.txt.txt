VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The system is vulnerable to a hardlink-based time-of-check-time-of-use race.
EXPLANATION: The system is vulnerable to a hardlink-based time-of-check-time-of-use race because the protected_hardlinks setting is not enabled. This setting prevents the creation of hardlinks to world-writable directories, which can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Enable the protected_hardlinks setting to prevent the creation of hardlinks to world-writable directories. This can be done by setting the protected_hardlinks setting to 1. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures to prevent time-of-check-time-of-use races, such as using atomic operations or locking mechanisms.  ```bash
