VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The function kvm_arch_set_irq_inatomic() is called without acquiring the lock on the kvm->irqfds.lock. This can lead to a situation where the shutdown of the irqfd is attempted while the lock is still held by another thread, resulting in a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The function kvm_arch_set_irq_inatomic() is called without acquiring the lock on the kvm->irqfds.lock. This can lead to a situation where the shutdown of the irqfd is attempted while the lock is still held by another thread, resulting in a race condition. The function irqfd_inject() also does not acquire the lock before calling queue_work(). This can lead to a situation where the shutdown of the irqfd is attempted while the lock is still held by another thread, resulting in a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lock on the kvm->irqfds.lock should be acquired
