VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is set to point to `vmx->vmcs01` before the `vmx->vmcs01` struct is fully initialized. This can lead to a use-after-free bug when the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is used later in the code.
EXPLANATION: The `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is set to point to `vmx->vmcs01` before the `vmx->vmcs01` struct is fully initialized. This is problematic because the `vmx->vmcs01` struct is not yet fully initialized when the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is set. This can lead to a use-after-free bug when the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer is used later in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the `vmx->loaded_vmcs` pointer should be set to point to `vmx->vmcs01` after the `vmx->vmcs01` struct is fully initialized. This can be done by moving
