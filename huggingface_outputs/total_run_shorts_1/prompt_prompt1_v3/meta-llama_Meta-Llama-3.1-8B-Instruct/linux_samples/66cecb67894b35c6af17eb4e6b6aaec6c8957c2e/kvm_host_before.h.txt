VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the info parameter in the check_intercept function.
EXPLANATION: The check_intercept function takes a pointer to a struct x86_instruction_info as a parameter. However, there is no bounds checking on this parameter, which means that an attacker could potentially pass a pointer to a buffer that is too small, causing a buffer overflow. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the info parameter to ensure that it points to a valid buffer. This can be done by checking the size of the buffer and ensuring that it is large enough to hold the data being accessed. Additionally, consider using a safer function to access the buffer, such as memcpy or strncpy, to prevent buffer overflows.  The function signature should be modified to include a size parameter, such as: int check_intercept(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct x86_instruction_info *info, size_t size).  This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability.  The function should also be modified to check the size of the info parameter before accessing it,
