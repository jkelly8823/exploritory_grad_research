VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a low-level system programming project, specifically dealing with exception handling and system calls. The code defines two exception handlers: one for system call interrupts and another for auxiliary processor unavailable interrupts. The handlers are properly defined with the required parameters and function calls.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is well-structured and follows a clear pattern for defining exception handlers. The use of macros and function calls is consistent with low-level system programming practices. The exception handlers are properly defined with the required parameters, and the function calls are correct. There are no obvious vulnerabilities or security issues in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and well-written. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, consider using more descriptive variable names and comments to improve code readability.  ```
