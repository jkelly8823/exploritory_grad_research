VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `prom_printf` function.
EXPLANATION: 
The `prom_printf` function is called with a format string that includes a `%x` format specifier, which expects an integer argument. However, the `addr` variable is passed as an argument, which
