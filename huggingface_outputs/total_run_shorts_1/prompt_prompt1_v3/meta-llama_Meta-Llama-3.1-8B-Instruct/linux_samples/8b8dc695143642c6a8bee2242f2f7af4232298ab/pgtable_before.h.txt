VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference. The function pmd_access_permitted() is called with a null pointer pmd when radix_enabled() is false.
EXPLANATION: The function pmd_access_permitted() is called with a null pointer pmd when radix_enabled() is false. This is because the function radix__pmd_bad() returns an integer value, not a pointer to a pmd_t. The function pmd_access_permitted() expects a pointer to a pmd_t as its first argument. If radix_enabled() is false, the function pmd_access_permitted() will be called with a null pointer, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function pmd_access_permitted() should be called with a valid pointer to a pmd_t. This can be achieved by returning a pointer to a pmd_t from the function radix__pmd_bad() when radix_enabled() is false. Alternatively, the function pmd_access_permitted() can be modified to handle null pointers. However, this would require a more significant change to the code. The recommended fix is to return a pointer to
