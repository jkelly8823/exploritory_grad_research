VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential race condition exists due to the use of READ_ONCE() macro, which may not guarantee the latest value of pmd.
EXPLANATION: The READ_ONCE() macro is used to read the value of pmd, but it does not guarantee that the latest value of pmd is read. This is because pmd is a pointer to a page directory entry, and the value of pmd can change between the time the value is read and the time it is used. This can lead to a race condition, where the value of pmd is read before it is updated, resulting in an incorrect value being used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a spinlock or a mutex, to ensure that the value of pmd is read and used in a thread-safe manner. Alternatively, consider using a more modern synchronization primitive, such as an atomic read, to ensure that the value of pmd is read and used in a thread-safe manner. Additionally, consider using a lock to protect the pmd variable, to prevent other threads from modifying it while it is being read.
