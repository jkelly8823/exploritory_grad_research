VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The reboot_code_buffer variable is being incremented by KEXEC_CONTROL_PAGE_SIZE without checking if it has exceeded the size of the relocate_new_kernel array. This could potentially allow an attacker to write past the end of the array and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code is incrementing the reboot_code_buffer variable by KEXEC_CONTROL_PAGE_SIZE without checking if it has exceeded the size of the relocate_new_kernel array. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability. The reboot_code_buffer variable is being used as a pointer to the relocate_new_kernel array, and the increment operation is effectively writing past the end of the array. This could potentially allow an attacker to write arbitrary code to the memory location pointed to by reboot_code_buffer, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the reboot_code_buffer variable has exceeded the size of the relocate_new_kernel array before incrementing it. This can be done by adding a simple bounds check, such as if (reboot_code_buffer + KEXEC_CONTROL_PAGE_SIZE <= relocate_new_kernel_size). Additionally, the
