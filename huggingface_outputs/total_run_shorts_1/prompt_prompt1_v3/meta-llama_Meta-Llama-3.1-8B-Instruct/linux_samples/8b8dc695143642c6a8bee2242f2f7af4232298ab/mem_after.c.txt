VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a memory management system, specifically for setting up the maximum physical frame numbers for different memory zones.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a memory management system, specifically for setting up the maximum physical frame numbers for different memory zones. It checks for different configurations (CONFIG_ZONE_DMA, CONFIG_HIGHMEM) and sets the maximum zone physical frame numbers accordingly. The code uses bit shifting and masking to calculate the maximum zone physical frame numbers.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are provided as the code appears to be a standard implementation of memory zone setup. However, it is recommended to review the code in the context of the entire memory management system to ensure it aligns with the overall design and requirements. Additionally, consider using more descriptive variable names and comments to improve code readability.  Please let me know if you need anything else.
