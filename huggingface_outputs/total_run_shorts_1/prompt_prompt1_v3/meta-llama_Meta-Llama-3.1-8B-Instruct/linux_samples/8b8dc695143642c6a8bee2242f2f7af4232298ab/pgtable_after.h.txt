VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition in the pmd_access_permitted function. The function checks if the pmd is serializing, but it does not account for the possibility that the pmd may be serialized after the check is made but before the pte_access_permitted function is called.
EXPLANATION: The pmd_is_serializing function checks if the pmd is undergoing a split, which sets the _PAGE_PRESENT bit to clear and the _PAGE_INVALID bit to set. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent a race condition. If the pmd is serialized after the check is made but before the pte_access_permitted function is called, the pmd_access_permitted function will return true, even though the pmd is actually serialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a lock to ensure that the pmd is not serialized after the check is made but before the pte_access_permitted function is called. One possible solution is to use a spinlock to lock the pmd while the pte_access_permitted function is called. This will prevent the pmd from being serialized while the
