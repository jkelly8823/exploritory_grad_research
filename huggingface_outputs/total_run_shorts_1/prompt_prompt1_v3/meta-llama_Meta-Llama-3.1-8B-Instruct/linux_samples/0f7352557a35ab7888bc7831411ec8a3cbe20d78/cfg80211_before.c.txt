VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential null pointer dereference vulnerability when cfg is null.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not check if cfg is null before dereferencing it. If cfg is null, then the code will attempt to access memory at address 0, which is undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Check if cfg is null before dereferencing it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the first line of code. For example: if (cfg!= NULL) {... } else {... }.
