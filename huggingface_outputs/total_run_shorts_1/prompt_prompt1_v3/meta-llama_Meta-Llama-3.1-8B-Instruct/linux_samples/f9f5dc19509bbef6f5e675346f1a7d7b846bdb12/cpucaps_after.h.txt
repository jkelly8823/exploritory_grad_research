VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for ARM64 architecture capabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet defines a series of macro constants for ARM64 architecture capabilities. These constants are used to represent specific features or capabilities of the ARM64 architecture. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The macro definitions are straightforward and do not appear to be susceptible to any common vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it appears to be a clean and well-defined set of macro constants. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements and is free from any potential issues. Additionally, consider using a consistent naming convention and commenting the code to improve readability and maintainability.  ```bash
