 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `qcom_link_stack_sanitization` function. The `asm volatile` block uses a loop that can potentially overflow the stack if the number of iterations is too large.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet also contains a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability in the `qcom_enable_link_stack_sanitization` function. The `install_bp_hardening_cb` function is called with a null pointer as the `smccc_start` argument.
