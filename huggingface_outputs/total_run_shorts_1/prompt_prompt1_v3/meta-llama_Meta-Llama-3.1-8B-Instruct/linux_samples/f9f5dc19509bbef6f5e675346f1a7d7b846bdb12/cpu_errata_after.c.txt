VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the qcom_link_stack_sanitization function. The function uses an inline assembly instruction to move a value into the x30 register, but it does not properly check the size of the buffer being accessed.
EXPLANATION: The qcom_link_stack_sanitization function uses an inline assembly instruction to move a value into the x30 register. However, the instruction does not properly check the size of the buffer being accessed, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not large enough to hold the value being moved into it. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the qcom_link_stack_sanitization function should be modified to properly check the size of the buffer being accessed before moving a value into it. This could be done by adding a check to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the value being moved into it, or by using a safer method to access the buffer. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly handling any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the inline assembly instruction.
