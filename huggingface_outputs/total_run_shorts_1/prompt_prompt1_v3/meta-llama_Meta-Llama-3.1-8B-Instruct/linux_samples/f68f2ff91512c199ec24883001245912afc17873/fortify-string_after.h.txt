VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `strcpy` function. The `strlen` function is called on the `q` string, but the result is not checked for overflow before being used to calculate the size of the copy operation.
EXPLANATION: The `strcpy` function uses the `strlen` function to calculate the size of the copy operation. However, if the `strlen` function returns a value that is larger than the buffer size `p_size`, the `fortify_panic` function will be called, but the buffer will still be overflowed. This is because the `strlen` function is called before the buffer size check, and the result is not checked for overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `strlen` function should be called after the buffer size check, and the result should be checked for overflow before being used to calculate the size of the copy operation. This can be done by adding a check for `p_size < strlen(q) + 1` before calling `__underlying_memcpy`. Additionally, the `fortify_panic` function should be called if the buffer size is too
