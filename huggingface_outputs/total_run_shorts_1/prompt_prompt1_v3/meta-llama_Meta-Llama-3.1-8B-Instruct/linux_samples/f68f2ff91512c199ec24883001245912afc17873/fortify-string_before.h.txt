VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a vulnerability in the memcpy function. The function does not properly check for buffer overflow when the size is not a constant. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the size is larger than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function checks if the size is a constant, and if so, it calls the __write_overflow function if the buffer size is less than the size. However, if the size is not a constant, it only checks if the buffer size is less than the size, but it does not check if the size is larger than the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the size is larger than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the memcpy function should be modified to check if the size is larger than the buffer size when the size is not a constant. This can be done by adding a check for size > p_size in the if statement. The corrected code should look like this: if (p_size < size || size > p_size) fortify_panic(__func__);. Additionally, the __write_overflow function should be called when the size is larger than the
