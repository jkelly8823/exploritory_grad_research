VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of min_t with an unsigned int and a potentially large value from the network.
EXPLANATION: The min_t function is used to ensure that the maxBuf value does not exceed SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE. However, the value from the network (le32_to_cpu(rsp->MaxTransactSize)) is a 32-bit unsigned integer, which can potentially be very large. If this value is larger than SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, the min_t function will not prevent a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer function like clamp_t to limit the value to a safe range, or validate the value from the network to ensure it is within a safe range before passing it to min_t. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to handle the maxBuf value, such as using a fixed-size buffer or a dynamically allocated buffer with proper bounds checking.  Also, the code should validate the SecurityMode value to prevent potential security issues.  The comment "BB Do we need to validate the SecurityMode?" suggests that this is a known issue, but it has not been
