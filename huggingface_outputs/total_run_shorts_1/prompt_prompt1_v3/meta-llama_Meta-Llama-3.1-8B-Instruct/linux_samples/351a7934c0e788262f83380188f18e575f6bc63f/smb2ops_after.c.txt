VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3, 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflow attacks. The `min_t` function is used to limit the value of `wsize` and `rsize` to prevent buffer overflows, but it does not prevent integer overflows. If an attacker can control the value of `volume_info->wsize` or `volume_info->rsize`, they can cause the `min_t` function to return a value that is larger than `SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `min_t` function is used to limit the value of `wsize` and `rsize` to prevent buffer overflows. However, it does not prevent integer overflows. If the value of `volume_info->wsize` or `volume_info->rsize` is larger than `SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, the `min_t` function will return a value that is larger than `SMB2_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, leading to a buffer overflow. This is a classic example of a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow.
