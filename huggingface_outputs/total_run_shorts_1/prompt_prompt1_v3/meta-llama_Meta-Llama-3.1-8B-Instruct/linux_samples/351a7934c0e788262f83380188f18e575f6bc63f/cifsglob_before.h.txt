VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A function pointer is being assigned a value that is not checked for null before being dereferenced.
EXPLANATION: The function pointer `get_acl` is being assigned a value without any null check. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the assigned value is null. This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Before assigning a value to the function pointer, check if the value is null. If it is null, handle it accordingly. For example, you can return an error or log a message. Here is an example of how to do it: `if (get_acl!= NULL) { /* assign value to get_acl */ } else { /* handle null value */ }`  Also, consider using a safer way to assign function pointers, such as using a function pointer that returns a pointer to a function, or using a safer function pointer type.  Additionally, consider using a code analysis tool to detect similar vulnerabilities in the codebase.  Finally, consider implementing a null pointer dereference protection mechanism, such as a guard clause, to prevent null pointer dereferences.  This can be done by
