VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function cifs_get_inode_info has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of input validation on the full_path parameter.
EXPLANATION: The function cifs_get_inode_info takes a const char *full_path parameter, which is not validated for length or content. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer used to store the full_path parameter, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should validate the length and content of the full_path parameter before using it. This can be done by checking the length of the full_path string and ensuring it does not exceed a certain limit. Additionally, the function should check the content of the full_path string for any malicious characters or patterns. The function should also consider using a safer function to copy the full_path string, such as strlcpy or strncpy, to prevent buffer overflows. Finally, the function should consider using a whitelist approach to validate the full_path parameter, where only a specific set of allowed characters and patterns are accepted.  The function should also consider using a safer function to copy the full_path string, such as strlcpy or strncpy
