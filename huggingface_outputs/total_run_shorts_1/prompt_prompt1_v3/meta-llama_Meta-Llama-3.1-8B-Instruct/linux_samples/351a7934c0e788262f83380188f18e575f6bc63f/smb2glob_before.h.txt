 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file that defines two constants, SMB2_CMACAES_SIZE and SMB3_SIGNKEY_SIZE. The values of these constants are defined as 16. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a simple and secure definition of constants.  The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security issues.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that the values of these constants are correct and not vulnerable to any potential attacks.  Additionally, it is recommended to consider using a more secure method to define these constants, such as using a secure random number generator to generate the values.  But in this case, the values are hardcoded and do not pose any immediate security risks.  It is also worth noting that this code snippet is a header file, and the actual implementation of the constants is likely to be in a separate source file.  Therefore, the security of this code snippet is dependent on the security
