VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of shared pointers and the lack of synchronization between threads.
EXPLANATION: The code uses shared pointers to store and retrieve ACLs, which can lead to a race condition when multiple threads access the same ACL simultaneously. The lack of synchronization between threads can cause the ACL to be overwritten or corrupted, leading to incorrect results or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use thread-safe pointers or synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes or locks, to ensure that only one thread can access and modify the ACL at a time. Additionally, the code should check for and handle errors when retrieving and parsing the ACL to prevent crashes and incorrect results. The code should also consider using a more robust data structure, such as a lock-free queue, to store and retrieve ACLs. 

Note: The lines mentioned in VULNERABLE_LINES are the lines where the shared pointers are used.
