VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The function get_cifs_acl_by_fid() returns a pointer to a struct cifs_ntsd, which is allocated in the function CIFSSMBGetCIFSACL(). However, the function free_xid() is called before the pointer is returned, which means that the memory allocated for the struct cifs_ntsd is freed before it is used. This can cause a use-after-free bug when the returned pointer is used.
EXPLANATION: The function get_cifs_acl_by_fid() calls the function CIFSSMBGetCIFSACL(), which allocates memory for the struct cifs_ntsd. However, the function free_xid() is called before the pointer to the struct cifs_ntsd is returned. This means that the memory allocated for the struct cifs_ntsd is freed before it is used, which can cause a use-after-free bug.
