VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function cifs_get_inode_info has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the variable tmprc which is assigned the value ENOSYS (2147483647) without any bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The variable tmprc is assigned the value ENOSYS which is a large integer value. If this value is not properly checked for bounds, it could potentially cause a buffer overflow when used in subsequent operations. This is a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the value of tmprc for bounds before using it in subsequent operations. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if tmprc is within a valid range. For example: if (tmprc >= 0 && tmprc <= INT_MAX) {... } else {... } This will prevent the potential buffer overflow and ensure the code is secure. Additionally, it's recommended to use a safer value for tmprc, such as 0, to avoid any potential issues.  Also, the use of ENOSYS should be reviewed and replaced with a more appropriate
