VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of a hardcoded port number (0) in the server.listen() method. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker can guess the assigned port number.
EXPLANATION: The server.listen() method is used to start the server and listen for incoming connections. The first argument is the port number on which the server will listen. In this case, the port number is hardcoded to 0, which means the operating system will assign an available port number. However, this can lead to a DoS attack if an attacker can guess the assigned port number and flood the server with connections.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a non-hardcoded port number, such as a random port number or a port number that is not easily guessable. For example, you can use a port number in the range of 49152 to 65535, which is reserved for private use. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting and other security measures to prevent DoS attacks. ```javascript
server.listen(Math.floor(Math.random() * (65535 - 49152 + 1))
