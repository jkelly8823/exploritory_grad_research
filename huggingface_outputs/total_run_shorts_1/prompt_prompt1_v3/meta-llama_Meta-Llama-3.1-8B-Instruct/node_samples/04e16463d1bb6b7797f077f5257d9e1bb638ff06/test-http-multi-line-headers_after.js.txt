VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `insecureHTTPParser` option. This option allows the server to parse HTTP requests without validating the request headers, which can lead to a denial of service attack.
EXPLANATION: The `insecureHTTPParser` option is a known vulnerability in Node.js that allows an attacker to send a malicious HTTP request with a large request body, causing the server to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a denial of service. This vulnerability is particularly concerning when the server is listening on a port that is accessible from the internet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `insecureHTTPParser` option should be removed or set to `false`. Additionally, the server should be configured to handle large request bodies properly, such as by setting a reasonable limit on the request body size. This can be done by using the `http.maxHeaderSize` and `http.maxRequestSize` options. For example: `server.listen(0, common.mustCall(function() {... })); server.http.maxHeaderSize = 1024; server.http.maxRequest
