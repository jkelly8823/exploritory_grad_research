VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `http.get` method with a hardcoded IP address and port. An attacker could potentially flood the server with requests, causing it to become unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The `http.get` method is used to send an HTTP GET request to the server, but it does not include any error handling or rate limiting. This makes it vulnerable to a DoS attack, where an attacker could send a large number of requests to the server, causing it to become unresponsive. Additionally, the use of a hardcoded IP address and port makes it easier for an attacker to target the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust request handling mechanism, such as a load balancer or a request queue. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting and error handling to prevent DoS attacks. It would also be beneficial to use environment variables or a configuration file to store the IP address and port, rather than hardcoding them.  The use of `common.mustCall` is also a potential issue as it can lead to a situation where the
