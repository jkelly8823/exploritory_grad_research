VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be setting properties on an object and setting the prototype of the Server class. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure.  The use of ObjectSetPrototypeOf is a valid way to set the prototype of a class in JavaScript.  The properties being set on the object appear to be valid and do not pose any security risks.  However, it is worth noting that the use of null for the maxHeadersCount property may be a design decision and may not be a vulnerability in and of itself.  It is worth considering whether this property should be set to a specific value or whether it should be removed altogether.  However, this is not a security vulnerability.
