VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability due to lack of timeout protection.
EXPLANATION: The server.requestTimeout value is set to 0 by default, which means there is no limit on the time it takes to receive the entire request from the client. This can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack if the server is deployed without a reverse proxy in front.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Set server.requestTimeout to a non-zero value (e.g. 120 seconds) to protect against potential Denial-of-Service attacks. Additionally, consider implementing a reverse proxy in front of the server to add an extra layer of protection.  Also, consider implementing a callback function to handle the timeout event.  This will allow the server to respond with a status 408 and close the connection without forwarding the request to the request listener.  This will prevent the server from being overwhelmed by requests and reduce the risk of a DoS attack.  The callback function can be used to log the event, send a response to the client, or take other necessary actions.  The callback function should be set to a non-null value to
