VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation for the 'headers' array. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker were to provide a large number of headers, causing the parser to consume excessive resources.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable because it does not check the length of the 'headers' array before iterating over it. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker were to provide a large number of headers, causing the parser to consume excessive resources. The 'parser.maxHeaderPairs' check is not sufficient to prevent this vulnerability, as it only checks if the maximum number of header pairs is greater than 0, but does not prevent the parser from consuming excessive resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include input validation for the 'headers' array. This could be achieved by checking the length of the array before iterating over it, and throwing an error if the length exceeds a certain threshold. Additionally, the 'parser.maxHeaderPairs' check should be modified to prevent the parser from consuming excessive resources. This could
