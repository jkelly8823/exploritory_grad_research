  return server;
}
```


VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of `socket.setTimeout(1000)`. This method sets the timeout for the socket, but it does not prevent the socket from being reused after the timeout has expired. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker is able to repeatedly create and close sockets
