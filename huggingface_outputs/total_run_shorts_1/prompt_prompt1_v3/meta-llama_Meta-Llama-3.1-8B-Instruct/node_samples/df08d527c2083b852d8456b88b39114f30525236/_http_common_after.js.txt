VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of the 'debug' function without proper error handling. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker can manipulate the 'debug' function to consume excessive resources.
EXPLANATION: The 'debug' function is used to log messages, but it does not have proper error handling. If an attacker can manipulate the 'debug' function to consume excessive resources, it could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is a potential vulnerability because it could allow an attacker to crash the server or consume excessive resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper error handling to the 'debug' function. This could include checking for excessive resource consumption and limiting the amount of resources that the function can use. You should also consider using a more secure logging mechanism, such as a logging library that is designed to handle errors and exceptions properly. Additionally, you should ensure that the 'debug' function is not used in production code, as it is not designed for production use. Instead, use a more secure logging mechanism that is designed for production use.
