VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The req_wrap_obj is being used after it has been reset in the previous iteration of the function. This can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided appears to be part of a function that handles stream writes. It creates a shutdown wrap object and uses it to perform a shutdown operation. However, in the previous iteration of the function, the req_wrap_obj is reset using the StreamReq::ResetObject function. This means that the req_wrap_obj is no longer valid and should not be used again. Nevertheless, the code continues to use the req_wrap_obj, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the req_wrap_obj is not used after it has been reset. This can be achieved by removing the line StreamReq::ResetObject(req_wrap_obj); after the shutdown operation has been completed. Alternatively, a new req_wrap_obj can be created before the shutdown operation, and the old one can be reset after the operation has been completed. This will ensure that the
