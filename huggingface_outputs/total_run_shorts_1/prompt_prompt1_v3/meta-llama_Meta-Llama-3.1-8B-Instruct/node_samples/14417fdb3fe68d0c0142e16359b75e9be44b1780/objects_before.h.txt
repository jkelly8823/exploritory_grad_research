VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow when calculating the value of kArgumentsCountMask.
EXPLANATION: The line `static const int kArgumentsCountMask = ~((1 << kArgumentsCountShift) - 1);` is the source of the vulnerability. The expression `1 << kArgumentsCountShift` will result in a value that is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an int, causing an integer overflow when the bitwise NOT operator (~) is applied. This can lead to an incorrect value being assigned to kArgumentsCountMask.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a larger integer type, such as uint64_t, to represent the value of kArgumentsCountShift and kArgumentsCountMask. Alternatively, the code can use a bitwise shift operation that does not result in an integer overflow, such as using a smaller shift value or using a different data type that can represent the result of the shift operation. Additionally, the code should include checks to ensure that the result of the shift operation does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. ```c
