VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the `num_parameters` variable. An attacker could potentially cause the program to enter an infinite loop by manipulating the `num_parameters` value.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if `num_parameters` exceeds `Code::kMaxArguments` but does not validate the input before incrementing it. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `num_parameters` value, potentially causing the program to enter an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input before incrementing the `num_parameters` value. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that `num_parameters` is within a valid range before incrementing it. Additionally, consider using a more robust data structure, such as a linked list, to store the parameters to prevent memory exhaustion. ```c
if (num_parameters >= Code::kMaxArguments) {
  ReportMessageAt(scanner().location(), "too_many_parameters",
                  Vector<const char*>::empty());
  *ok = false;
  return NULL;
}
