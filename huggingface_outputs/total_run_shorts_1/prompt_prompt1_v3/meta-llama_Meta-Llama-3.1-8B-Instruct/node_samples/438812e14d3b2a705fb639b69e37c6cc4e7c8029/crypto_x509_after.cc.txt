VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. This occurs when the `cert` object is accessed after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The `cert` object is freed when the `ClearErrorOnReturn` object is destroyed. However, the `cert` object is still accessed in the subsequent lines of code. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `cert` object is not accessed after it has been freed. This can be achieved by moving the code that accesses the `cert` object before the `ClearErrorOnReturn` object is destroyed. Alternatively, a copy of the `cert` object can be made before it is freed, and the copy can be used instead.
