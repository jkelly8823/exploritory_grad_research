VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. This occurs when the cert object is accessed after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The use-after-free vulnerability is introduced when the cert object is accessed after it has been freed. This happens in the first and third blocks of code. In the first block, the cert object is freed when the ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP function returns, but it is still accessed in the line after. In the third block, the cert object is freed when the X509ToObject function returns, but it is still accessed in the line after.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the cert object should be accessed before it is freed. This can be achieved by moving the access to the cert object before the ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP function. For example, the first block of code can be modified as follows: X509Certificate* cert = args.Holder().As<X509Certificate>(); if (cert) { args.GetReturnValue().Set(X509_check_ca(cert->get()) == 1); } else { args.GetReturnValue().Set(Undefined()); } This modification ensures that the
