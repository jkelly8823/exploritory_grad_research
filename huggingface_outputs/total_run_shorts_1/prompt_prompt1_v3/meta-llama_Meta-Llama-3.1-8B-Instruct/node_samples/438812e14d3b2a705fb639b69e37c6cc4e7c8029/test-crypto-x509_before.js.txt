VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `crypto` module's `generateKeyPairSync` function without proper error handling. This function can throw an error if the key generation fails, which can lead to a crash of the application.
EXPLANATION: The `generateKeyPairSync` function is used to generate a key pair, but it does not handle errors properly. If the key generation fails, the function will throw an error, which can cause the application to crash. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle errors properly when using the `generateKeyPairSync` function. This can be done by wrapping the function call in a try-catch block and handling the error accordingly. For example: `try { const keyPair = generateKeyPairSync('ed25519'); } catch (err) { console.error(err); }`. Additionally, the code should be modified to check the return value of the `generateKeyPairSync` function to ensure that it
