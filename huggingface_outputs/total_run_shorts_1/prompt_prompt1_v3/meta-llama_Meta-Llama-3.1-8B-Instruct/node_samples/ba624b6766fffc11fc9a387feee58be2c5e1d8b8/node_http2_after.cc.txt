VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential race condition exists in the code. The flag SESSION_STATE_WRITE_IN_PROGRESS is being set and unset in a non-atomic manner, which could lead to a situation where the flag is set to true while a write is still in progress, but the write has not yet completed.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises in the lines where the flag is being set and unset. The flag is being set in the line `flags_ |= SESSION_STATE_WRITE_IN_PROGRESS;` and unset in the line `flags_ &= ~SESSION_STATE_WRITE_IN_PROGRESS;`. However, these operations are not atomic, which means that another thread could potentially set the flag to true while a write is still in progress, but the write has not yet completed. This could lead to a situation where the flag is set to true while a write is still in progress, but the write has not yet completed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the flag should be set and unset in an atomic manner. This can be achieved by using a lock or a mutex to ensure that only one thread can access the flag at a time. Alternatively, the flag could be replaced with a
