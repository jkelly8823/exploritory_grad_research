VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle IPv6 addresses. It incorrectly assumes that an IPv6 address will always be enclosed in square brackets, which is not the case for all IPv6 addresses.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the input string starts and ends with square brackets, but this is not a valid way to check for IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses can be written in several different formats, including the full 128-bit address, the shortened form, and the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. The code does not account for these different formats, which makes it vulnerable to incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle IPv6 addresses. This can be done by using a regular expression to match the different formats of IPv6 addresses. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a library that provides a robust way to parse IPv6 addresses. The code should also be modified to handle the case where the input string is an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address. This can be done by checking if the input string starts with "::ffff:" and then parsing the rest of the string as
