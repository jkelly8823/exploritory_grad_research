 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a non-routable IP address in the Host header.
EXPLANATION: The Host header in the request contains the IP address "0.0.0.0", which is a non-routable IP address. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker were to send a large number of requests with this IP address, causing the server to become overwhelmed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to validate and sanitize the Host header to prevent the use of non-routable IP addresses. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to check if the Host header matches a valid IP address or domain name. Additionally, the code should be designed to handle large volumes of requests and implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks.  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 |
