VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling attacks. This is because the code does not properly validate the Host header, allowing an attacker to manipulate the Host header to smuggle HTTP requests.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it does not check for invalid Host headers. The Host header is used to determine the destination IP address of an HTTP request. An attacker can manipulate the Host header to send a request to a different server, potentially allowing them to smuggle HTTP requests. This can be done by sending a request with a Host header that is longer than the original request, or by sending a request with a Host header that contains invalid characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the Host header. This can be done by checking that the Host header is not longer than the original request, and that it does not contain any invalid characters. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle cases where the Host header is missing or malformed. This can be done by sending a 400 Bad Request response to the client in these cases. The code should also be modified to properly handle cases where the Host header is an
