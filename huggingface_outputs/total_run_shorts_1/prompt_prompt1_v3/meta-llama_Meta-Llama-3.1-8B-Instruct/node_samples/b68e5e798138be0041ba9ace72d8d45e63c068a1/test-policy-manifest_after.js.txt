VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of spawnSync with a potentially untrusted input. This can lead to a resource exhaustion attack, where the attacker can cause the system to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The code uses spawnSync to execute a command with potentially untrusted input. This can lead to a resource exhaustion attack, where the attacker can cause the system to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service. The use of spawnSync with untrusted input is a common vulnerability in Node.js applications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a safer alternative to spawnSync, such as child_process.execSync or child_process.exec. These functions provide better security features, such as input validation and resource limiting, to prevent resource exhaustion attacks. Additionally, consider using a library like child_process-promise to simplify the use of child_process functions and improve security.
