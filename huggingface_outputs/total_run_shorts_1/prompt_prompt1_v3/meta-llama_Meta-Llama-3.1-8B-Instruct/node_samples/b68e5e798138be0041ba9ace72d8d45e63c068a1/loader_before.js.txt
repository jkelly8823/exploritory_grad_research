VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function internalRequire does not properly handle the case where the module is not found. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
EXPLANATION: The function internalRequire does not check if the module is found before proceeding. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if an attacker can provide a module that is not found. The function should check if the module is found and throw an error if it is not.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function internalRequire should be modified to check if the module is found before proceeding. This can be done by adding a check to see if the module is in the cache or if it can be resolved. If the module is not found, an error should be thrown. For example: if (!module ||!module.exports) { throw new Error(`Module not found: ${id}`); } 
```javascript
const relativeResolveCache = { __proto__: null };

let requireDepth = 0;
let statCache = null;
let isPreloading = false;

function internalRequire(module, id) {
  validateString(id, 'id');
  if (id ===
