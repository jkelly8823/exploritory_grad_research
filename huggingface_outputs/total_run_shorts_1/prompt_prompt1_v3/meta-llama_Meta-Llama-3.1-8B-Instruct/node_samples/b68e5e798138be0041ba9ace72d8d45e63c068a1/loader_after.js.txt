VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a prototype pollution vulnerability. This occurs when an attacker can manipulate the prototype of an object, potentially leading to unintended behavior or security issues.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is present in the line where the `constructor` property is being defined on the `Module.prototype` object. The `__proto__: null` syntax is used to create a new object that does not inherit from the `Module.prototype` object. However, this is not necessary in this case, as the `get` function is not being used to access the `Module` object. The `get` function is being used to return `undefined` if the `policy()` function returns `true`. This is a potential vulnerability because an attacker could manipulate the `Module.prototype` object to return a different value, potentially leading to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should remove the `__proto__: null` syntax and define the `constructor` property on the `Module.prototype` object without it. This will ensure that the `constructor` property is properly defined and cannot be manipulated by an attacker. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure approach to
