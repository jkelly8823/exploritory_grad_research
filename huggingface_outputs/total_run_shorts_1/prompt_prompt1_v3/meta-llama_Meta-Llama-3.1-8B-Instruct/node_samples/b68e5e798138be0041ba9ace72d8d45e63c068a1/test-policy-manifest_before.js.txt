VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a false positive assertion error. The `assert.match` function is used to check for specific error messages in the `stderr` output. However, the regular expressions used in the assertions are not robust and may match false positives, leading to incorrect assertion failures.
EXPLANATION: The `assert.match` function is used to check for specific error messages in the `stderr` output. However, the regular expressions used in the assertions are not robust and may match false positives, leading to incorrect assertion failures. This is because the regular expressions are too specific and may match other error messages that contain the same substrings. For example, the first assertion may match an error message that contains the string "ERR_MANIFEST_DEPENDENCY_MISSING" but also contains other characters that are not part of the expected error message. This can lead to false positive assertion failures, which can be difficult to debug.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expressions used in the assertions should be made more robust by using word boundaries or other techniques to ensure that the expected error messages are matched exactly. Additionally, the assertions should be tested thoroughly to ensure
