VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a lazy-loaded Module object. An attacker could exploit this by creating a cycle of dependencies, causing the lazyModule function to recursively load the Module object indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
EXPLANATION: The lazyModule function is used to load the Module object on demand. However, if an attacker can create a cycle of dependencies, the lazyModule function will recursively load the Module object indefinitely, causing a denial-of-service condition. This is because the lazyModule function uses the $Module variable to store the loaded Module object, and if the $Module variable is not set, it will recursively call itself to load the Module object.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lazyModule function should be modified to use a more robust approach to loading the Module object, such as using a promise or a callback to load the object asynchronously. Additionally, the code should be modified to prevent the creation of cycles of dependencies, such as by using a dependency graph to track the dependencies between modules. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the lazyModule
