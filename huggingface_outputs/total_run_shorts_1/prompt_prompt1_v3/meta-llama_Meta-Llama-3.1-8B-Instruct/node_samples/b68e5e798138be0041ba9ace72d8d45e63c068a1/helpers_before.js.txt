VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of the `require` function without proper validation, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or code execution.
EXPLANATION: The `require` function is used to load modules, but it does not perform any validation on the module's dependencies. If a malicious module is loaded, it can potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or code execution. This is because the `require` function does not check if the module's dependencies are valid or if they exist.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the module's dependencies before loading them. You can use the `Module.prototype.require` method, which performs validation on the module's dependencies. Alternatively, you can use a library like `require-optional` to load modules with optional dependencies. Additionally, you should consider using a module loader that performs validation on the module's dependencies, such as `module-alias`. 

Note: The vulnerability is identified on line 14, where the `require` function is called without any validation. 

Please let me know if this is correct.
