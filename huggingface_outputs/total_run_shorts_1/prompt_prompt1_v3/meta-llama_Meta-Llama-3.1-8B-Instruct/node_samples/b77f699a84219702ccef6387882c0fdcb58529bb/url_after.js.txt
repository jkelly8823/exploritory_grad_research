VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a potentially slow regular expression in the `hostPattern.test(rest)` method.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `hostPattern` is not provided in the code snippet, but it is likely a complex regular expression that can cause the function to take a long time to execute when given a malicious input. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more efficient regular expression or a library that provides a safer way to match URLs. Additionally, consider adding input validation to prevent malicious inputs from reaching the regular expression. If the `hostPattern` regular expression is necessary, consider using a caching mechanism to store the results of previous matches to prevent repeated evaluations.  Consider using a library like `url-regex` which is designed to be fast and safe.  Consider using a library like `regex-cache` to cache the results of the regular expression.  Consider using a library like `fast-regex` to replace the regular expression with a faster one.  Consider using a library like `
