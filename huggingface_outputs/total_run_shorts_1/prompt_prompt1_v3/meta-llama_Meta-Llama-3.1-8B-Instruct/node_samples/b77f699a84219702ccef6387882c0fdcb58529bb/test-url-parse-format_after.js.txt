 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a case-insensitive protocol verification issue. This allows for potential security exploits, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by allowing malicious URLs to be parsed and executed.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it does not properly handle case-insensitive protocol verification. The `url.parse()` function is used to parse URLs, but it does not account for the case of the protocol. This allows for a malicious URL with a protocol in a different case (e.g. "javAscript") to be parsed and executed, potentially leading to security exploits.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle case-insensitive protocol verification. This can be achieved by converting the protocol to lowercase before parsing the URL. For example, the `url.parse()` function can be modified to use `protocol.toLowerCase()` instead of `protocol` when parsing the URL. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all potential security exploits are accounted for.  The `url.resolveObject()` function should also be reviewed to ensure it is properly handling case-insensitive protocol verification.  It may be necessary to
