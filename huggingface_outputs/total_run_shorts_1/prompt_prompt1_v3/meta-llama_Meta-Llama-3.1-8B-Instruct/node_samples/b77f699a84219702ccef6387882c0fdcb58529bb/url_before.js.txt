VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `hostPattern.test(rest)` method. The regular expression is not anchored, which allows an attacker to manipulate the input to cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `hostPattern.test(rest)` is not anchored, which means it can match anywhere in the string `rest`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input to cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. The regular expression is also not optimized for performance, which can further exacerbate the issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be anchored to the start of the string using the `^` character. Additionally, the regular expression should be optimized for performance using techniques such as using character classes instead of repetitive patterns. For example, the regular expression could be rewritten as `^/[^/]+/[^/]+`. This will prevent an attacker from manipulating the input to cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources. ```javascript
