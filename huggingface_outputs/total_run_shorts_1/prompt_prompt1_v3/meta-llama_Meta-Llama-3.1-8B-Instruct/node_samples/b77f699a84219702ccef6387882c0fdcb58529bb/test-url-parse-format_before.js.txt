VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a DOM-based XSS attack due to the use of untrusted user input in the href attribute of the object.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the href attribute of an object to store a URL. However, the URL is not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code. This is a classic example of a DOM-based XSS attack. The attacker can manipulate the href attribute to inject malicious JavaScript code, which can then be executed by the browser.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the user input before storing it in the href attribute. This can be done by using a library like DOMPurify to remove any malicious code from the input. Additionally, the code should validate the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format. The href attribute should be set to a trusted value, such as a hardcoded URL, to prevent any potential attacks.
