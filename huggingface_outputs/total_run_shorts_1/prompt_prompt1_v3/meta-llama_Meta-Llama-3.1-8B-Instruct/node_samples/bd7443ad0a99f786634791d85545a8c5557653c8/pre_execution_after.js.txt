VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a permission bypass attack. The `process.binding` function is being overridden to throw an `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` error, but this can be bypassed by calling `process.binding` directly.
EXPLANATION: The `process.binding` function is being overridden to throw an `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` error when an experimental permission is enabled. However, this override is not secure because it can be bypassed by calling `process.binding` directly. This allows an attacker to access restricted functionality without being granted the necessary permission.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `process.binding` function should be removed from the override and instead, the `has` and `deny` functions from the `internal/process/permission` module should be used to check and deny access to restricted functionality. Additionally, the `process.emitWarning` call should be removed as it is not necessary and can be used to bypass the permission check. The code should be refactored to use a secure permission checking mechanism. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the line where the `process.binding` function is being overridden. The `11` in `V
