VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a default value for the `maxSettings` option without proper validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the default value is exceeded.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines an `options` object with a `maxSettings` property that has a default value of 32. However, the code does not validate whether the provided value exceeds the default value. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the default value is exceeded, as the code does not account for values greater than 32.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the provided value for `maxSettings` to ensure it does not exceed the default value. This can be achieved by adding a simple check before setting the value, such as `if (options.maxSettings > 32) { options.maxSettings = 32; }`. Additionally, consider using a more robust validation mechanism, such as a regular expression or a custom validation function, to ensure the value is within the expected range.  VULNERABLE: YES
