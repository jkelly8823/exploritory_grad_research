 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of an enumeration definition in C++. It defines several constants and an enumeration type. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are provided for this code snippet as it does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to follow standard coding conventions and ensure that the enumeration values are properly defined and used throughout the codebase.  ```python
def get_enum_value(enum_type, value):
    try:
        return enum_type(value)
    except ValueError:
        return None
```  This function can be used to safely retrieve an enumeration value by its name. It returns None if the value is not found in the enumeration.  ```python
enum_value = get_enum_value(Http2StreamStatisticsIndex, "IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_OUTSTANDING_PINGS")
if enum_value is not None:
    print(enum_value)
```  This code snippet demonstrates how to use the get_enum_value function to safely retrieve an enumeration value.  ```python
enum_value = get_enum_value(Http2StreamStatistics
