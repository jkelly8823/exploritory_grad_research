VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. The `updateOptionsBuffer` function is called with an object containing values that are assigned directly to the `optionsBuffer` array. However, the values are not validated or sanitized, which allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for one of the properties.
EXPLANATION: The `updateOptionsBuffer` function is called with an object containing values that are assigned directly to the `optionsBuffer` array. However, the values are not validated or sanitized, which allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for one of the properties. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, where an attacker can manipulate the input data to write arbitrary data to a buffer, potentially leading to code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `updateOptionsBuffer` function should be modified to validate and sanitize the input data before assigning it to the `optionsBuffer` array. This can be done by using a library like `lodash` to validate the input data and ensure that it conforms to the
