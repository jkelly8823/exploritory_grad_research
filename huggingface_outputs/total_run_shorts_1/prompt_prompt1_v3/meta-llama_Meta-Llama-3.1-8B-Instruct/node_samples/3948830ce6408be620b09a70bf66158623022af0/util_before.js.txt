VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the updateOptionsBuffer function.
EXPLANATION: The updateOptionsBuffer function does not properly handle the case where options.maxSessionMemory is a large number. The MathMax function is used to ensure that the value is at least 1, but it does not prevent the value from exceeding the maximum limit of the IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_SESSION_MEMORY constant. This could potentially lead to an integer overflow, causing the value to wrap around and produce an incorrect result.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the updateOptionsBuffer function should be modified to properly handle large values of options.maxSessionMemory. This can be done by using a library function that can handle large integers, such as BigInt, or by adding additional logic to prevent the value from exceeding the maximum limit. For example: if (options.maxSessionMemory > IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_SESSION_MEMORY) { throw new Error('maxSessionMemory exceeds maximum limit'); } else { optionsBuffer[IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_SESSION_MEMORY] = MathMax(1, options.maxSessionMemory); } ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
