VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in the updateOptionsBuffer function.
EXPLANATION: The updateOptionsBuffer function uses bitwise shift operators to set the IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_SETTINGS flag in the optionsBuffer. However, it does not check if the value of options.maxSettings is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_SETTINGS flag. If options.maxSettings is a large number, it could cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect value being stored in the optionsBuffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that options.maxSettings is not greater than the maximum value that can be represented by the IDX_OPTIONS_MAX_SETTINGS flag. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if options.maxSettings is less than or equal to the maximum value, and if not, throw an error or handle it accordingly. For example: if (options.maxSettings > Math.pow(2, 32) - 1) { throw new Error('options.maxSettings is too large'); }. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a BigInt, to represent large numbers.  VULNERABLE: YES
