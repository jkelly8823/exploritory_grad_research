VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack. The `setOwnProperty` function is used to set properties on the `__proto__` object, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The `setOwnProperty` function is used to set properties on the `__proto__` object, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. This is because the `__proto__` object is used to set the prototype of an object, and setting properties on it can affect the behavior of all objects that inherit from it. In this case, the `require` function is being set on the `__proto__` object, which can lead to a prototype pollution attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `setOwnProperty` function should not be used to set properties on the `__proto__` object. Instead, the `require` function should be set on the `module` object directly. Additionally, the `makeRequireFunction` function should be modified to not use the `__proto__` object. The `require_private_symbol` variable should also be removed, as it
