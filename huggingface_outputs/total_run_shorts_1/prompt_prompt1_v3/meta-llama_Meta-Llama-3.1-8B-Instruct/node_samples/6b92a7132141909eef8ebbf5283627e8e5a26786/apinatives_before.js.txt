VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential memory leak is present due to the use of a global object (kApiFunctionCache) to cache function instances. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if the cache is not properly cleared.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a global object (kApiFunctionCache) to cache function instances. This can lead to a memory leak if the cache is not properly cleared. The function Instantiate() is storing its instances in the global object, which can cause the memory usage to increase over time. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if the cache is not properly cleared.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a local cache object within the Instantiate() function. This will prevent the global object from being polluted and reduce the risk of memory leaks. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to clear the cache when it is no longer needed. This can be done by adding a function to clear the cache or by using a library that provides a cache management system.  ```javascript
var kApiFunctionCache = {};
var functionCache = kApiFunctionCache;

function Instantiate(data, name) {
  //...
  kApiFunctionCache
