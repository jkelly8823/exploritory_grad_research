VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential memory leak is present due to the use of a global variable to cache function instances. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if the cache is not properly cleared.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a global variable `kApiFunctionCache` to store function instances. This can lead to a memory leak if the cache is not properly cleared, as the garbage collector will not be able to free the memory occupied by the cached functions. Additionally, the use of a global variable can lead to unexpected behavior if multiple parts of the code try to access and modify the cache simultaneously.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a local variable or a context-specific cache instead of a global variable. Additionally, implement a mechanism to clear the cache periodically or when it reaches a certain size to prevent memory leaks. It's also a good practice to use a WeakMap to store the function instances, which will allow the garbage collector to free the memory occupied by the cached functions when they are no longer referenced. ```javascript
const cache = new WeakMap();
``` ```javascript
const cache = new WeakMap();
``` ```javascript
const cache =
