VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `traversalPath` and `traversalFolderPath` variables are constructed by concatenating user-controlled input (`allowedFolder`) with a fixed path. An attacker could manipulate the `allowedFolder` environment variable to point to a directory outside of the intended scope, allowing them to access and potentially write to arbitrary files.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `allowedFolder` variable is not properly sanitized or validated. An attacker could set the `allowedFolder` environment variable to a value like `../../../etc/passwd`, which would allow them to access the `/etc/passwd` file. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a library like `path.join()` to properly join the `allowedFolder` path with the fixed path. This will prevent an attacker from manipulating the path to access arbitrary files. For example, you could replace the lines `const traversalPath = allowedFolder + '../file.md';` and `const traversalFolderPath =
