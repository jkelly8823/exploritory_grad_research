VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential path traversal vulnerability exists in the code. This is because the `pathModule.resolve()` function is used to resolve the path, but it does not perform any validation on the input path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to access sensitive files or directories outside of the intended scope.
EXPLANATION: The `pathModule.resolve()` function is used to resolve the path, but it does not perform any validation on the input path. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to access sensitive files or directories outside of the intended scope. For example, if the input path is a relative path, an attacker could manipulate it to access a file outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the input path before passing it to the `pathModule.resolve()` function. You can use a library like `path` to validate the path and ensure it is within the intended scope. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure method to resolve paths, such as using a whitelist of allowed paths or using a path validation library.
