VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `resolvePath` function is called with user-controlled input (`path`) without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `path` variable to access sensitive files or directories outside of the intended scope.
EXPLANATION: The `resolvePath` function is called with the `path` variable, which can be a string or a Buffer. However, the function does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `path` variable to access sensitive files or directories outside of the intended scope. For example, if the `path` variable is set to `../sensitive_file`, the `resolvePath` function will resolve it to an absolute path, potentially allowing the attacker to access the sensitive file.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `path` variable before passing it to the `resolvePath` function. This can be done by using a library like `path` to normalize the path and prevent path traversal attacks. For example, the code can use `path.normalize
