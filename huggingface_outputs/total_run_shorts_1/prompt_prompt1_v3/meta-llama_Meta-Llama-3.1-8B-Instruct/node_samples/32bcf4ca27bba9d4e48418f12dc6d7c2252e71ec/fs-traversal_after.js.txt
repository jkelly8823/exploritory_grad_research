VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `path.resolve` function is being overridden to always return the input string, effectively bypassing the path resolution logic. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `path.resolve` function is used to resolve a path to an absolute path. However, in this code, it is being overridden to simply return the input string. This means that any path provided to `path.resolve` will be treated as an absolute path, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `path.resolve` function should not be overridden. Instead, the `path.resolve` function should be used as intended to resolve the path to an absolute path. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that any user-provided input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent path traversal attacks. The `path.join` function should be used to join paths together, rather than concatenating
