VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `process.nextTick()` function to schedule a callback. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can cause the process to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The `process.nextTick()` function is used to schedule a callback to be executed in the next tick of the event loop. However, if an attacker can cause the `process.nextTick()` function to be called repeatedly, it can lead to a situation where the process consumes excessive CPU resources, causing a denial-of-service. This is particularly problematic in a Node.js environment, where the event loop is designed to handle a large number of concurrent events.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a more robust scheduling mechanism, such as `setTimeout()` or `setImmediate()`, which can help prevent an attacker from causing the process to consume excessive CPU resources. Additionally, consider implementing rate limiting or other forms of protection to prevent an attacker from causing a denial-of-service. It is also recommended to review the code and ensure that it is properly handling
