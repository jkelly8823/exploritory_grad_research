VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the'require' function with a potentially untrusted module name.
EXPLANATION: The'require' function is used to load modules, but it does not perform any validation on the module name. If an attacker can manipulate the module name, they may be able to load a malicious module, potentially leading to a DoS attack. This is a classic example of a "require injection" vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the module name before loading it. This can be done by checking if the module name is a string and if it matches a set of allowed module names. Additionally, the code should use a whitelist approach to loading modules, only loading modules that are explicitly allowed. This can be achieved by using a module loader that performs validation on the module name before loading it. For example, the'require.resolve' function can be used to resolve the module name before loading it, which can help prevent require injection attacks. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is not in the require function itself, but in the fact
