VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential DNS rebinding attack. This is because the `req.resolve` and `req.reject` functions are not properly validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the DNS resolution process.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using the `req.resolve` and `req.reject` functions to handle DNS resolution and rejection, respectively. However, these functions are not properly validated, which allows an attacker to manipulate the DNS resolution process. This can lead to a DNS rebinding attack, where an attacker can trick the system into resolving a different IP address than intended.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `req.resolve` and `req.reject` functions to ensure they are properly configured and not susceptible to manipulation. This can be done by checking the function's origin and ensuring it is a trusted source. Additionally, the code should use a secure DNS resolution method, such as using a DNSSEC-aware resolver, to prevent DNS rebinding attacks. The code should also consider using a secure way to handle the `req.ttl` value, such as using a secure random number generator.
