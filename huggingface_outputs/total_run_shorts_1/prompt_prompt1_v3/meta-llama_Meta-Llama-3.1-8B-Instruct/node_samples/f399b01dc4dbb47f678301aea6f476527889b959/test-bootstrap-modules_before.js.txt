VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `assert` function with a user-controlled input (`list.join('\n')`).
EXPLANATION: The `assert` function is used to check if the length of the `list` array is within a certain limit. However, if the `list` array is very large, the `join('\n')` method will cause a stack overflow error, leading to a denial-of-service attack. This is because the `join` method creates a new string by concatenating all the elements of the array, which can be very large and cause a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust way to handle large arrays, such as using a streaming approach or a library that can handle large strings. One possible solution is to use the `Buffer` class to create a buffer that can handle large strings, and then use the `toString()` method to convert it to a string. For example: `Buffer.from(list).toString('\n')`. This will prevent the stack overflow error and make the code more robust.
