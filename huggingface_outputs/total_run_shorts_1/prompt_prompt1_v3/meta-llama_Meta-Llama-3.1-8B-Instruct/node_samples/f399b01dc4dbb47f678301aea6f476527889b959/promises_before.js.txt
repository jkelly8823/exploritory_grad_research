VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential DNS rebinding attack. This is because the `req.resolve` and `req.reject` functions are not properly validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the DNS resolution process.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using the `req.resolve` and `req.reject` functions without proper validation. This can lead to a DNS rebinding attack, where an attacker can manipulate the DNS resolution process by sending a specially crafted DNS response. The attacker can then use this to access internal resources or perform other malicious actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `req.resolve` and `req.reject` functions to ensure they are properly configured and not vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. This can be done by checking the function's origin and ensuring it is a trusted source. Additionally, the code should use a secure DNS resolution mechanism, such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH), to prevent DNS rebinding attacks. The code should also consider using a DNS library that provides built-in protection against DNS rebinding attacks.  The code should also consider using a secure DNS resolution mechanism, such as DNS over
