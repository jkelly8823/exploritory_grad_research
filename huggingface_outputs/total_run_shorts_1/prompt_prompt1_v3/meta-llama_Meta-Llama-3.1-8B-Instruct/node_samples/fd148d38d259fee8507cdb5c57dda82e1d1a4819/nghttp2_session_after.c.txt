VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of a dynamically allocated memory block (nghttp2_mem_malloc) without proper bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the allocated memory is not properly managed.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet allocates memory using nghttp2_mem_malloc without checking if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the function will return an error code, but if it succeeds, the allocated memory is not properly checked for bounds. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the allocated memory is not properly managed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of nghttp2_mem_malloc to ensure that the allocation was successful. Additionally, the code should properly check the bounds of the allocated memory to prevent buffer overflows. This can be achieved by using a safe memory management library or by implementing custom bounds checking.
