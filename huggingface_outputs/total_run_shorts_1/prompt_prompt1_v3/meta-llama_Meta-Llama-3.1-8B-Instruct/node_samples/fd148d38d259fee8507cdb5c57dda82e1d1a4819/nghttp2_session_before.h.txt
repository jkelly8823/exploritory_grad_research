VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflow due to the use of unsigned int for the Next Stream ID, which can lead to a wraparound and potentially cause unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The use of unsigned int for the Next Stream ID can cause an integer overflow when the value exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned int (2^32 - 1). This can lead to a wraparound and potentially cause unexpected behavior, such as incorrect stream IDs being assigned.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should use a signed int or a larger integer type, such as uint64_t, to prevent integer overflow and ensure that the Next Stream ID can handle the maximum possible value without wrapping around. For example, the Next Stream ID could be declared as uint64_t next_stream_id; to prevent integer overflow.  Additionally, the code should include checks to prevent the Next Stream ID from exceeding the maximum possible value.  For example, the code could include a check to ensure that the Next Stream ID is not greater than or equal to (1 << 31).  This can be done by adding a simple if statement, such as if (next_stream_id
