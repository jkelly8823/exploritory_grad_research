VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle IPv6 addresses, which can lead to incorrect results when checking if a string is an IP address.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the string starts with a '[' and ends with a ']', which is a common way to denote IPv6 addresses. However, it does not check if the string contains any valid IPv6 address components. This can lead to incorrect results when checking if a string is an IP address.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle IPv6 addresses. This can be done by checking if the string contains any valid IPv6 address components, such as four groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons. The code should also be modified to handle IPv4 addresses correctly, as the current implementation does not properly handle them. This can be done by checking if the string contains four groups of decimal digits separated by dots. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the string starts with a '0' and is followed by a dot, which is a valid IPv4 address. The code should also be modified to handle the case where the string contains a
