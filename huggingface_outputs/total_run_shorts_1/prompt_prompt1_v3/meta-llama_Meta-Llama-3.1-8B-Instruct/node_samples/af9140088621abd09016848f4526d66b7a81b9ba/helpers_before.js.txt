VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `filepath` variable is assigned the result of `fileURLToPath(destination)`, which can potentially resolve a URL to a path outside of the intended directory. If an attacker can manipulate the `destination` variable to point to a malicious URL, they may be able to access sensitive files or directories.
EXPLANATION: The `fileURLToPath` function is used to resolve a URL to a path. However, this function does not perform any validation on the input URL. If the `destination` variable is set to a URL that points to a file or directory outside of the intended directory, the `filepath` variable will be assigned the path to that file or directory. This can potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive files or directories.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the input URL before passing it to `fileURLToPath`. You can use a library such as `url` to parse the URL and ensure that it is valid. Additionally, you should ensure that the `destination` variable is not set to a URL that points to
