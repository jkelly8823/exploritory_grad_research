 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a policy manifest invalid specifier error. This is because the policy manifest file specified is invalid.
EXPLANATION: The code is attempting to load a policy manifest file from a fixtures directory. However, the file specified is named 'invalid.json', which suggests that it is intentionally invalid. The code then attempts to run a child process with the policy manifest file and a script, but the child process returns a non-zero status code, indicating that an error occurred. The error message indicates that the policy manifest file contains an invalid specifier, specifically that a pattern needs to have a single trailing '*'. This suggests that the policy manifest file is not correctly formatted.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the policy manifest file should be corrected to ensure that all patterns have a single trailing '*'. This may involve reviewing the contents of the 'invalid.json' file and making the necessary corrections. Additionally, it may be helpful to use a tool to validate the policy manifest file before attempting to load it.  The code should also be updated to handle the case where the policy manifest file is invalid, rather than simply asserting that an error occurred. This could involve
