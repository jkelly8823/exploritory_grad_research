VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a series of macro invocations for defining symbols. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The use of macros for defining symbols is a common practice in C/C++ programming, and in this case, it does not appear to introduce any security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code is secure as is.  The use of macros for defining symbols is a common practice in C/C++ programming, and in this case, it does not appear to introduce any security risks. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that the macros are being used correctly and that the symbols are being defined as intended.  Additionally, it may be beneficial to consider using a more modern approach to symbol definition, such as using a symbol table or a more robust macro system.  However, this is not a security vulnerability and is simply a suggestion for improvement.  The code is secure as is.  The use of macros for defining symbols is a common practice in C/C++ programming, and in this case
