 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a series of macro invocations for defining symbols. The PER_ISOLATE_SYMBOL_PROPERTIES macro is defined as an empty statement, which suggests that it is intended to be used as a placeholder or a no-op. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure as written. However, it would be beneficial to add comments or documentation to explain the purpose and behavior of the PER_ISOLATE_SYMBOL_PROPERTIES macro, especially if it is intended to be used in the future. This would improve code readability and maintainability.  ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
