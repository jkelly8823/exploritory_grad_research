VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a policy bypass attack. The policy file is not properly validating the module dependencies, allowing an attacker to bypass the policy by requiring a module that is not listed in the policy.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `spawnSync` function to execute a Node.js process with a policy file. However, the policy file is not properly validating the module dependencies, which allows an attacker to bypass the policy by requiring a module that is not listed in the policy. This is a classic example of a policy bypass attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the policy file should be updated to properly validate the module dependencies. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the required module is listed in the policy before executing the code. Additionally, the policy file should be updated to handle cases where the required module is not found, such as by throwing an error or returning a specific value.
