VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `ArrayPrototypeJoin` function. If the `conditions` array contains a large number of elements, the regular expression could cause a performance issue or even a crash.
EXPLANATION: The `ArrayPrototypeJoin` function is used to concatenate the elements of the `conditions` array into a string, separated by commas. However, if the array contains a large number of elements, the regular expression used in the `ArrayPrototypeJoin` function could cause a performance issue or even a crash. This is because the regular expression is used to replace commas with commas followed by a space, which can lead to a catastrophic backtracking scenario.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can use a simple string concatenation instead of a regular expression. You can use the `Array.prototype.join()` method to concatenate the elements of the `conditions` array into a string, separated by commas. For example: `ArrayPrototypeJoin([...conditions], ', ')`. Additionally, you can consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a
