VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for integer overflow when calling malloc_ex_func. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the requested size is larger than the maximum size that can be represented by the type of num.
EXPLANATION: The code checks for num <= 0, but does not check for num > INT_MAX, which can cause an integer overflow when calling malloc_ex_func. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the requested size is larger than the maximum size that can be represented by the type of num.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check for num > INT_MAX before calling malloc_ex_func. This can be done by adding the following code: if (num > INT_MAX) return NULL;. This will prevent the integer overflow and buffer overflow. Alternatively, consider using a type that can represent larger sizes, such as size_t.  Additionally, consider using a safer function like malloc_usable_size to allocate memory.  Also, consider using a safer function like realloc_usable_size to reallocate memory.
