VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function `BUF_MEM_new` allocates memory for a buffer using `OPENSSL_malloc`, but it does not check if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the function will return a pointer to a null buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow when the buffer is accessed. Additionally, the function does not check if the buffer is already allocated before attempting to allocate new memory, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should check if the allocation was successful and handle the error accordingly. It should also check if the buffer is already allocated before attempting to allocate new memory. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
BUF_MEM *BUF_MEM_new(void)
	{
	BUF_MEM *ret;

	if (str->data == NULL)
		{
		ret=OPENSSL_malloc(n);
		if (ret == NULL)
			return NULL;
		}
	else
		str->length=len;
		return(len);
		}
