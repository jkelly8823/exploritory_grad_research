VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains three instances where a buffer overflow vulnerability can occur. In each instance, the `WriteOneByte` or `WriteUtf8` method is called with a buffer size of `bufsize - 1`, but the `Write` method is called with a buffer size of `bufsize - 1` as well. However, the `Write` method does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the string, and the `WriteOneByte` and `WriteUtf8` methods do not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the string either. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string is longer than the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should check the length of the string before writing it to the buffer. You can do this by calling the `Length` method on the string object and comparing it to the buffer size. If the string is longer than the buffer size, you should either increase the buffer size or truncate the string to fit within the buffer. Additionally, you should consider using a safer method
