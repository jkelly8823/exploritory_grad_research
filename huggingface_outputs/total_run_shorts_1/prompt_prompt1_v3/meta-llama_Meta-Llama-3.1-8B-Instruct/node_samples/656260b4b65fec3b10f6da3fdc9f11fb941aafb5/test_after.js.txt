VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the potential for a large amount of memory to be allocated and not released, leading to memory corruption.
EXPLANATION: The `TestMemoryCorruption` function is called with a string of 64KB of spaces, which can cause the system to run out of memory and crash. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service attack. The `TestLargeUtf16` function is also potentially vulnerable, as it may allocate a large amount of memory to store the UTF-16 encoded string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `TestMemoryCorruption` function should be modified to handle large input strings in a way that does not cause memory allocation to grow indefinitely. This could be done by adding a check to ensure that the input string does not exceed a certain size, or by using a streaming approach to process the input string in chunks. Additionally, the `TestLargeUtf16` function should be reviewed to ensure that it does not allocate excessive memory. Consider using a library that can handle large strings efficiently, such as a streaming string library.  The
