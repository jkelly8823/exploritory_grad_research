VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential error due to the use of the '||' operator in the condition of the if statement. This can lead to a situation where the condition is always true, causing the code to throw an error unnecessarily.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the '||' operator has a higher precedence than the '&&' operator. This means that the condition 'protocol === 'data:' || (experimentalNetworkImports &&...)' will always be true when 'protocol === 'data:'' is true, regardless of the value of 'experimentalNetworkImports'. This can lead to the code throwing an error unnecessarily.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the condition should be rewritten to use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations. For example: 'protocol === 'data:' && (experimentalNetworkImports &&...)' or 'protocol!== 'data:' && experimentalNetworkImports &&...' depending on the intended logic. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the condition is correctly handling all possible scenarios.  VULNERABLE: YES
