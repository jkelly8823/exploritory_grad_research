VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `import()` function with a URL that can be manipulated by an attacker. This can lead to a situation where the code attempts to import a module that does not exist, causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `import()` function to import modules from URLs. However, the URLs are constructed using user-input data, which can be manipulated by an attacker. This allows an attacker to craft a URL that points to a non-existent module, causing the program to crash or become unresponsive. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input data before constructing the URL. This can be done by checking the format of the input data and ensuring that it conforms to the expected format. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to construct the URL, such as using a library that escapes special characters. Finally, the code should implement a fallback mechanism to handle cases where the module does not exist, such as returning
