VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer exception when accessing the `protocol` property of the `parsed` object. This is because the `protocol` property is accessed before checking if `parsed` is null, and the `protocol` property is accessed using a lazy getter.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if `parsed` is not null before accessing its properties. However, it does not check if the `protocol` property is null before accessing it. This can lead to a null pointer exception if `parsed` is null or if the `protocol` property is null. Additionally, the code uses lazy getters, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the `protocol` property is accessed before it is initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if `parsed.protocol` is not null before accessing it. This can be done by adding a null check before accessing the `protocol` property. For example: `if (parsed.protocol!= null) { protocol = parsed.protocol; }`. Additionally, the code should avoid using lazy getters and instead initialize the `protocol` property directly. This can be done by
