VULNERABLE_LINES: 34, 35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of proper validation of the HTTP request headers. An attacker can send a large number of headers, causing the server to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a crash or slowdown.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the server does not properly validate the number of HTTP request headers. The `maxHeadersCount` property is set to `null` by default, which means that there is no limit on the number of headers that can be sent. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large number of headers, causing the server to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a crash or slowdown.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `maxHeadersCount` property should be set to a reasonable value, such as 100 or 200, to prevent an attacker from sending an excessive number of headers. Additionally, the server should implement proper validation of the HTTP request headers to prevent other types of attacks. This can be achieved by using a library such as `http-parser` to parse the HTTP request headers and validate their contents.
