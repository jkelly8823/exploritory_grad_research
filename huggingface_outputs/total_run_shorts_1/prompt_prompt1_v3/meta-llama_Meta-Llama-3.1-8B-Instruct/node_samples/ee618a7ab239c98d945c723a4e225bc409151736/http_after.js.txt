VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential timing attack vulnerability exists due to the use of `setUnrefTimeout` with a timeout value that is dependent on the current time.
EXPLANATION: The `cache` function uses `setUnrefTimeout` to schedule the `resetCache` function to be called after a timeout of `1000 - d.getMilliseconds()`, where `d` is the current date. This timeout value is dependent on the current time, which can be controlled by an attacker. An attacker could potentially manipulate the timeout value to cause the `resetCache` function to be called at a predictable time, allowing them to exploit the vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a fixed timeout value instead of one that is dependent on the current time. For example, you could use `setUnrefTimeout(resetCache, 1000)` to schedule the `resetCache` function to be called after a fixed timeout of 1 second. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for scheduling timeouts, such as `setTimeout` instead of `setUnrefTimeout`.  Also, consider using a secure random number generator to generate the timeout value
