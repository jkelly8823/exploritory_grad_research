VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of validation of the `this.timeout` value. An attacker could set a very large value for `this.timeout`, causing the server to hang indefinitely.
EXPLANATION: The `this.timeout` value is set to 2 minutes (120,000 milliseconds), which is a relatively short period of time. However, an attacker could potentially set this value to a much larger number, causing the server to wait indefinitely for a response. This could lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the server becomes unresponsive and unable to handle legitimate requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `this.timeout` value to ensure it is within a reasonable range. For example, the code could check if the value is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 1 hour) and throw an error if it is. Additionally, the code could consider using a more secure approach, such as using a timer with a maximum duration to prevent the server from hanging indefinitely. ```javascript
if (this.timeout > 1 * 60 *
