RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. This code snippet is purely documentation and does not contain any code that could be vulnerable to security issues.  Please note that the code snippet is describing a server configuration option, and the actual implementation of this option would be in the server code, not in this documentation snippet.  Therefore, any vulnerabilities would be in the server code, not in this documentation snippet.  This documentation snippet is simply describing the behavior of the server configuration option.  Therefore, it is not vulnerable to security issues.  However, the server code that implements this option could potentially be vulnerable to security issues.  Therefore, it is recommended to review the server code that implements this option for any potential security vulnerabilities.  Additionally, it is recommended
