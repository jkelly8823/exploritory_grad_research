VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to the use of setUnrefTimeout with a fixed timeout value of 1000 - d.getMilliseconds(). This can lead to a situation where the cache is not reset in a timely manner, causing the function to continue to return the same date value indefinitely.
EXPLANATION: The use of setUnrefTimeout with a fixed timeout value can lead to a situation where the cache is not reset in a timely manner. This is because the timeout value is calculated based on the current time, which can lead to a situation where the timeout value is less than the actual time it takes for the cache to be reset. This can cause the function to continue to return the same date value indefinitely, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust timing mechanism, such as a timer that is based on a fixed interval rather than a fixed timeout value. Additionally, consider adding a mechanism to detect and handle cases where the cache is not reset in a timely manner. This can include adding a retry mechanism or a fallback value to
