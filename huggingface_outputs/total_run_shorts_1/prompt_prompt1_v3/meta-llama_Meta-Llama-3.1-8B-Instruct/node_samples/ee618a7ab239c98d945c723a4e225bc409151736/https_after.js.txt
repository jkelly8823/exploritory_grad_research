VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The Server class is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a timeout for the'setTimeout' method. This allows an attacker to indefinitely extend the execution time of the server, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The'setTimeout' method is being overridden to use the'setTimeout' method from the 'HttpServer' class. However, the'setTimeout' method from 'HttpServer' does not have a timeout, allowing an attacker to indefinitely extend the execution time of the server. This is a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the'setTimeout' method from 'HttpServer' should be modified to include a timeout, or the'setTimeout' method from the 'Server' class should be modified to include a timeout. Alternatively, the'setTimeout' method from 'HttpServer' could be overridden to include a timeout. This would prevent an attacker from indefinitely extending the execution time of the server.  ```javascript
