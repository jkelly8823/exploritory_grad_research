VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a use-after-free bug. The EVPKeyPointer object pkey is created from the X509_get_pubkey function, which returns a pointer to a public key. However, this pointer is then moved into the ManagedEVPPKey object epkey, which takes ownership of it. After this, the pointer to the public key is immediately freed when the EVPKeyPointer object pkey goes out of scope. The code then attempts to use this freed pointer in the X509_get_pubkey function, which will result in undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the EVPKeyPointer object pkey is created from the X509_get_pubkey function, which returns a pointer to a public key. However, this pointer is then moved into the ManagedEVPPKey object epkey, which takes ownership of it. After this, the pointer to the public key is immediately freed when the EVPKeyPointer object pkey goes out of scope. The code then attempts to use this freed pointer in the X509_get_pubkey function, which will result in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the code should
