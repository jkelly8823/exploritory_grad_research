VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct object reference.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly references the `serialNumber` property of `legacyObject` and `legacyObjectCheck`. If an attacker can manipulate the values of these properties, they may be able to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user-input data. This can be achieved by using a library or framework that supports parameterized queries, such as `mysql` or `pg`. Alternatively, use a query builder to construct the SQL query dynamically, ensuring that user-input data is properly escaped and sanitized. Additionally, consider implementing input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious data from reaching the database.  ```javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE serialNumber =?';
const params = [legacyObject.serialNumber];
db.query(query, params, (err, results) => {
  //...
});
```  ```sql
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE serialNumber =?';
