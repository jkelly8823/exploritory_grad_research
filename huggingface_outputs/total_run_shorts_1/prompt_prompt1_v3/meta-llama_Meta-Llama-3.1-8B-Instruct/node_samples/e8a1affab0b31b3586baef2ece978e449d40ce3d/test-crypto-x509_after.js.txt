 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not handle the case where the subjectPublicKey in the TBSCertificate is not a valid public key. This can lead to an error when trying to access the publicKey property of the X509Certificate object.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to parse an X.509 certificate using OpenSSL. However, the certificate contains a subjectPublicKey that is not a valid public key. When trying to access the publicKey property of the X509Certificate object, it will throw an error. This is because the publicKey property is not designed to handle invalid public keys.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add a check to ensure that the subjectPublicKey is a valid public key before trying to access the publicKey property. This can be done by using a library that can validate public keys, such as the crypto library in Node.js. Alternatively, the code can be modified to handle the case where the subjectPublicKey is not a valid public key, such as by returning an error or a default value. ```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

//...

const cert = new X509Certificate(certPem);
if (!crypto.publicKey.verify(cert.subjectPublicKey
