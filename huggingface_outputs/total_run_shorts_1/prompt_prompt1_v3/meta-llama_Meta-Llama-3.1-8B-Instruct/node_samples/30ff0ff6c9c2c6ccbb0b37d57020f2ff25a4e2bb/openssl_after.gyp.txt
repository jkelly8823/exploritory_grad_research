VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to the use of the'modules_dir' variable in the 'defines' list without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The'modules_dir' variable is used to construct a path that is then used in the 'defines' list. However, the variable is not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to manipulate the path and potentially access sensitive files. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the'modules_dir' variable should be properly sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be done by using a function like 'os.path.join' to join the directory path with the module name, or by using a library like 'pathlib' to handle path manipulation safely. Additionally, the 'defines' list should be reviewed to ensure that no other variables are used without proper sanitization.  The 'node_shared_openssl=="false"' condition should also be reviewed to ensure it is not being used to bypass security checks.  It is also recommended to use a more secure way to define the 'MODULESDIR' variable, such
