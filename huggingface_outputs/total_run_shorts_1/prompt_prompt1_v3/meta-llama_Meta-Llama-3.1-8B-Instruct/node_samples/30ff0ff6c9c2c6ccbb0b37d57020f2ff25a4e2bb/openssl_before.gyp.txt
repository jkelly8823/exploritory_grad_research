VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential path traversal vulnerability due to the use of the 'PRODUCT_DIR_ABS' variable in the 'openssl_dir' and'modules_dir' definitions. This variable is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate the directory path and access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'PRODUCT_DIR_ABS' variable should be validated and sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a library function that checks for valid directory paths, such as 'path.normalize()' or 'path.isabs()'. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to define the 'openssl_dir' and'modules_dir' variables, such as using a constant or a secure configuration file.  Also, ensure that the 'node_shared_openssl' variable is properly validated to prevent unintended behavior.  Consider using a whitelist approach to validate the 'node_shared_openssl' variable to ensure it only accepts expected values.  Finally, ensure that the 'defines' section is properly sanitized to prevent any potential code injection attacks.  Consider using a library function that checks for
