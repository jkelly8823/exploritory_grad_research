VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `resolvePath` function is called with a potentially user-controlled input (`path`) without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The `resolvePath` function is used to resolve the absolute path of a file. However, if the `path` parameter is a Buffer object, it is not properly sanitized before being passed to `resolvePath`. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the path and access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the `path` parameter before passing it to `resolvePath`. This can be done by using a library like `path` to normalize the path and prevent any potential path traversal attacks. For example, the code could use `path.normalize` to normalize the path before passing it to `resolvePath`. Additionally, the code should also check if the `path` parameter is a string or a Buffer object and handle each case separately to prevent any potential errors.
