VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `resolvePath` function is called with a potentially user-controlled input, and the result is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `resolvePath` function is called with a potentially user-controlled input, which can lead to a path traversal attack. This is because the function does not properly sanitize the input, and can resolve paths that are outside of the intended directory. This can lead to unintended behavior, such as accessing sensitive files or directories.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `resolvePath` function should be called with a sanitized input. This can be achieved by using a library such as `path` to normalize the input path, and then calling `resolvePath` with the normalized path. Additionally, the `permission.isEnabled()` check should be removed, as it is not necessary to enable the permission model for this function. The corrected code should look like this:
```javascript
function possiblyTransformPath(path) {
  if (typeof path ==='string') {
    return pathModule.resolve(path);
  } else if (Buffer.isBuffer(path)) {
