VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer traversal vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code creates a Buffer object from a string that contains a traversal path. This can be used to traverse the file system in an unintended way, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a library like path to properly resolve the path and avoid creating a Buffer object from a string that contains a traversal path. Instead, use the path.join function to join the allowedFolder path with the file or folder name. For example: const traversalPath = path.join(allowedFolder, '../file.md');. This will prevent the buffer traversal vulnerability. Additionally, consider using a library like fs-extra to handle file system operations in a more secure way.  ```javascript
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs-extra');

const traversalPath = path.join(allowedFolder, '../file.md');
const traversalFolderPath = path.join(allowedFolder, '../folder');

fs.access(traversalPath, fs.constants.R_OK, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
});
```  ```javascript
