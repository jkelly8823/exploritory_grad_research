VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the `val` parameter in the `nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack` and `nghttp2_option_set_max_settings` functions.
EXPLANATION: The `val` parameter is assigned directly to the `max_outbound_ack` and `max_settings` fields without any checks to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed value. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if a large value is passed to the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the `val` parameter does not exceed the maximum allowed value. For example, you can use the `nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack` and `nghttp2_option_set_max_settings` functions to set the maximum allowed value before assigning the `val` parameter to the corresponding field. Alternatively, you can use a safer data type, such as `uint32_t`, to store the maximum allowed value. Additionally, consider using a more robust validation mechanism, such as a whitelist of allowed values, to further mitigate the risk of buffer overflow.  ```c
