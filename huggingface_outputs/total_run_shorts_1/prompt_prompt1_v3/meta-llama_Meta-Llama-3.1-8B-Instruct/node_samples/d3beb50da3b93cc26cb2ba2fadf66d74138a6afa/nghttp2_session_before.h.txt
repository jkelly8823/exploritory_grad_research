 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a header file for an HTTP/2 session implementation. It defines several variables and function prototypes related to HTTP/2 session management. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). The use of unsigned integers for stream IDs and error codes is a good practice to prevent underflow issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address security vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security.  ```bash
