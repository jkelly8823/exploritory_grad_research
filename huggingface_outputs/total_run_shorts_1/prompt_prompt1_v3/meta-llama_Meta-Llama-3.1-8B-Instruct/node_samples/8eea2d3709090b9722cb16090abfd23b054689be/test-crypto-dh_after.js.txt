 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of an assert.throws() statement with a custom error message. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The assert.throws() statement is used to test whether a function call throws an exception. However, in this case, the custom error message is not properly sanitized, which can lead to a potential security vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate the error message to cause the application to crash or become unresponsive. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the custom error message should be properly sanitized to prevent an attacker from manipulating it. This can be achieved by using a secure method to generate the error message, such as using a template engine or a secure string concatenation method. Additionally, the application should be designed to handle unexpected errors in a secure manner, such as by logging the error and continuing to operate. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all error messages are properly sanitized and secure.
