 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a weak Diffie-Hellman (DH) key. The `dh3.computeSecret` function is called with an empty string, which is a very small key. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack because the function will throw an error, but the error message is not informative and does not provide any information about the cause of the error.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `dh3.computeSecret` function to compute a shared secret between two parties. However, the function is called with an empty string, which is a very small key. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack because the function will throw an error, but the error message is not informative and does not provide any information about the cause of the error. The error message is also not consistent across different versions of OpenSSL.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the key before calling the `dh3.computeSecret` function. If the key is too small, the function should return an error message that provides information about the
