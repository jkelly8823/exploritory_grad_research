VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The destructor of the Http2Session class does not check if the session_ pointer is null before deleting it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the session_ pointer is null.
EXPLANATION: The destructor of the Http2Session class is responsible for deleting the nghttp2 session. However, it does not check if the session_ pointer is null before deleting it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the session_ pointer is null. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the destructor should check if the session_ pointer is null before deleting it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before calling nghttp2_session_del(session_). The corrected code should look like this: if (session_!= nullptr) nghttp2_session_del(session_);. This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure that the destructor is safe to use.  Additionally, it would be a good idea to consider using a smart pointer to manage the nghttp2 session, which would eliminate the need for manual memory management and prevent this type of vulnerability.
