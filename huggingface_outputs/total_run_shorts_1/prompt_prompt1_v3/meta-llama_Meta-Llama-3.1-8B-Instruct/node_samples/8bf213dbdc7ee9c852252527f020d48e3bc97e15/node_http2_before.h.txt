VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a C++ class definition for an HTTP/2 stream. It includes private member variables for the session, stream identifier, RST_STREAM code, internal state flags, and maximum header pairs. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). However, it is worth noting that the use of raw pointers (Http2Session*) may be a potential issue if not properly managed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Consider using smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) to manage the Http2Session object instead of raw pointers. This can help prevent memory leaks and other issues related to pointer management. Additionally, consider using const correctness to ensure that member variables are not modified unnecessarily.  ```bash
