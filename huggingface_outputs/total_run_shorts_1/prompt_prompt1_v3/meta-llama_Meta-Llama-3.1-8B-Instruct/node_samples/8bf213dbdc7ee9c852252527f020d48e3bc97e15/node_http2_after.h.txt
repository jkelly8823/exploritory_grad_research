 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a class definition for a statistics object. It includes private member variables for an HTTP/2 session, stream identifier, RST_STREAM code, internal state flags, and maximum header pairs. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). However, it is worth noting that the use of raw pointers (Http2Session*) may be a potential issue in terms of memory management and potential null pointer dereferences.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Consider using smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) to manage the memory of the Http2Session object.
2. Add null checks for the Http2Session pointer to prevent potential null pointer dereferences.  ```VULNERABLE: NO
