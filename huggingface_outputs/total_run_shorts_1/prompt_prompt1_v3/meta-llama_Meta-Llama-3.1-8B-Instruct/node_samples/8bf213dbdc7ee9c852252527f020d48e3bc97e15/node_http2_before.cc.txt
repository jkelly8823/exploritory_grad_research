VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The destructor Http2Session::~Http2Session() does not check if the session_ pointer is null before deleting it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the session_ pointer is null.
EXPLANATION: The destructor Http2Session::~Http2Session() does not check if the session_ pointer is null before deleting it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the session_ pointer is null. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability. The session_ pointer is set to null in the RemoveStream function, but the destructor does not check for this before deleting the session.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a null check before deleting the session_ pointer in the destructor. The corrected code should look like this: if (session_!= nullptr) { nghttp2_session_del(session_); } else { // handle the case where session_ is null }  or  nghttp2_session_del(session_); // nghttp2_session_del will handle the null case. However, it is generally safer to check for null before deleting.  The RemoveStream function should also be modified to set the session_ pointer to
