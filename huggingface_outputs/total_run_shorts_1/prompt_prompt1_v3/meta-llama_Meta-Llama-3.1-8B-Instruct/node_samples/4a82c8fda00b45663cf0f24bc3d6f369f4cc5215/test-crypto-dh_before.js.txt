VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential Diffie-Hellman key exchange vulnerability. This is because the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is being used with a static string as the generator, which is not secure.
EXPLANATION: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a key exchange protocol that is vulnerable to certain attacks when used with static strings as the generator. This is because static strings can be easily guessed or brute-forced, allowing an attacker to compromise the security of the key exchange. In this code snippet, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is being used with a static string as the generator, which makes it vulnerable to these types of attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a secure random number generator to generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange parameters. This can be done using the crypto module's randomBytes function, which generates a cryptographically secure random number. For example, you can use the following code to generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange parameters: crypto.createDiffieHellman(crypto.randomBytes(32), 'base64', crypto.randomBytes(32)). This will ensure that
