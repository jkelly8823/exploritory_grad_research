VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `chunk_extensions_nread_` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `on_chunk_extension` function increments the `chunk_extensions_nread_` variable without checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed size `kMaxChunkExtensionsSize`. This allows an attacker to overflow the buffer by sending a large chunk extension, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the `on_chunk_extension` function to ensure that `chunk_extensions_nread_` does not exceed `kMaxChunkExtensionsSize`. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the new value of `chunk_extensions_nread_` is greater than the maximum allowed size. If it is, return an error code or set an error flag. For example: `if (chunk_extensions_nread_ + length > kMaxChunkExtensionsSize) {... }`. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as `size_t`, to store the `chunk_extensions_nread_` value to prevent overflows. ```c
