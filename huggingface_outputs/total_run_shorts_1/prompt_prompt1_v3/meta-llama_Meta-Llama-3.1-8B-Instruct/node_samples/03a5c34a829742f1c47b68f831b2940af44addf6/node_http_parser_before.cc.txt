VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `header_nread_` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `header_nread_` variable is used to track the number of bytes read from the HTTP header. However, it is not checked for overflow, which means that if the header is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in `header_nread_`, it will wrap around and potentially overwrite adjacent variables, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the `header_nread_` variable to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint64_t`. This can be done by checking if `header_nread_` is greater than or equal to `max_http_header_size_` before incrementing it. If it is, return an error or handle the overflow accordingly. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as `size_t`, to store the number of bytes read from the header. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the `on_chunk_header()` function, which is not shown in the provided
