 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling attacks due to the use of the 'Connection: close' header in the responses for chunk extensions too large and header fields too large. This allows an attacker to manipulate the request and response headers to smuggle HTTP requests.
EXPLANATION: The 'Connection: close' header is used to close the connection after the response is sent. However, in the context of HTTP request smuggling, an attacker can manipulate the request and response headers to smuggle HTTP requests. By using the 'Connection: close' header in the responses for chunk extensions too large and header fields too large, the code is vulnerable to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use the 'Connection: keep-alive' header in the responses for chunk extensions too large and header fields too large. This will prevent an attacker from manipulating the request and response headers to smuggle HTTP requests. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly handling HTTP request smuggling attacks.
