VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling attacks. This is because the server is not properly handling the 'Connection: close' header, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject additional headers into the request.
EXPLANATION: The 'Connection: close' header is used to indicate that the client wants to close the connection after the request is sent. However, if an attacker can manipulate this header, they can inject additional headers into the request, which can be used to smuggle requests past the server's security checks. In this case, the server is not properly handling the 'Connection: close' header, which makes it vulnerable to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the server should be configured to properly handle the 'Connection: close' header. This can be done by setting the 'Connection' header to 'close' only after the request has been fully processed, and not before. Additionally, the server should be configured to reject any requests that contain a 'Connection: close' header, as this can be a sign of an HTTP request smuggling attack. Finally, the server should be configured to properly handle
