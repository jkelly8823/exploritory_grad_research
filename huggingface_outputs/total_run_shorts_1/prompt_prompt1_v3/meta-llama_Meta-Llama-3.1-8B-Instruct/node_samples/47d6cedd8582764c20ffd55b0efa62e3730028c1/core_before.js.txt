VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the `checkIsHttpToken` function. This function is called with user-controlled input, and if it is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially cause the function to enter an infinite loop or crash the application.
EXPLANATION: The `checkIsHttpToken` function is called with user-controlled input, and it is not properly validated. This function is used to determine whether a given string is a valid HTTP token. If the input is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially cause the function to enter an infinite loop or crash the application. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `checkIsHttpToken` function should be modified to properly validate its input. This can be done by using a regular expression to match the input against a valid HTTP token pattern. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle invalid input in a way that prevents it from entering an infinite loop or crashing the application. For example, the function could return an error or
