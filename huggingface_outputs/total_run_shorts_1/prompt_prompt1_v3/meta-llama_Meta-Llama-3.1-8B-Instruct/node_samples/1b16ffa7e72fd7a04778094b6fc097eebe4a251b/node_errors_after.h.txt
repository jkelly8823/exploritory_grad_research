 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a series of error message definitions, likely for a cryptographic library. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet consists of a series of macro definitions, each defining an error message. The error messages are defined using the V macro, which is likely a custom macro for defining error messages. The code does not contain any syntax errors or obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the error messages themselves may not be secure if they contain sensitive information, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the error messages for sensitive information and ensure that they are secure.  ```bash
```bash
V(ERR_CRYPTO_INVALID_AUTH_TAG, TypeError)                                    \
```bash
This line contains a potential vulnerability. The TypeError exception is not a secure way to handle authentication errors. It is recommended to use a more secure exception type, such as ValueError or AuthenticationError.
EXPLANATION: 
The use of TypeError to handle authentication errors is
