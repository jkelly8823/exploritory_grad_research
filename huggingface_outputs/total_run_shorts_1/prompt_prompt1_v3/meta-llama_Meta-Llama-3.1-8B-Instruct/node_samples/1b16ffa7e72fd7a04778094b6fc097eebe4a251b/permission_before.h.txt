VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function ThrowAccessDenied does not check if the Environment object is null before dereferencing it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the Environment object is null.
EXPLANATION: The function ThrowAccessDenied takes an Environment object as a parameter, but it does not check if the object is null before using it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the Environment object is null. This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function ThrowAccessDenied should be modified to check if the Environment object is null before using it. This can be done by adding a simple null check at the beginning of the function. For example: if (env == nullptr) { throw std::invalid_argument("Environment object is null"); } else { // rest of the function } This will prevent the null pointer dereference vulnerability.  ```c
