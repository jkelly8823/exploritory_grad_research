VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of a raw pointer in a multithreaded environment.
EXPLANATION: The `inspector_parent_handle_` is assigned a value in a multithreaded environment, but it is not properly synchronized. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability if the `inspector_parent_handle_` is accessed after the original object has been deleted.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a thread-safe data structure to store the `inspector_parent_handle_` or synchronize access to it using a mutex. Additionally, consider using a smart pointer to manage the memory of the `inspector_parent_handle_`.
