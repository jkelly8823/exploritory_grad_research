VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. This is because the `nodes_` map is being populated with shared pointers to objects that are created on the stack and then destroyed when they go out of scope. This can lead to undefined behavior when the shared pointers are accessed later.
EXPLANATION: The `std::make_shared` function is used to create shared pointers to objects that are created on the stack. However, these objects are destroyed when they go out of scope, which means that the shared pointers will be pointing to memory that has already been freed. This can lead to undefined behavior when the shared pointers are accessed later. In this case, the `nodes_` map is being populated with shared pointers to objects that are created on the stack, which means that the shared pointers will be pointing to memory that has already been freed when the `nodes_` map is accessed later.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the objects should be created on the heap instead of the stack. This can be done by using the `new` operator to create the objects on the heap, and then using the `std::shared
