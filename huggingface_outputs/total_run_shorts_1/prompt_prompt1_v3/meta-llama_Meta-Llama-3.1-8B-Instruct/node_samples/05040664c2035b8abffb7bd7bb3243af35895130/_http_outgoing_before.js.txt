VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists due to the use of a null value for the encoding variable.
EXPLANATION: The encoding variable is initialized to null and then used in the connection.write() method without being checked for null. If the encoding variable is null, it could lead to a null pointer dereference error when the connection.write() method attempts to use it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The encoding variable should be checked for null before using it in the connection.write() method. This can be done by adding a simple null check before calling connection.write(). For example: if (encoding!== null) { connection.write(data, encoding, callback); } else { // handle the case where encoding is null }.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists due to the use of a null value for the connection variable.
EXPLANATION: The connection variable is checked for null before being used, but the check is not sufficient to prevent a null pointer dereference error. If the connection variable is null, the connection.write() method will still be
