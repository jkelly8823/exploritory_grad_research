VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  There are no vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The code is a CMake build script that sets up a project for building the llhttp library. It defines options, sources, headers, and installation targets. The code follows best practices for CMake usage and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it's always a good idea to review the code and ensure that it aligns with the project's security policies and guidelines. 
```python
def find_vulnerabilities(code):
    # Parse the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
    tree = ast.parse(code)

    # Initialize a list to store vulnerability information
    vulnerabilities = []

    # Iterate over the top-level statements in the code
    for node in tree.body:
        # Check for potential vulnerabilities in each statement
        if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
            # Check for function calls with no arguments
            for call in node.body:
                if isinstance(call, ast.Call):
                    if not call.args:
                        vulnerabilities.append({
