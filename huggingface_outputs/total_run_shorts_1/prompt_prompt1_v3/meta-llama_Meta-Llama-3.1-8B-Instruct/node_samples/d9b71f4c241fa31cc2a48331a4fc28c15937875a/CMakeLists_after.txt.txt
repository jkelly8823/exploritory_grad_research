VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential issue with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable being set to an invalid value. This is because the `string(TOUPPER ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)` line does not handle the case where the input string is not a valid CMake build type.
EXPLANATION: The `string(TOUPPER ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)` line is used to convert the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable to uppercase. However, if the input string is not a valid CMake build type, this line will not raise an error. Instead, it will simply convert the string to uppercase and store it in the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the build type is not one of the allowed values.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to check if the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable is a valid CMake build type before attempting to convert it to uppercase. This can be done by using the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable in a `list` function to check if it is one
