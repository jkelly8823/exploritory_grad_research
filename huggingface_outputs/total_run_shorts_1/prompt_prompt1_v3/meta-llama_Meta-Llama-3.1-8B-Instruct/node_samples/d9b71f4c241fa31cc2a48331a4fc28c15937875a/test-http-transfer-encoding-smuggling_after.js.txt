VULNERABLE_LINES: 23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the server not properly handling the client's request, leading to an infinite loop of requests.
EXPLANATION: The server is not properly handling the client's request, as it is not checking for any conditions that would cause it to stop listening for requests. This can lead to an infinite loop of requests, causing the server to consume increasing amounts of resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the server should be modified to properly handle the client's request, such as by checking for a specific condition that would cause it to stop listening for requests. This could be done by adding a conditional statement to the server's callback function to check for the condition and stop listening if it is met. For example: `if (condition) { server.close(); }`. Additionally, the server should be configured to limit the number of incoming requests to prevent an infinite loop of requests. This could be done by using a rate limiting library or by implementing a custom solution to limit the number of requests.  The server should also be configured to handle
