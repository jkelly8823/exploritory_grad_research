VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains multiple vulnerabilities related to the use of the `XX` macro. The `XX` macro is used to define enum values, but it is not properly defined. This can lead to undefined behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The `XX` macro is used to define enum values, but it is not properly defined. The macro is used to define multiple enum values in a single line, but it does not check if the enum value is already defined. This can lead to duplicate enum values, which can cause undefined behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the `XX` macro does not check if the enum value is within the valid range, which can lead to out-of-range values and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `XX` macro should be properly defined to check for duplicate enum values and out-of-range values. The macro should also be used consistently throughout the code to ensure that enum values
