VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential HTTP request smuggling vulnerability due to the presence of a non-standard Transfer-Encoding header value ("eee, chunked").
EXPLANATION: The Transfer-Encoding header is used to indicate that the request body is encoded in a specific way. However, in this case, the value "eee, chunked" is not a standard value for this header. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the request body and smuggle additional requests, leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the Transfer-Encoding header should be removed or set to a standard value ("chunked"). Additionally, the Content-Length header should be removed, as it is not necessary when using chunked encoding. The request should also be validated to ensure that it conforms to standard HTTP protocol requirements.  ```python
import requests

def exploit_request():
    headers = {
        'Host': 'hacker.exploit.com',
        'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        'Content-Length': '10',
        'Transfer-Encoding': 'eee, chunked'
    }
