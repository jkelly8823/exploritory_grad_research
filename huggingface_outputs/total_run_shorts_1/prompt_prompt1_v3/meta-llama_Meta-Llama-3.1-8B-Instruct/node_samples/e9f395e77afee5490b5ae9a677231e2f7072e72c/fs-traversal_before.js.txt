VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a path traversal vulnerability. This is because the `traversalPath` variable is constructed by concatenating the `allowedFolder` environment variable with `../file.md`. This allows an attacker to traverse the directory structure by manipulating the `allowedFolder` environment variable. The vulnerability is present in the line where `traversalPath` is assigned a value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a path manipulation function like `path.join()` to construct the `traversalPath` variable. This function will ensure that the path is correctly resolved and prevent path traversal attacks. For example, the corrected code should look like this: `const traversalPath = path.join(allowedFolder, '../file.md');`. Additionally, the code should validate the `allowedFolder` environment variable to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters. This can be done by using a library like `path.normalize()` to normalize the path and prevent any directory traversal.  VULNERABLE: YES
