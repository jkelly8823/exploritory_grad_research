VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a permission bypass attack due to the monkey-patching of the path module.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to freeze the path module to prevent it from being monkey-patched. However, this is not sufficient to prevent a permission bypass attack. An attacker could still monkey-patch the path module by using a different method, such as using a different module or creating a new module with the same name. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the permission model and potentially access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to prevent monkey-patching, such as using a secure module system or implementing a permission model that is not based on module freezing. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all potential entry points for monkey-patching are addressed. The use of experimental features should also be avoided whenever possible.
