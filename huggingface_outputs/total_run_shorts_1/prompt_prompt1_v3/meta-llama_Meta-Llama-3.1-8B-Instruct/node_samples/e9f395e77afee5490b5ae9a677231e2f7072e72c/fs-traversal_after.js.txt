VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. This is because the `path.resolve` function is being monkey-patched to return the input string unchanged, and the `path.toNamespacedPath` function is being monkey-patched to return a path that is outside of the allowed folder.
EXPLANATION: The code is attempting to prevent path traversal attacks by monkey-patching the `path` module. However, the monkey-patching is not sufficient to prevent attacks. The `path.resolve` function is being monkey-patched to return the input string unchanged, which means that an attacker can still use the `../` syntax to traverse outside of the allowed folder. Additionally, the `path.toNamespacedPath` function is being monkey-patched to return a path that is outside of the allowed folder, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the allowed folder.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to prevent path traversal attacks, such as using a library like `path-normalize` or `path-join`. Additionally, the code should ensure that the `path` module is not monkey-patched, and instead
