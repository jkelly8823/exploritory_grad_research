VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a set of preprocessor directives that define version numbers and a flag for strict mode. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a standard and safe use of preprocessor directives.  The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security risks.  However, it is worth noting that the use of preprocessor directives can sometimes lead to issues with code readability and maintainability. Consider using a more modern approach to versioning and configuration, such as using a configuration file or a build system.  Additionally, the use of a single flag for strict mode may not be sufficient for all use cases. Consider adding more flags or using a more sophisticated approach to configuration.  However, these are not security-related issues, but rather best practices for code organization and maintainability.  Overall, this code snippet appears to be safe and well-structured.  It does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.  It is worth noting that the use of
