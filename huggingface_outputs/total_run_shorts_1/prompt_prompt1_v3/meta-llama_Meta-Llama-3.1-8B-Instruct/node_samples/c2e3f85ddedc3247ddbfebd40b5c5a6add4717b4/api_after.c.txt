 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The `wasm_on_headers_complete_wrap` function uses the `p->status_code` and `p->upgrade` fields of the `llhttp_t` struct, but these fields are not guaranteed to be valid after the `wasm_on_headers_complete` function has been called. This is because the `wasm_on_headers_complete` function may free the `llhttp_t` struct, leaving the `p` pointer pointing to invalid memory.
EXPLANATION: The `wasm_on_headers_complete` function is called with a pointer to the `llhttp_t` struct, and it may free the struct if the `should_keep_alive` parameter is 0. However, the `wasm_on_headers_complete_wrap` function uses the `p->status_code` and `p->upgrade` fields of the `llhttp_t` struct, which are not guaranteed to be valid after the `wasm_on_headers_complete` function has been called. This is a use-after-free vulnerability, which can cause the program to access memory that has already been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
