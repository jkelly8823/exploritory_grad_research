VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function wasm_on_body is not assigned to the corresponding field in the llhttp_settings_t struct.
EXPLANANATION: The function wasm_on_body is declared as an external function, but it is not assigned to the corresponding field in the llhttp_settings_t struct. This could lead to a null pointer dereference when the wasm_on_body function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Assign the wasm_on_body function to the corresponding field in the llhttp_settings_t struct. The corrected line should look like this: wasm_on_body, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, wasm_on_body, wasm_on_message_complete, NULL, NULL.  The NULL values are placeholders for the other fields that are not assigned in this code snippet.  The corrected line should be:  wasm_on_body, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, wasm_on_body, wasm_on_message_complete, NULL, NULL.  The NULL values are placeholders for the other fields that are not assigned in this code snippet.  The corrected line should be:  wasm_on_body, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, wasm_on_body, wasm_on_message_complete
