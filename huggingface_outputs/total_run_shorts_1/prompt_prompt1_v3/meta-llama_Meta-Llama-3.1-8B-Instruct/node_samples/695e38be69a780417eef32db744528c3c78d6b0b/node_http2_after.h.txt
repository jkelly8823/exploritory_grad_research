VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a C++ class definition, specifically the method declarations for handling HTTP/2 frames. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). The method declarations are well-structured and follow standard C++ naming conventions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address potential vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues and consider using static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities.  ```bash
