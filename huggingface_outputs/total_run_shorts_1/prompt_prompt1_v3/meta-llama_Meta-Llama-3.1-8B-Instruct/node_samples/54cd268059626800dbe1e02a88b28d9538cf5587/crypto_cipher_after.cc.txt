VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of EVP_PKEY_decrypt_init() without checking the length of the input data.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_decrypt_init() function does not perform any checks on the length of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow attack if the input data is larger than the expected size. This is a serious vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input data before calling EVP_PKEY_decrypt_init(). This can be done by using the EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str() function to get the maximum allowed length of the input data and then checking if the actual length of the input data is within the allowed range. If the length is not within the allowed range, an error should be thrown. Additionally, the code should also check the return value of EVP_PKEY_decrypt_init() to ensure that it is successful. If the return value is not successful, an error should be thrown.
