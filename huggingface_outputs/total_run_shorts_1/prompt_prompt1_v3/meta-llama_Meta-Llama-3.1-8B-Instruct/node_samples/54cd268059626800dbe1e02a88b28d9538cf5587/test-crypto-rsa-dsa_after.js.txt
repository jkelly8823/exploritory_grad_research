VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of crypto.privateDecrypt with different keys and padding schemes. This can allow an attacker to determine the padding scheme used by the server.
EXPLANATION: The crypto.privateDecrypt function is used with different keys and padding schemes in the same function. This can allow an attacker to measure the time it takes for the function to complete, which can be used to determine the padding scheme used by the server. This is a classic example of a timing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a constant key and padding scheme for all crypto.privateDecrypt calls. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a secure random number generator to generate a random key and padding scheme for each call, and then use a secure method to compare the results. The assert.throws calls should also be removed, as they are not necessary and can be used to exploit the timing attack.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other timing attacks.  The use of crypto.privateDecrypt with different keys and padding schemes in the same function is a
