VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the realloc function without bounds checking. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The realloc function is used to resize a memory block to a specified size. However, if the new size is larger than the current size, realloc will allocate a new block of memory and copy the contents of the old block to the new block. If the new size is smaller than the current size, realloc will shrink the block to the new size. However, if the new size is larger than the current size and the old block is not large enough to hold the new size, realloc will return a null pointer. In this case, the code does not check for the return value of realloc, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of realloc and handle the case where it returns a null pointer. This can be done by checking if the return value is null before assigning it to the ptr variable. Additionally, the code should also check the bounds of the new size
