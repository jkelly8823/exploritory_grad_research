VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `strcat` function without checking the length of the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `strcat` function appends the string pointed to by `WIN_PATH_HOSTS` to the end of the string pointed to by `PATH_HOSTS`. However, if `WIN_PATH_HOSTS` is longer than the remaining space in `PATH_HOSTS`, it will overflow the buffer, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the `strncat` function instead, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to append. For example: `strncat(PATH_HOSTS, WIN_PATH_HOSTS, MAX_PATH - strlen(PATH_HOSTS) - 1);`. Additionally, consider using a safer string concatenation function, such as `snprintf`. It's also a good practice to check the length of the destination buffer before using `strcat` or `strncat`.  Also, consider using `PathCat` function which is designed
