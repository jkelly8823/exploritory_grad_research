 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `ArrayPrototypeSome` method without a proper check for the `dnsNames` array length. If the `dnsNames` array is empty, the `ArrayPrototypeSome` method will throw an error, leading to a potential DoS attack.
EXPLANATION: The `ArrayPrototypeSome` method is used to check if at least one element in the `dnsNames` array matches the `wildcard` function. However, if the `dnsNames` array is empty, the `ArrayPrototypeSome` method will throw an error, leading to a potential DoS attack. This is because the `ArrayPrototypeSome` method does not handle the case where the array is empty, and will attempt to iterate over the array, leading to the error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add a check to ensure that the `dnsNames` array is not empty before calling the `ArrayPrototypeSome` method. This can be done by adding a simple `if` statement to check the length of the `dnsNames` array
