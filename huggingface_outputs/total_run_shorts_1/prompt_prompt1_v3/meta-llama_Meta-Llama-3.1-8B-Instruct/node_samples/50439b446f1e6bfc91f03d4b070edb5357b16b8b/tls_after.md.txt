VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531, a security vulnerability that allows for the acceptance of certificates with a matching uniformResourceIdentifier subject alternative name, even if the certificate is not issued by a trusted CA.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it does not properly check the certificate against the hostname, allowing for the acceptance of certificates with a matching uniformResourceIdentifier subject alternative name. This is a security vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to obtain a malicious certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, a custom options.checkServerIdentity function should be implemented that implements the desired behavior for accepting uniformResourceIdentifier subject alternative names. This function should properly check the certificate against the hostname and reject certificates that do not meet the desired criteria. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a secure cipher suite, such as TLSv1.3, and to reject certificates that are not issued by a trusted CA.  ```javascript
function checkServerIdentity(hostname, cert) {
  // Implement custom logic to check the certificate against the hostname
  // and reject certificates that do not meet the desired criteria
}
``` ```javascript
options.check
