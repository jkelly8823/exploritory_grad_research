VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a certificate validation issue. The code is checking for a DNS name in the certificate, but it is not properly handling cases where the certificate contains a subjectAltName with a URI or IP address.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a simple check to see if the certificate contains a DNS name. However, this check is not sufficient to handle all possible cases. For example, a certificate can contain a subjectAltName with a URI or IP address, but still be valid. The code should be modified to properly handle these cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to properly handle certificates with subjectAltName fields that contain URIs or IP addresses. This can be done by checking the type of the subjectAltName field and handling it accordingly. For example, if the subjectAltName field contains a URI, the code should check if the URI matches the host name. If the subjectAltName field contains an IP address, the code should check if the IP address matches the host IP address. If the subjectAltName field does not contain a DNS name, the code should still validate the certificate using other means, such as
