 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5, 7, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack due to the lack of proper validation of the certificate's subject alternative name (SAN) field. This allows an attacker to intercept and modify the communication between the client and the server.
EXPLANATION: The code is checking if the host matches the SAN field, but it is not properly validating the SAN field. In the first case, the SAN field is empty, which means the code will not throw an error. In the second case, the SAN field contains a DNS name, but the code is not checking if the host matches the DNS name. In the third case, the SAN field contains a wildcard DNS name, which can be used to intercept communication with multiple hosts. In the fourth case, the SAN field contains an IP address, which can be used to intercept communication with a specific host.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the SAN field. This can be done by checking if the host matches the SAN field, and if the SAN field is a DNS name or an IP address
