VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a TLS protocol downgrade attack. This is because the code does not specify a minimum TLS version, allowing an attacker to negotiate a lower version of the protocol.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `tls.connect()` function without specifying a minimum TLS version. This allows an attacker to negotiate a lower version of the TLS protocol, potentially allowing them to exploit known vulnerabilities in older versions of the protocol. The use of the `options.minVersion` property is recommended to prevent this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, specify a minimum TLS version using the `options.minVersion` property. For example: `options.minVersion = 'TLSv1.2';`. This will ensure that the TLS connection is established using a secure version of the protocol. Additionally, consider using the `options.maxVersion` property to specify the maximum allowed TLS version. This will prevent an attacker from negotiating a higher version of the protocol than intended.  VULNERABLE: YES
