VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a TLS renegotiation attack. This is because the server is not configured to prevent renegotiation, and the client is not configured to prevent renegotiation. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the TLS connection.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a TLS renegotiation attack because the server is not configured to prevent renegotiation. The server is created with the `unref()` method, which allows the server to continue running even after the parent process exits. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the TLS connection. Additionally, the client is not configured to prevent renegotiation, which can also allow an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the TLS connection.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the server should be configured to prevent renegotiation by setting the `renegotiate` option to `false` when creating the server. Additionally, the client should be configured to prevent renegotiation by setting the `renegotiate` option to `false` when connecting to the server. This can be done by adding the following code to the server and client creation: `server = tls.createServer({ key, cert
