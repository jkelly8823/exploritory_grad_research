 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `continue` statement in a loop. This can cause the loop to skip certain iterations, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one. However, in this case, it is used to skip the iteration when `i === 3`. This can cause the loop to skip certain iterations, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. A potential attacker could exploit this by manipulating the value of `i` to cause the loop to skip certain iterations, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `continue` statement should be removed or replaced with a more secure alternative. The loop should be designed to handle all iterations correctly, without skipping any. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that there are no other potential security issues. The `fixtures.readSync` function should also be reviewed to ensure that it is secure and does not pose any security risks.
