VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of ArrayPrototypeSome() and ArrayPrototypeIncludes() methods without proper validation of the input arrays. This can lead to a catastrophic failure if the input arrays are very large, causing the program to consume excessive memory and CPU resources.
EXPLANATION: The ArrayPrototypeSome() and ArrayPrototypeIncludes() methods iterate over the entire input array, which can be a performance bottleneck if the array is large. In this code, the input arrays dnsNames and uriNames are not validated for size before being passed to these methods. If an attacker can manipulate the input to create very large arrays, it can lead to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the size of the input arrays before passing them to ArrayPrototypeSome() and ArrayPrototypeIncludes() methods. This can be done by adding a simple check to ensure that the array length is within a reasonable limit. Additionally, consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms that can handle large inputs without causing performance issues. For example, using a Set data structure to store
