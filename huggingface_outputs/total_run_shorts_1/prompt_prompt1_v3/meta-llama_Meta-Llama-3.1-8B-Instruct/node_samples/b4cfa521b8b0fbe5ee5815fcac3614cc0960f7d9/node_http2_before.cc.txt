VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The `session_` pointer is set to `nullptr` after it is used to call `RemoveStream(this)`, but before it is used to call `IsAvailableSessionMemory(length)`. This can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `session_` pointer is set to `nullptr` after it is used to call `RemoveStream(this)`, but before it is used to call `IsAvailableSessionMemory(length)`. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability. The `session_` pointer is being used after it has been freed, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `session_` pointer should be checked for `nullptr` before it is used to call `IsAvailableSessionMemory(length)`. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the call. For example: `if (session_!= nullptr) {... }`. Additionally, the `session_` pointer should be set to `nullptr` after it is used to call `RemoveStream
