VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system that is managing file system permissions. The code is creating a permission object with a 'FileSystemWrite' permission and a resource path. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure.  However, it would be beneficial to ensure that the 'path.toNamespacedPath' function is properly sanitized to prevent any potential path traversal attacks. This could be done by using a library that properly sanitizes paths, such as 'path.posix.join'.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to ensure that the 'blockedFile' variable is properly validated to prevent any potential attacks. This could be done by using a library that properly validates file paths, such as 'path.posix.normalize'.  However, these are not vulnerabilities in the code snippet provided, but rather potential security considerations.  The code snippet itself appears to be secure.  It is worth noting that the 'FileSystemWrite' permission is a legitimate permission and is not a vulnerability in and
