VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the `options.rejectUnauthorized` parameter. An attacker could potentially send a malicious `options` object with a large value for `rejectUnauthorized`, causing the `destroy` method to be called repeatedly, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The `options.rejectUnauthorized` parameter is not validated before being used to determine whether to call the `destroy` method. If an attacker can control the value of this parameter, they could potentially cause the `destroy` method to be called repeatedly, leading to a denial of service. This is a classic example of a DoS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `options.rejectUnauthorized` parameter to ensure it is within a reasonable range. This could be done by adding a simple check, such as `if (options.rejectUnauthorized > 0) {... }`. Additionally, the `destroy` method should be called with a timeout to prevent it from being called repeatedly. This could be done by using a `setTimeout` function to delay the call to
