VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack due to the lack of proper certificate verification. This is because the `rejectUnauthorized` option is set to `undefined`, which means that the server's certificate will not be verified.
EXPLANATION: When the `rejectUnauthorized` option is set to `undefined`, the TLS connection will not perform any certificate verification. This allows an attacker to intercept the connection and present a fake certificate, which can lead to a MITM attack. In this code, the `rejectUnauthorizedUndefined` function is called when an error occurs, and it sets the `rejectUnauthorized` option to `undefined` for the TLS connection. This means that the server's certificate will not be verified, making the connection vulnerable to a MITM attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `rejectUnauthorized` option should be set to `true` or `false` explicitly, depending on the requirements of the application. If the application requires certificate verification, `rejectUnauthorized` should be set to `true`. If the application does not require certificate verification, `rejectUnauthorized` should be be set to `
