VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition due to the use of the `once` method on the `tlssock` object. The `once` method is not thread-safe and can lead to unexpected behavior if multiple threads or callbacks are accessing the `tlssock` object simultaneously.
EXPLANATION: The `once` method is used to attach a callback to the `secureConnect` event of the `tlssock` object. However, if multiple threads or callbacks are accessing the `tlssock` object simultaneously, the `once` method can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the callback being attached multiple times or not being attached at all. This can cause the code to behave erratically or crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a thread-safe method to attach the callback to the `secureConnect` event, such as using a lock or a queue to ensure that only one callback is attached at a time. Alternatively, the code can use a different approach, such as using a promise or an async/await pattern, to ensure that the callback is attached in a thread-safe manner. Additionally, the code should be
