VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The socket.on('error') event listener does not properly handle the error. It calls the authorized function regardless of the error type, which could lead to unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The socket.on('error') event listener is supposed to handle any errors that occur on the socket. However, in this case, it calls the authorized function regardless of the error type. This could lead to unintended behavior, such as allowing unauthorized access to the server. A proper error handler should handle the error and prevent further execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The socket.on('error') event listener should be modified to properly handle the error. This can be done by checking the error type and handling it accordingly. For example, if the error is an authentication error, the authorized function should be called. If the error is a network error, the socket should be closed and the connection should be terminated. The modified code should look like this: socket.on('error', common.mustCall(function(err) { if (err instanceof Error) { // handle error } else { // handle network error } }));.
