VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to an HTTP/2 protocol frame error, where the peer has exceeded the limit of acceptable invalid frames.
EXPLANATION: The code is checking if the limit of acceptable invalid HTTP/2 protocol frames has been exceeded, indicating a potential issue with the peer's protocol frame handling.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the `maxSessionInvalidFrames` option should be adjusted to a higher value or the peer's protocol frame handling should be reviewed to prevent excessive invalid frames. Additionally, error handling and logging mechanisms should be implemented to provide more detailed information about the error.  The `REPLACEME` placeholder suggests that the developer should replace it with a valid value.  This value should be set to a reasonable limit based on the application's requirements.
