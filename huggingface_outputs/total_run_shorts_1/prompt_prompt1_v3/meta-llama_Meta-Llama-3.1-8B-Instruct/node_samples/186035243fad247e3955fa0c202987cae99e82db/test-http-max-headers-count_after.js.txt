VULNERABLE_LINES: 17, 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of user-controlled input in the `maxAndExpected` array. The `requests` variable is not defined, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access when accessing `maxAndExpected[requests]`.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of user-controlled input in the `maxAndExpected` array. The `requests` variable is not defined, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access when accessing `maxAndExpected[requests]`. This could potentially allow an attacker to access or modify sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, define the `requests` variable before using it to access the `maxAndExpected` array. Additionally, consider validating the input to ensure it is within the expected range. The corrected code should look like this: `let requests = 0; let max = maxAndExpected[requests][0]; let expected = maxAndExpected[requests][1];`. Note that this is just one possible fix, and the actual solution may depend on the specific requirements of the code.  ```javascript
