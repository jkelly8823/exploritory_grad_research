VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of a user-controlled variable (`requests`) in an array index. This can lead to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The variable `requests` is used as an index for the `maxAndExpected` array without any bounds checking. If `requests` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, it will result in an out-of-bounds error. This can be exploited by an attacker to access or modify sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking for the `requests` variable before using it as an index for the `maxAndExpected` array. For example: `if (requests >= 0 && requests < maxAndExpected.length) {... }`. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a Map, to store the key-value pairs. This will prevent similar issues in the future.  VULNERABLE: YES
