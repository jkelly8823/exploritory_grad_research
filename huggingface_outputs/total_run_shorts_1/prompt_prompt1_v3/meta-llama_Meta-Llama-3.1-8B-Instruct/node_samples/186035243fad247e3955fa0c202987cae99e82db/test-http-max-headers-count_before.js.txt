VULNERABLE_LINES: 17, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of a variable'requests' that is not defined within the given code snippet. This variable is used to index into the'maxAndExpected' array, but its value is not validated or checked for existence.
EXPLANATION: The variable'requests' is used to access the'maxAndExpected' array, but its value is not validated or checked for existence. This can lead to an 'undefined' error when trying to access the array with an undefined index. Additionally, the use of an undefined variable can make the code harder to understand and debug.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the variable'requests' should be defined and validated before using it to index into the'maxAndExpected' array. This can be done by checking if'requests' is within the valid range of indices for the'maxAndExpected' array. For example: if (requests >= 0 && requests < maxAndExpected.length) {... } else {... }. Alternatively, the variable'requests' can be initialized with a default value or a specific value that is known to be valid.
