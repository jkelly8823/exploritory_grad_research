VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to the inconsistent HTTP_PARSER_STRICT flag settings across different platforms.
EXPLANATION: The HTTP_PARSER_STRICT flag is used to control the strictness of HTTP parsing. When set to 0, the parser is less strict and may allow HTTP request smuggling attacks. However, in this code, the flag is set to 0 on non-Windows platforms and 1 on Windows platforms. This inconsistency can lead to HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the HTTP_PARSER_STRICT flag is consistently set across all platforms. This can be achieved by setting the flag to 1 on all platforms, or by using a more robust HTTP parsing library that is not vulnerable to request smuggling attacks. Additionally, consider using a more secure HTTP parser that is designed to prevent request smuggling attacks.  The flag should be set to 1 on all platforms to ensure consistent behavior and prevent potential vulnerabilities.  This can be done by changing the 'defines' flag to 'HTTP_PARSER_STRICT=1' in the'msvs_settings' section for non-Windows platforms.  This will ensure that
