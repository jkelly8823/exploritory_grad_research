VULNERABLE_LINES: 17, 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of user-controlled input in the `maxAndExpected` array. The `requests` and `responses` variables are not validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the values and potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The `maxAndExpected` array is used to store values that are used to determine the maximum and expected values for the server and client. However, the `requests` and `responses` variables are not validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate the values and potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or other security issues. This is a classic example of a "user-controlled input" vulnerability, where an attacker can inject malicious data into the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the `requests` and `responses` variables to ensure they are within a valid range. You can use a simple check to ensure that the values are within the bounds of the `maxAndExpected` array. For example, you can add a check to ensure that `requests` and `responses` are within the
