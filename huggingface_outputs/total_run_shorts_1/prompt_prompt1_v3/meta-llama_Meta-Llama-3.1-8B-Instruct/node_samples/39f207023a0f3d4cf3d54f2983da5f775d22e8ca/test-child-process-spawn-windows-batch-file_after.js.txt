VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The `cp.exec` function is being used with a user-supplied filename, which can lead to arbitrary command execution.
EXPLANATION: The `cp.exec` function is being used with a user-supplied filename, which can lead to arbitrary command execution. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability. The `suffixes` variable is used to filter the filename, but it does not prevent the execution of arbitrary commands. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the filename.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer alternative to `cp.exec`, such as `cp.execFile` or `child_process.execFile`. These functions allow for more fine-grained control over the command execution and can help prevent command injection attacks. Additionally, consider validating and sanitizing the user-supplied filename to prevent any malicious input. It's also a good practice to use a whitelist approach to allow only specific commands to be executed.  Also, consider using a library like `shell-quote` to properly quote the command arguments.  It's also a good practice to use a library like
