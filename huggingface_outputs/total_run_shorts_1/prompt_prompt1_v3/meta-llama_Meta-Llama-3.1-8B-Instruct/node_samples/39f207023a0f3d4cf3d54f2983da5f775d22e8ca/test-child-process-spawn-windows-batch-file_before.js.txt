VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of the 'exec' function with a user-supplied filename. This allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary system commands.
EXPLANATION: The 'exec' function is used to execute a system command. However, it does not perform any validation on the input filename. This means that an attacker could potentially supply a filename that contains directory traversal characters (e.g., '../'), allowing them to access and execute arbitrary files on the system. This is a serious security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer alternative to 'exec', such as 'child_process.execSync' or 'child_process.execFile'. These functions provide more control over the execution of system commands and can help prevent path traversal attacks. Additionally, consider validating the input filename to ensure it does not contain any directory traversal characters. For example, you could use a regular expression to check if the filename contains any of the following characters: '../', './', or '/'. If it does, you could reject the filename or take other appropriate action.  Also, consider using a whitelist approach to only allow
