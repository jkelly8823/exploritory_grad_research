VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regex denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the regex pattern is not anchored and can match any characters before the last dot in the filename, potentially leading to a catastrophic backtracking scenario.
EXPLANATION: The regex pattern R"(\.([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\s*[\.\s]*$)" is not anchored, which means it can match any characters before the last dot in the filename. This can lead to a catastrophic backtracking scenario if the filename contains a large number of characters before the last dot. The regex engine will try to match the pattern against each character, leading to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regex pattern should be anchored to the end of the string using the "$" symbol. The corrected regex pattern should be R"(\.([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\s*[\.\s]*$)". Additionally, the regex engine should be configured to use the "std::regex_constants::ECMAScript" flag to enable Unicode support and prevent the regex engine from matching Unicode characters that are
