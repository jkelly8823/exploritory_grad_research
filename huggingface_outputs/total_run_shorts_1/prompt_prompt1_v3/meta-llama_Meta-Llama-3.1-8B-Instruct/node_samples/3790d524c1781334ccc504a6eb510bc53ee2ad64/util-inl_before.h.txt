VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of strrchr() function without proper validation of the input string.
EXPLANATION: The strrchr() function is used to find the last occurrence of a character in a string. However, if the input string is crafted in a specific way, it can lead to a path traversal attack. This is because strrchr() does not perform any validation on the input string, and can return a pointer to a location within the string that is not a valid file extension. In this case, the code is checking if the last character of the filename is a dot, and if so, it checks if the string is equal to ".bat" or ".cmd". However, an attacker could craft a filename that ends with a dot, followed by a directory separator, and then a valid file extension, which would allow them to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input string before passing it to strrchr(). This can be done by checking if the input string is a valid file path, and if it does not contain any directory
