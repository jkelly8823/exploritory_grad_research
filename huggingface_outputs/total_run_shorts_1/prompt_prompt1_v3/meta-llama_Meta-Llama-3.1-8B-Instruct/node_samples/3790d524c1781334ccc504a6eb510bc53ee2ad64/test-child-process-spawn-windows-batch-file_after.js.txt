VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `cp.exec` function without proper error handling. This function can be used to execute arbitrary shell commands, which can lead to a DoS attack if the command is malicious.
EXPLANATION: The `cp.exec` function is used to execute a command in a new shell. However, if the command is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious code that can lead to a DoS attack. In this case, the `filename` parameter is not validated, which means that an attacker can pass a malicious filename that can execute arbitrary shell commands. The `common.mustCall` function is used to ensure that the `exit` event is emitted, but it does not provide any protection against a DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the `filename` parameter to prevent malicious filenames from being executed. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed filenames or by using a library that provides safe execution of shell commands. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle errors properly, such
