 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. This is because the `cp.exec` function is being called with a user-controlled argument (`filename`), which is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the `filename` argument.
EXPLANATION: The `cp.exec` function is a built-in Node.js function that executes a command in a shell. However, it does not perform any sanitization on the command string, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks. In this code, the `filename` argument is not validated or sanitized before being passed to `cp.exec`, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `filename` argument should be validated and sanitized before being passed to `cp.exec`. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed file extensions or by using a library that performs sanitization, such as `path` or `fs`. Additionally, the `cp.exec` function should be replaced with a safer alternative, such as `child_process.execFile`, which does not execute commands in a shell. ```javascript
function testExec(filename) {
  return new Promise
