 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple conditional check for Windows-specific file extensions. It uses a constexpr variable to determine the platform and then checks for specific file extensions using the strrchr function. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is always a good practice to consider using more modern and secure ways to determine the file extension, such as using the path extension function from the filesystem library. Additionally, the use of constexpr variables can be beneficial for performance and code readability.  ```bash
