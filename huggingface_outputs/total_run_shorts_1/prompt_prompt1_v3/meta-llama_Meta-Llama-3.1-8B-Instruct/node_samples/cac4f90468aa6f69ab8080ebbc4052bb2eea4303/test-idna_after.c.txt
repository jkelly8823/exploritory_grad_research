VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the uv__utf8_decode1 function.
EXPLANATION: The function uv__utf8_decode1 does not check the bounds of the input buffer before writing to it. This allows an attacker to write past the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the uv__utf8_decode1 function to prevent writing past the end of the buffer. This can be done by checking the length of the input buffer before writing to it. For example: if (p - b > len) { /* handle error */ } where len is the length of the input buffer. Additionally, consider using a safer function like uv__utf8_decode1_sized to handle the decoding.  The function uv__utf8_decode1_sized takes an additional parameter for the maximum number of bytes to write, which can help prevent buffer overflows.  The function uv__utf8_decode1_sized should be used instead of uv__utf8_decode1.  The function uv__utf8_decode1 should be deprecated and removed in a future version.  The function uv__utf8_decode
