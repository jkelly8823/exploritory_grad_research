VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The fs.rename function is asynchronous, but the assertion is synchronous. This means that the assertion may be executed before the rename operation has completed, potentially causing the assertion to fail even if the rename operation is successful.
EXPLANATION: The fs.rename function is asynchronous, which means that it does not block the execution of the code until the operation is complete. However, the assertion is synchronous, which means that it will be executed immediately. This can cause the assertion to fail even if the rename operation is successful, because the assertion is checking the state of the file system before the rename operation has completed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use an asynchronous assertion, such as assert.async.throws, or you should use a callback to ensure that the assertion is executed after the rename operation has completed. For example: assert.async.throws(() => { fs.rename(blockedFile, 'newfile', () => { }); });. Alternatively, you can use a library like async-mocha to write asynchronous tests.  ```javascript
// fs.rename
assert.async.throws(() => {
  fs.rename
