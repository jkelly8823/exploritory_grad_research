 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation for the `url` parameter in the `https.get()` and `https.request()` functions.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if the `url` parameter is a valid URL before passing it to the `https.get()` and `https.request()` functions. This allows an attacker to pass a malicious URL that could cause the program to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add input validation for the `url` parameter to ensure it is a valid URL before passing it to the `https.get()` and `https.request()` functions. You can use a library like `url` to validate the URL. For example: `const url = require('url'); if (!url.parse(url).hostname) { // handle invalid URL }`. Additionally, consider using a secure way to handle user input, such as using a whitelist of allowed URLs. ```javascript
const https = require('https');
const url = require('url');

function makeRequest(url) {
