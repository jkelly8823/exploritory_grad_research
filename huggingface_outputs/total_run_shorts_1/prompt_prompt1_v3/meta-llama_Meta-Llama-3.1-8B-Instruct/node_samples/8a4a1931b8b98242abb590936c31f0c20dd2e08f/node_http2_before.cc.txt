VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `Write` is called with a single buffer, but it is not checked if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The function `Write` is called with a single buffer, but it is not checked if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the buffer. The function `Write` is called with a single buffer, but it is not checked if the buffer is large enough to hold the data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function `Write` should be modified to check if the buffer is large enough to hold the data before calling the `nghttp2_session_mem_recv` function. This can be done by checking the size of the buffer against the size of the data to be written. If the buffer is not large enough, an error should be returned. Additionally, the function `Write` should be modified to handle the case
