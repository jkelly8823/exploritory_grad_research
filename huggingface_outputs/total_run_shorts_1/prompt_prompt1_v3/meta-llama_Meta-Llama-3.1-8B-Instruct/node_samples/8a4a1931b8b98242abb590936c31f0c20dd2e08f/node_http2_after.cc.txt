 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `nghttp2_session_mem_recv` function is called with a buffer that is not checked for null before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is null.
EXPLANATION: The `nghttp2_session_mem_recv` function is called with a buffer that is not checked for null before being used. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is null. The `CHECK_NOT_NULL(stream_buf_.base)` check earlier in the function does not guarantee that the buffer is not null, as the buffer could have been set to null after the check. To fix this vulnerability, the code should check for null before calling `nghttp2_session_mem_recv`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check for null before calling `nghttp2_session_mem_recv`. This can be done by adding a check before the call to `nghttp2_session_mem_recv` to ensure that the buffer is not null. For example: `if (stream_buf_.base!= nullptr) {... }`. This will prevent the buffer overflow attack. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer
