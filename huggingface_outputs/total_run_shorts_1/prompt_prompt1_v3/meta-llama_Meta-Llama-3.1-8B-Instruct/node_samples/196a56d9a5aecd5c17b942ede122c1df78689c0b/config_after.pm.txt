VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `die` function with a string that contains a variable reference (`$arch`). This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior if the variable is not defined or contains a null value.
EXPLANATION: The `die` function is used to terminate the program and print an error message. However, in this case, the error message contains a variable reference (`$arch`) that is not guaranteed to be defined or contain a valid value. If the variable is not defined or contains a null value, the `die` function will attempt to print a string that contains a null character, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the variable reference is properly checked for existence and validity before being used in the error message. This can be achieved by using a conditional statement to check if the variable is defined and contains a valid value before using it in the error message. For example: `die "ERROR I do not know how to handle ${arch}" if defined $
