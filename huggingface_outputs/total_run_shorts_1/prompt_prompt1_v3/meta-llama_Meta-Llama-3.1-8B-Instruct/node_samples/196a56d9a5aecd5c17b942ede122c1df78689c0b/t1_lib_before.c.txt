 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the lack of error handling in the OpenSSL EVP_DecryptUpdate function. If the function fails, the allocated memory for sdec is not freed, leading to a memory leak.
EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory for sdec using OPENSSL_malloc, but it does not check the return value of EVP_DecryptUpdate. If EVP_DecryptUpdate fails, the allocated memory for sdec is not freed, resulting in a memory leak. This is a critical vulnerability that can lead to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of EVP_DecryptUpdate and free the allocated memory for sdec if the function fails. The corrected code should look like this: if (EVP_DecryptUpdate(ctx, sdec, &slen, p, (int)eticklen) <= 0) { OPENSSL_free(sdec); sdec = NULL; } This ensures that the allocated memory is freed in case of an error, preventing a memory leak.  ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
