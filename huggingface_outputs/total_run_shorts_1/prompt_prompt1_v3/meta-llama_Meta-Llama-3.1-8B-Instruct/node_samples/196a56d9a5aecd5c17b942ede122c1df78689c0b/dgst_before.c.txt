VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the EVP_sha256() function without checking the length of the input data.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_sha256() function is used to create a new SHA-256 message digest context. However, this function does not check the length of the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow attack if the input data is too large. This is a potential security vulnerability because an attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a large input that overflows the buffer, leading to a crash or potentially even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input data before calling EVP_sha256(). This can be done by using the EVP_sha256() function with the EVP_sha256() function's length parameter, like this: EVP_sha256(NULL, 0). This will ensure that the function does not overflow the buffer and will prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the code should also check the return value of EVP_sha256() to ensure that it was successful.
