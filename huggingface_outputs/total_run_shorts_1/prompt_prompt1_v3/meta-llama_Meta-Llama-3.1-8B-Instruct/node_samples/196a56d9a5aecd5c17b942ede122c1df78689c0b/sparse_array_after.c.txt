VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. This occurs when the function ossl_sa_free_leaves() is called after ossl_sa_free() has freed the memory of the OPENSSL_SA object.
EXPLANATION: The function ossl_sa_free_leaves() is called after ossl_sa_free() has freed the memory of the OPENSSL_SA object. This is problematic because ossl_sa_free_leaves() likely still holds a reference to the freed memory, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This type of vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function ossl_sa_free_leaves() should be called before ossl_sa_free() is called. Alternatively, the function ossl_sa_free_leaves() should be modified to release its reference to the OPENSSL_SA object before ossl_sa_free() is called. This can be achieved by adding a check to see if the OPENSSL_SA object has already been freed before calling ossl_sa_free_leaves(). If it has, then ossl_sa_free_leaves() should not be
