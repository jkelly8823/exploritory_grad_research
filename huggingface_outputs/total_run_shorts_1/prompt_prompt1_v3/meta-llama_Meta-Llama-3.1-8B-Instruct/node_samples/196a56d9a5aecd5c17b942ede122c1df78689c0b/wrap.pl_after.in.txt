VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The vulnerability is due to the use of the `join` function to concatenate the command and its arguments, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the `@cmd` array.
EXPLANATION: The `join` function is used to concatenate the elements of the `@cmd` array into a single string, which is then used as a command. However, if an attacker can manipulate the `@cmd` array to include malicious code, it can be executed as part of the command. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to construct the command, such as using a library like `IPC::Open3` or `Capture::Tiny` that can safely execute commands and capture their output. Alternatively, the code can use a whitelist approach to validate the elements of the `@cmd` array to ensure they only contain safe characters. Additionally, the code should consider using a more secure way to handle signals, such as using a signal handler function.  The use of `die` is also
