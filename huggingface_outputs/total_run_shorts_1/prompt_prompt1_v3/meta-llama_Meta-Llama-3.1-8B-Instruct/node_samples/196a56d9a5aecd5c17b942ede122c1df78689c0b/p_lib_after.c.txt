VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. This is because the function `EVP_PKEY_is_a` does not check if `pkey->keymgmt` is null before calling `EVP_KEYMGMT_is_a` on it. Additionally, the function `EVP_PKEY_type_names_do_all` does not check if `pkey` is null before calling `evp_pkey_is_provided` on it.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided contains two functions, `EVP_PKEY_is_a` and `EVP_PKEY_type_names_do_all`. In the function `EVP_PKEY_is_a`, the code checks if `pkey` is null before proceeding, but it does not check if `pkey->keymgmt` is null before calling `EVP_KEYMGMT_is_a` on it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if `pkey->keymgmt` is null. Similarly, in the function `EVP_PKEY_type_names_do_all`, the code checks if `pkey` is null before proceeding, but it does not check if
