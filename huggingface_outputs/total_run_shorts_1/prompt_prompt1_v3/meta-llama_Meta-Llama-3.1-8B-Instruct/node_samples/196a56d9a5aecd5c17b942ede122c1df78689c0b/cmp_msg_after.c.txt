VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The variable 'rkey' is assigned a value and then immediately used, but it is not guaranteed that the assignment has completed before the use.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the assignment of 'rkey' is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. In a multi-threaded environment, it is possible that the assignment has not completed before the use, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the assignment of 'rkey' should be made thread-safe. This can be achieved by using a lock or by ensuring that the assignment is completed before the use. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all assignments are thread-safe.
