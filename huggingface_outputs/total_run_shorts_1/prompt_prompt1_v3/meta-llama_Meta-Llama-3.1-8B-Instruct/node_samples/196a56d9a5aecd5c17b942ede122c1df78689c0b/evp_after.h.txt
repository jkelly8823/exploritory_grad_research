VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro. The macro is defined as ((size_t)1 << 30), which is a large value that can cause a buffer overflow when used in certain contexts.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_MAXCHUNK macro is used to define the maximum chunk size for certain cryptographic operations. However, the value of 1 << 30 is extremely large and can cause a buffer overflow when used in certain contexts. This can lead to a security vulnerability, as an attacker may be able to manipulate the buffer size to cause a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro should be reduced to a more reasonable value, such as ((size_t)1 << 20). This will prevent buffer overflows and ensure the security of the cryptographic operations. Additionally, it is recommended to use a safer method to calculate the maximum chunk size, such as using a fixed-size buffer or a dynamically allocated buffer with bounds checking.  The buffer overflow is not directly in the code snippet, but the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro is used in other parts of the codebase, and its
