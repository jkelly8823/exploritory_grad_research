VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `...` syntax in the `app_bail_out` function. This allows an attacker to pass a variable number of arguments, which can lead to a buffer overflow if not properly handled.
EXPLANATION: The `app_bail_out` function uses the `...` syntax to allow for a variable number of arguments. However, this can lead to a buffer overflow if the function is not properly implemented to handle the variable number of arguments. This is a potential security vulnerability as an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `app_bail_out` function should be modified to use a safer alternative, such as a `va_list` to handle the variable number of arguments. Additionally, the function should be implemented to properly check the bounds of the buffer to prevent a buffer overflow. This can be achieved by using a function like `vsnprintf` to safely print the formatted string. ```c
void app_bail_out(char *fmt, va_list args) {
    vsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), fmt,
