VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for potential buffer overflows when setting the output length for XOF algorithms.
EXPLANATION: The code does not perform any checks on the value of the xoflen option, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker were to provide a large value for this option. This could result in a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the value of the xoflen option to ensure it is within a valid range before setting it. This could be done by adding a simple check to ensure the value is not greater than a certain maximum value. For example: if (xoflen > MAX_XOFLEN) { handle_error(); } where MAX_XOFLEN is a constant representing the maximum allowed value for xoflen.  Additionally, the code should consider using a safer data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the xoflen value to prevent potential overflows.  The code should also consider adding a check to ensure the xoflen value is a positive integer.  Finally, the code should consider documenting the valid range of values for the xoflen option to help
