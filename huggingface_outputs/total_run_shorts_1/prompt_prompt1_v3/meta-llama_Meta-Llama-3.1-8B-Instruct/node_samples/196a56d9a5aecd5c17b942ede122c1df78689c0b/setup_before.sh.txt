 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of hardcoded paths and file names. This can lead to issues if the script is run on a different system or if the file paths are changed.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses hardcoded paths and file names, such as "./mkcert.sh" and "root-cert.pem". This can cause problems if the script is run on a different system or if the file paths are changed. It would be better to use environment variables or configurable paths to make the script more flexible and robust.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using environment variables or configurable paths to specify the file names and paths. For example, you can use the "MKCERT_SH" environment variable to specify the path to the "mkcert.sh" script. Additionally, consider using a configuration file to store the file names and paths, and load the configuration at runtime. This will make the script more flexible and easier to maintain.  ```bash
# cross root and root cross cert
export MKCERT_SH="./mkcert.sh"
$MKCERT_SH genroot "Cross Root" cross-key cross-root
export ROOT_CERT="
