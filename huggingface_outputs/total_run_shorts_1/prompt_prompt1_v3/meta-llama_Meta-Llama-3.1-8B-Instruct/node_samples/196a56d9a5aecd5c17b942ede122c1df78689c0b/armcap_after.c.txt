VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of sigaction and sigprocmask functions without proper error handling.
EXPLANATION: The sigaction and sigprocmask functions can fail and return an error code, but the code does not check for these errors. If an error occurs, the program may enter an undefined state, leading to a potential DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check the return values of sigaction and sigprocmask and handle any errors that may occur. This can be done by checking the return values and taking appropriate action, such as logging the error or exiting the program. For example:
```c
if (sigaction(SIGILL, &ill_oact, NULL)!= 0) {
    // handle error
}
if (sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oset, NULL)!= 0) {
    // handle error
}
