VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (buf) to store the contents of the file. An attacker could potentially craft a file that exceeds the size of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a fixed-size buffer (buf) to store the contents of the file. However, the size of the buffer is not dynamically adjusted based on the size of the file. This makes it vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack. An attacker could potentially craft a file that exceeds the size of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a dynamically-sized buffer or a buffer that can handle the maximum expected size of the file. This can be achieved by using a buffer that is dynamically allocated based on the size of the file, or by using a library that provides a buffer that can handle large amounts of data. Additionally
