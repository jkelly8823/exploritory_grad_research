 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in this code. The function SSL_SESSION_list_add(ctx, c) is called before the lock is released, which could lead to a race condition if another thread is trying to access the session list while the lock is still held.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using a lock to protect access to the session cache, but the lock is not being held for the duration of the entire critical section. The function SSL_SESSION_list_add(ctx, c) is called before the lock is released, which means that another thread could potentially access the session list while the lock is still held, leading to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lock should be held for the duration of the entire critical section. This can be achieved by moving the CRYPTO_THREAD_unlock(ctx->lock) call to after the SSL_SESSION_list_add(ctx, c) call. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all access to the session cache is properly synchronized.
