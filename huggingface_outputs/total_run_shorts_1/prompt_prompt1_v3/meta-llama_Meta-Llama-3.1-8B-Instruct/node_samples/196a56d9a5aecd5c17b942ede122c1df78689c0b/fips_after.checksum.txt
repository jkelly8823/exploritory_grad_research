VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate user input from the SQL code. This can be achieved by using a library like `sqlite3` in Python, which supports parameterized queries. For example: `cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name =?", (username,))`. This ensures that user input is treated as a parameter, rather than part of the SQL code. Additionally, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract away the underlying SQL and reduce the risk of SQL injection. 

Note: The code snippet is a simple Python script that takes a username as input and queries a SQLite database to retrieve the user's information. The vulnerable line is the one that directly concatenates the user input into the SQL query. 

```python
import sqlite3

username = input("Enter your username: ")

conn = sqlite3.connect("users.db")
cursor = conn
