 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double-free vulnerability. The code attempts to free memory twice in the same context, which can lead to a double-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The double-free vulnerability occurs in the following lines: `memset(ctx, 0, sizeof(*ctx));` is called twice in the same function. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially cause a crash or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the second call to `memset(ctx, 0, sizeof(*ctx));` to prevent the double-free vulnerability. The first call to `memset` is sufficient to clear the memory. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to clear memory, such as `OPENSSL_clear_free`. 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use-after-free vulnerability. The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
EXPLANATION: The use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the following line: `ENGINE_finish(ctx->engine);`. The `ctx->engine` pointer is freed earlier in the function, but the code still attempts to access it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove
