VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the lack of BN_free() call before BN_clear_free() call.
EXPLANATION: BN_clear_free() is used to free the memory allocated by BN_new() or BN_bin2bn(). However, in this code, BN_clear_free() is called without freeing the memory allocated by BN_new() or BN_bin2bn(). This can lead to a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The BN_free() call should be added before the BN_clear_free() call to free the memory allocated by BN_new() or BN_bin2bn(). The corrected code should look like this: BN_free(bn_priv); BN_clear_free(bn_priv);.
