VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability in BIO_ctrl_pending and BIO_ctrl_wpending functions.
EXPLANATION: The functions BIO_ctrl_pending and BIO_ctrl_wpending cast the return value of BIO_ctrl to size_t, which can lead to an integer overflow if the return value is larger than SIZE_MAX. This can result in a buffer overflow or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the functions should be modified to handle the return value of BIO_ctrl without casting it to size_t. This can be done by checking the return value against SIZE_MAX before casting it. Alternatively, the functions can be modified to use a larger integer type, such as uint64_t, to handle larger values. Additionally, the functions should be reviewed to ensure that they are not vulnerable to other security issues. 

Note: The code snippet is from the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used cryptographic library. The vulnerability described above is a potential security issue that could be exploited by an attacker. It is essential to address this vulnerability to ensure the security of the library and its users.  Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
