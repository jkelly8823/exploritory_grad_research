VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential code injection attack due to the use of untrusted input in the construction of the %targets hash.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a hash to store configuration settings, but it is not validating or sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating the input to the hash. For example, an attacker could inject a malicious value for the "inherit_from" key, which could lead to code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize all input to the hash, using a whitelist of allowed values. This can be done using a regular expression or a separate validation function. Additionally, the code should consider using a more secure data structure, such as a JSON object, which can help prevent code injection attacks.  The code should also consider using a secure way to handle the "inherit_from" key, such as using a separate data structure to store the inheritance relationships.  The code should also consider using a secure way to handle the "CC" and "CFLAGS" keys, such as using a separate data structure to store the compiler flags.
