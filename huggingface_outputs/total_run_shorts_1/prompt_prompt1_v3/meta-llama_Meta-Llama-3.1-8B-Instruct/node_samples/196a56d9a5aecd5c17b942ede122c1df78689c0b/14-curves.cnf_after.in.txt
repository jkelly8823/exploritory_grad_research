VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a foreach loop with a hardcoded array index. This can lead to an out-of-bounds error if the array size changes.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a foreach loop to iterate over the elements of the $curves_tls_1_2 array. However, the loop uses a hardcoded array index ($#curves_tls_1_2) to determine the upper bound of the loop. This can lead to an out-of-bounds error if the array size changes, potentially causing a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a foreach loop with a variable that iterates over the array elements, rather than using a hardcoded array index. For example, use the following code: foreach my $curve (@$curves_tls_1_2) {... } This will ensure that the loop iterates over the correct number of elements, regardless of the array size. Additionally, consider using a more robust way to iterate over the array, such as using a for loop with a range or a while loop with
