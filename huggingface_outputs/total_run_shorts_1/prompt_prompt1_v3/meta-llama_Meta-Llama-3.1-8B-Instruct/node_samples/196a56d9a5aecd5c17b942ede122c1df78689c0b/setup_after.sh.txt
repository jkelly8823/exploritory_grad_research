VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the use of hardcoded paths and file names. This can lead to issues if the script is run in a different environment or if the file names are changed.
EXPLANATION: The code uses hardcoded paths and file names, such as "./mkcert.sh" and "root-cert.pem", which can make it difficult to maintain and update the script. If the script is run in a different environment or if the file names are changed, the script may fail or produce incorrect results. This can lead to security risks if the script is used to generate certificates or other sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this risk, the code should be modified to use environment variables or configuration files to store the paths and file names. This will make it easier to maintain and update the script, and reduce the risk of security issues. For example, the script could use the "MKCERT_SH" environment variable to specify the path to the "mkcert.sh" script, and the "ROOT_CERT_FILE" environment variable to specify the path to the "root-cert.pem" file. This will allow the script to be run in
