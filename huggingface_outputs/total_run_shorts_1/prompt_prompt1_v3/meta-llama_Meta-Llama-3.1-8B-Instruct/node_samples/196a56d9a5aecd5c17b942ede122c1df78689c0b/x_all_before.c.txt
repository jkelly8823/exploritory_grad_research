VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function X509_verify() does not properly check the signature of the certificate, which can lead to a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function X509_verify() compares the signature algorithm of the certificate with the signature algorithm of the certificate information. However, it does not check if the signature is valid. This can lead to a vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the signature of the certificate.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function X509_verify() should be modified to properly check the signature of the certificate. This can be done by calling the ASN1_item_verify_ex() function with the correct parameters. Additionally, the function should check if the signature is valid before returning 0.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function X509_sign() does not properly check the signature of the certificate, which can lead to a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function X509_sign() calls the ASN1_item_sign_ex() function to sign the certificate. However, it does not check if the signature is valid. This can lead to a vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the signature of the
