 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `ossl_method_store_free` function is called with a pointer to `store` that may have already been freed. This can occur when `ossl_method_store_free` is called recursively, or when `ossl_method_store_free` is called with a pointer to `store` that has already been freed by another thread.
EXPLANATION: The `ossl_method_store_free` function is called with a pointer to `store` that may have already been freed. This can occur when `ossl_method_store_free` is called recursively, or when `ossl_method_store_free` is called with a pointer to `store` that has already been freed by another thread. The `ossl_method_store_free` function does not check if the pointer to `store` is valid before attempting to free it. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `ossl_method_store_free` function should be modified to check if the pointer to `store` is valid before
