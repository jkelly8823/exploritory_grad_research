VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for potential buffer overflows when adding certificates or CRLs to the CMS structure.
EXPLANATION: The code does not perform any bounds checking on the size of the certificates or CRLs being added to the CMS structure. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if a large certificate or CRL is added.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the size of the certificates or CRLs being added to the CMS structure before adding them. This can be done by checking the size of the input parameters and ensuring they do not exceed the maximum allowed size for the CMS structure. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer function for adding certificates or CRLs, such as one that uses a buffer size parameter to prevent buffer overflows.  The code should also consider adding error checking to handle cases where the input parameters are invalid.
