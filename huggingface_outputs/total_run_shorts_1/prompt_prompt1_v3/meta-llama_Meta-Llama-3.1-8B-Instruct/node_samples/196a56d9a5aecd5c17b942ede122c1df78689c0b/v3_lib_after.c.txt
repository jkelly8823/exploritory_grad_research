VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The function sk_X509_EXTENSION_delete() may return NULL, but the code does not check for this condition before calling X509_EXTENSION_free(). If sk_X509_EXTENSION_delete() returns NULL, calling X509_EXTENSION_free() will result in a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is part of a function that appears to be handling X509 extensions. The function checks if the extension to be deleted is present in the extension list using sk_X509_EXTENSION_delete(). If the extension is found, it is deleted and the function returns 1. However, if the extension is not found, the function returns -1. The issue arises when the function returns -1, indicating that the extension was not found. In this case, the code does not check if the return value of sk_X509_EXTENSION_delete() is NULL before calling X509_EXTENSION_free(). If sk_X509_EXTENSION_delete() returns NULL, it means that the extension was not found, and calling X509_EXTENSION_free() will result in a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the return value
