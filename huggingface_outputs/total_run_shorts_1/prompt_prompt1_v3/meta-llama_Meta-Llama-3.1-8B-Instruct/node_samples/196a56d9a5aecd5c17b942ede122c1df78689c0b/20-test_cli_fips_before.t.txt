VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential command injection attack. The 'run' function is called with user-controlled input, which is then passed to the 'openssl' command without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The 'run' function is called with the output of 'app(['openssl', 'dgst', '-sha256', $testtext])', which includes the user-controlled input '$testtext'. This input is not sanitized or validated, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious commands. The 'openssl' command is executed with this input, which could lead to unintended behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'run' function should be called with sanitized and validated input. This can be achieved by using a library that properly sanitizes user input, such as 'Text::Sanitize'. Additionally, the 'openssl' command should be executed with a whitelist of allowed arguments to prevent command injection attacks. For example, 'app(['openssl', 'dgst', '-sha256', '-binary', $sanitized_input])' where '$sanitized_input' is the sanitized and validated input.  The 'run
