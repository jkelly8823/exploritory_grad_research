VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of the "mgf1-digest" algorithm, which is not secure against certain types of attacks.
EXPLANATION: The "mgf1-digest" algorithm is a type of message authentication code (MAC) that is vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as the "padding oracle attack". This attack allows an attacker to recover the plaintext message by manipulating the padding of the ciphertext. The use of the "mgf1-digest" algorithm in this code snippet makes it vulnerable to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more secure algorithm, such as the "HMAC" algorithm. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly configured to prevent the padding oracle attack. This may involve implementing additional security measures, such as padding validation and error handling.
