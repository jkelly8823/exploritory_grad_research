 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro. The macro is defined as 1 shifted left by the number of bits in a long integer minus 2. This can result in a very large value, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when used in a function that allocates memory based on this value.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_MAXCHUNK macro is used to define the maximum chunk size for a block cipher. However, the calculation used to determine this value is incorrect. The expression (sizeof(long)*8-2) will always evaluate to a large number, resulting in a very large value for EVP_MAXCHUNK. This can cause a buffer overflow when used in a function that allocates memory based on this value. For example, if a function allocates memory based on EVP_MAXCHUNK, it may allocate more memory than it needs, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the EVP_MAXCHUNK macro should be redefined to use a more reasonable value. For example, it could be defined as a fixed value, such as 1024, or it could be calculated based on
