 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a license header and a list of file names. It does not contain any executable code or potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It is a standard license header and file list.  The code appears to be well-structured and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.  However, it is always a good practice to review the code for any potential issues, especially when working with cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL.  Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that the file list is up-to-date and accurate to prevent any potential issues with file management.  Finally, it is recommended to consider using a more secure license, such as the Apache License 2.0, to ensure that the code is protected by a robust and widely-accepted open-source license.  However, these are general recommendations and not specific to this code snippet.  The code itself appears to be secure.  The code is a license header and a list of file names, and it does not contain any executable code or potential security vulnerabilities.
