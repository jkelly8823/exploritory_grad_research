 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a configuration file for a cryptographic protocol. It defines various parameters such as the shared secret, FIPS version, derivation method, peer key, and key derivation function. However, upon closer inspection, there are no obvious vulnerabilities present in this code snippet. The parameters defined seem to be standard and do not indicate any potential security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes. However, it is always a good practice to regularly review and update cryptographic configurations to ensure they remain secure.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger system, and its security depends on the overall design and implementation of that system.  It is also worth noting that the use of a hardcoded shared secret is generally considered a security risk, but in this case, it is not a vulnerability in the code itself.  It is a design choice that should be reviewed and potentially changed in a larger context.  The hardcoded secret is not a vulnerability in this code snippet, but it is a potential security risk
