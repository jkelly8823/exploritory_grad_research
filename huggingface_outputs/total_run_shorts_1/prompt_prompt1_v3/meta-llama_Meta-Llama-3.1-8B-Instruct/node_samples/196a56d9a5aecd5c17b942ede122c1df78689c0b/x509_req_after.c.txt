VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference when a null pointer is passed to the X509_REQ_delete_attr function.
EXPLANATION: The X509_REQ_delete_attr function does not check if the req pointer is null before calling the X509at_delete_attr function. If a null pointer is passed to this function, it will cause a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The X509_REQ_delete_attr function should be modified to check if the req pointer is null before calling the X509at_delete_attr function. If the req pointer is null, the function should return an error code instead of attempting to delete the attribute. The modified function should look like this: int X509_REQ_delete_attr(X509_REQ *req, int loc) { if (req == NULL) { ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_X509, ERR_R_PASSED_NULL_PARAMETER); return 0; } attr = X509at_delete_attr(req->req_info.attributes, loc
