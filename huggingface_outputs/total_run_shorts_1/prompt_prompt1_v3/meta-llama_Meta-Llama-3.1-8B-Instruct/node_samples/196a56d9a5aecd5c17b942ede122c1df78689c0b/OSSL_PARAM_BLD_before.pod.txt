VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the repeated use of the same OSSL_PARAM_BLD object (bld) without freeing it after the first use.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two instances where the OSSL_PARAM_BLD object (bld) is used to create an OSSL_PARAM array. However, after the first use, the object is not freed, leading to a potential memory leak. This is because the OSSL_PARAM_BLD object is not designed to be reused, and freeing it after the first use is necessary to prevent memory leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the OSSL_PARAM_BLD object (bld) should be freed after the first use, and a new object should be created for the second use. This can be achieved by adding the line "OSSL_PARAM_BLD_free(bld);" after the first use of the object. Additionally, a new OSSL_PARAM_BLD object should be created for the second use, like this: "OSSL_PARAM_BLD *bld2 = OSSL_PARAM_BLD_new();". This will ensure that the
