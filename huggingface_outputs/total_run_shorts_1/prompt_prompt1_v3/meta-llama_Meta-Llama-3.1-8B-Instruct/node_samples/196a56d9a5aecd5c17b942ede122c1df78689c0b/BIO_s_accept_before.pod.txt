VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of BIO_new_accept() with a hardcoded port number.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_new_accept() function is used to create a new accept BIO. However, the port number "4444" is hardcoded, which can lead to a buffer overflow attack if an attacker is able to manipulate the port number. This is a security risk because an attacker could potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the port number should be made dynamic and not hardcoded. This can be achieved by using a secure random number generator to generate a random port number. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all port numbers are properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential buffer overflow attacks.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of ERR_print_errors_fp() with a hardcoded file pointer.
EXPLANATION: The ERR_print_errors_fp() function is used to print error messages to a file pointer. However
