 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, possibly a cleanup function, given the presence of error handling and resource deallocation. The code is well-structured and follows a clear flow. The use of labels and goto statements is consistent with the OpenSSL coding style. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). However, it is worth noting that the code is quite complex and may benefit from additional review and testing to ensure its correctness.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and well-written. However, it may be beneficial to consider adding additional error handling and logging to improve the code's robustness and maintainability. Additionally, the use of goto statements can make the code more difficult to understand and debug, so it may be worth considering alternative approaches.  Please note that this code is part of a larger project and may have additional context that is not present in this snippet.  Further review of the entire project may be necessary to ensure the code is secure.
