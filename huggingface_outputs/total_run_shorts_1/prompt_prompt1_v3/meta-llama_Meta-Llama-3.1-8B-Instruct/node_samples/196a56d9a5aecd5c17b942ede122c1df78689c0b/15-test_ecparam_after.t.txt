 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `run` function without proper error handling. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities if the command executed by `run` fails.
EXPLANATION: The `run` function is used to execute external commands, but it does not provide any error handling or checking for the return status of the command. This means that if the command executed by `run` fails, the code will not be able to detect or handle the failure, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle the return status of the `run` function. This can be done by checking the return status of the command and taking appropriate action if it fails. For example, the code can be modified to use the `system` function with the `qx` operator to execute the command and capture its output, and then check the return status of the command using the `$?` variable. Additionally, the code can be modified to use a more secure way to execute external commands, such as using a library that provides secure command
