VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a changelog or migration guide for OpenSSL, detailing changes between different versions. It does not contain any executable code that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. The text describes a bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs, but this is a known issue and not a vulnerability in the code itself.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No code changes are necessary to address any vulnerabilities in this snippet. However, it is recommended to review the migration guide and ensure that any necessary updates are applied to the OpenSSL implementation to address the described bug.  This may involve updating the RSA implementation or ensuring that the AVX512IFMA instructions are not used on affected CPUs.  Consult the OpenSSL documentation and support resources for further guidance.  Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures to mitigate potential risks associated with the described bug.  This may include implementing fallbacks or workarounds for affected CPUs or ensuring that the RSA implementation is properly validated and tested.  Consult with a qualified security professional or OpenSSL expert to determine the best course of action.  It is also recommended to
