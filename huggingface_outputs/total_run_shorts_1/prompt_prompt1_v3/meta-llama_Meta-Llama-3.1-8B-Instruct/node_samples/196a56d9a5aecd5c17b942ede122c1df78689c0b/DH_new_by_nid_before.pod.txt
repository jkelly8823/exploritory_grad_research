 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a deprecated function call, which may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if used in a production environment.
EXPLANATION: The DH_get_nid() function has been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0 and can be hidden entirely by defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value. This indicates that the function is no longer supported and may cause issues if used in newer versions of OpenSSL.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value to hide the deprecated function call. Alternatively, consider replacing the deprecated function with a newer alternative or updating the code to use a version of OpenSSL that does not include this deprecated function.  ```c
#define OPENSSL_API_COMPAT 0x10100000L
```  This will hide the deprecated function call and prevent it from being used in newer versions of OpenSSL. ```c
```  Alternatively, you can replace the deprecated function call with a newer alternative, such as using the DH_get0_pqg() function to retrieve the prime and generator values. ```c
DH *dh = DH_new_by_nid(nid);
