VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed IV length for AES-128 encryption in TLS 1.2 and earlier.
EXPLANATION: In TLS 1.2 and earlier, the code uses a fixed IV length of EVP_GCM_TLS_FIXED_IV_LEN for AES-128 encryption. However, in TLS 1.3, the code uses the IV length obtained from EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(dd). This inconsistency can lead to a potential buffer overflow attack if an attacker can manipulate the IV length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the IV length obtained from EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(dd) for all versions of TLS, including TLS 1.2 and earlier. This can be achieved by removing the else clause and using the IV length obtained from EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(dd) for all cases. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator to generate the IV. 

Note: The code snippet is incomplete, but based on the provided context, it appears to be related to the OpenSSL project and involves encryption using AES-GCM. The vulnerability is
