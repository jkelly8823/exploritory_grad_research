VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function ossl_rand_get_entropy and ossl_rand_get_nonce do not properly handle the entropy and nonce generation. They return 0 without generating any entropy or nonce, which can lead to predictable and insecure random numbers.
EXPLANATION: The functions ossl_rand_get_entropy and ossl_rand_get_nonce are supposed to generate entropy and nonce respectively. However, they do not perform any actual entropy or nonce generation. They simply return 0, which means that the caller will not receive any entropy or nonce. This can lead to predictable and insecure random numbers, which can be exploited by attackers.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The functions ossl_rand_get_entropy and ossl_rand_get_nonce should be modified to properly generate entropy and nonce. This can be done by using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the entropy and nonce. The generated entropy and nonce should be stored in the pout parameter and the function should return the length of the generated entropy or nonce. Additionally, the functions should be modified to handle errors properly, such as checking the return value of the CSPRNG and handling any errors that may
