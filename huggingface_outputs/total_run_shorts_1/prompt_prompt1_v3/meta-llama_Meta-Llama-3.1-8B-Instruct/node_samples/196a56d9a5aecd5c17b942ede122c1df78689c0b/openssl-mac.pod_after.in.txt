VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability due to the lack of input validation for the filename parameter.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not validate the input filename, which can lead to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the filename to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate the input filename using a whitelist approach or a regular expression to ensure it only accepts expected file extensions and paths. Consider using a library like Path::Class to handle file paths securely. Additionally, consider using a secure method to read the file, such as using a file handle instead of reading the entire file into memory.  ```perl
use Path::Class;

my $filename = shift @ARGV;
if ($filename eq '-') {
    $filename = \*STDIN;
}

my $out_filename = shift @ARGV;
if ($out_filename eq '-') {
    $out_filename = \*STDOUT;
}

my $file = file($filename);
my $out = file($out_filename);
