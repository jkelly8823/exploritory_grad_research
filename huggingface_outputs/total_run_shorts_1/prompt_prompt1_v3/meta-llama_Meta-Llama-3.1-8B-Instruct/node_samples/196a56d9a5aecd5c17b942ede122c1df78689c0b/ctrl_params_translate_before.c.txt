VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the EVP_PKEY_CTRL_GET_MD control function without proper validation of the input parameters.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_CTRL_GET_MD control function is used to retrieve the message digest algorithm used for signature generation. However, the code snippet does not validate the input parameters, which can lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker provides a malicious input. This can result in arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input parameters before passing them to the EVP_PKEY_CTRL_GET_MD control function. This can be done by checking the length of the input string and ensuring it does not exceed the maximum allowed length. Additionally, the code should use a secure function to copy the input string to a buffer, such as strcpy_s or strncpy, to prevent buffer overflows. The code should also consider using a safer alternative to EVP_PKEY_CTRL_GET_MD, such as EVP_PKEY_CTX_get_md, which does not require input parameters.
