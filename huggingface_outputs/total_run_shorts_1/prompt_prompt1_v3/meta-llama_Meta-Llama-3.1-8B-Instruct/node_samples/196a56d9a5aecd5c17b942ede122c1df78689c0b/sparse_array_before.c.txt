 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The function ossl_sa_free_leaves() is called after ossl_sa_free() has freed the memory pointed to by the sa pointer.
RECOMMATION: The function ossl_sa_free_leaves() should be called before ossl_sa_free() to prevent the use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function ossl_sa_free() frees the memory pointed to by the sa pointer. However, the function ossl_sa_free_leaves() is called after ossl_sa_free() has freed the memory. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where the function ossl_sa_free_leaves() tries to access memory that has already been freed. To prevent this vulnerability, the function ossl_sa_free_leaves() should be called before ossl_sa_free().
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function ossl_sa_free_leaves() should be called before ossl_sa_free() to prevent the use-after-free vulnerability. This can be achieved by swapping the order of the function calls in the code. For example: ossl_sa_free_leaves(sa); ossl_sa_free(sa);. This
