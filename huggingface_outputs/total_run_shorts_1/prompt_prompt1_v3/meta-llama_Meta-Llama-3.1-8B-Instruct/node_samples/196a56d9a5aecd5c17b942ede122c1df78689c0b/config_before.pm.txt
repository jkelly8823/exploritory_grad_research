VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack due to the use of backticks (``) to execute system commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
EXPLANATION: The code uses backticks to execute system commands, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability. The code is using the `$CROSS_COMPILE$CC -v 2>&1` and `$CROSS_COMPILE$CC -dumpversion 2>/dev/null` commands to extract version information from the compiler, but an attacker could inject malicious commands by manipulating the `$CROSS_COMPILE` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to execute system commands, such as using the `IPC::Cmd` module or the `system` function with proper input validation. Additionally, the code should ensure that the `$CROSS_COMPILE` variable is properly sanitized to prevent any malicious input from being injected. The code should also consider using a more secure method to extract version information from the compiler, such as
