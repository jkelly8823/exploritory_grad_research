VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the sizeof operator on a variable of type char*. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the keybytes array is larger than the actual size of the array.
EXPLANATION: The sizeof operator returns the size of the keybytes array in bytes, which includes the null terminator. However, the ASN1_BIT_STRING_set function does not account for the null terminator, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the strlen function to get the actual size of the keybytes array, excluding the null terminator. The corrected code should be: ASN1_BIT_STRING_set(key, keybytes, strlen(keybytes)). This ensures that the buffer is not overflowed and the function call is safe.  Additionally, consider using a safer function like strlcpy to copy the keybytes array to a buffer, to prevent buffer overflows.
