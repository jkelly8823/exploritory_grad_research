VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow in the `tls_construct_new_session_ticket` function. The `tick_nonce` variable is declared as an array of size `TICKET_NONCE_SIZE`, but it is not checked for buffer overflow when assigning the result of `construct_stateless_ticket` to it. Additionally, the `age_add_u` variable is not checked for buffer overflow when assigning the result of `i2d_SSL_SESSION` to it.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow because it does not check the size of the data being assigned to the `tick_nonce` and `age_add_u` variables. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data being assigned is larger than the size of the variables. The `construct_stateless_ticket` function returns an integer value, but it does not check if the result is within the bounds of the `tick_nonce` variable. Similarly, the `i2d_SSL
