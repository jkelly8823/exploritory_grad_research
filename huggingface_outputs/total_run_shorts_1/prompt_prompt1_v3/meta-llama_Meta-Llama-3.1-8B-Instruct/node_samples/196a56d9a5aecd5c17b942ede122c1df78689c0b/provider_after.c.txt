VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function fips_provider_version_match() does not properly handle the case when the input string "versions" contains a version number that is not in the correct format. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the sscanf() function attempts to parse the version number.
EXPLANATION: The function fips_provider_version_match() uses the sscanf() function to parse the version number from the input string "versions". However, it does not check if the sscanf() function was successful in parsing the version number. If the input string contains a version number that is not in the correct format, the sscanf() function will return a value less than 3, indicating that not all the expected fields were successfully parsed. In this case, the function will attempt to access the fields that were not parsed, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function fips_provider_version_match() should check the return value of the sscanf() function to ensure that it was successful in parsing the version number. If the return value is less than 3, the function should return an error code to indicate that the input string is not in the correct format.
