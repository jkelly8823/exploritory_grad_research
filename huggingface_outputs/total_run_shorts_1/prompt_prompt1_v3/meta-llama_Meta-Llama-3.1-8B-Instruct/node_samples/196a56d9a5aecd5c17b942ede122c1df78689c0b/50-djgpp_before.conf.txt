VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential code injection attack due to the use of unquoted string values in a hash.
EXPLANATION: The use of unquoted string values in a hash can lead to code injection attacks if an attacker is able to manipulate the input data. In this case, the hash key "DJGPP" is not quoted, which means that if an attacker is able to inject malicious data into the hash, it could potentially be executed as code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use quoted string values for the hash keys. For example: my %targets = ( "DJGPP" => {... } );. This will prevent any malicious data from being executed as code. Additionally, it's recommended to use a secure way to populate the hash, such as using a whitelist of allowed values.  Also, consider using a more secure data structure, such as a blessed hash, to prevent code injection attacks.
