VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in this code. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_cb() does not check if the provided callback function is null before calling it. If a null callback function is passed to this function, it will attempt to call the null function, resulting in a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_cb() function is used to set the callback function for the EVP_PKEY_CTX structure. However, this function does not perform any checks on the provided callback function. If a null callback function is passed to this function, it will attempt to call the null function, resulting in a null pointer dereference. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_cb() function should be modified to check if the provided callback function is null before calling it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before calling the callback function. For example: if (cb!= NULL) { EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_cb(ctx, cb); } This will prevent the null pointer dereference
