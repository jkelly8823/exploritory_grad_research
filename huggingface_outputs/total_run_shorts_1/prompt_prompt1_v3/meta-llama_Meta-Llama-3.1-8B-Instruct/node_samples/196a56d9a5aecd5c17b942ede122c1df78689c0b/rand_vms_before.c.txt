VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of the `getpid()` function, which can be slow on some systems. Additionally, the use of `sys$gettim_prec()` and `sys$gettim()` functions can also be slow, especially on systems that do not support high-resolution timers.
EXPLANATION: The `getpid()` function can be slow on some systems, such as those with a high number of processes or those that use a slow process ID allocation mechanism. Similarly, the `sys$gettim_prec()` and `sys$gettim()` functions can be slow on systems that do not support high-resolution timers. This can allow an attacker to measure the time it takes to execute certain code paths, potentially revealing sensitive information about the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a faster alternative to `getpid()`, such as `getpid_fast()` if available. Additionally, consider using a high-resolution timer that is not dependent on the `sys$gettim_prec()` and `sys$gettim()` functions. One possible solution is to use the `clock_gettime()` function, which is
