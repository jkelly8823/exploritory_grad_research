VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Format string vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a format string vulnerability in the PRINTF_FORMAT macro. The macro is defined with a format string that is not properly sanitized, which can lead to a format string vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to leak sensitive information or even execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the PRINTF_FORMAT macro should be modified to use a secure format string. One way to do this is to use the %s format specifier and pass the format string as an argument to the printf function. For example: printf("%s", format_string);. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all format strings are properly sanitized and validated. It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice such as using a format string library like fmtlib.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the format string is not user-controlled. If it is, then the code should be modified to prevent user-controlled format strings.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the format string is not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.  If it is, then the code should be modified
