VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The vulnerability is in the line where the code attempts to execute a command using the @cmd array. The attacker can manipulate the @cmd array to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the join function to concatenate the elements of the @cmd array into a single string, which is then executed using the die function. However, if an attacker can manipulate the @cmd array to include malicious commands, they can inject arbitrary code, potentially leading to a command injection attack. This is a serious vulnerability, as it can allow an attacker to execute any command on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safe method to execute the command, such as using the system function with a properly sanitized input, or using a library that provides a safe way to execute commands. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize the input to the @cmd array to prevent an attacker from manipulating it. For example, the code could use a whitelist of allowed commands and check that the input matches one of those commands. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious
