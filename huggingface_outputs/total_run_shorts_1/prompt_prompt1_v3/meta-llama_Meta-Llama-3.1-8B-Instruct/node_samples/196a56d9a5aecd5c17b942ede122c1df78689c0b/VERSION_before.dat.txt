 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a simple configuration file, defining various constants for a build process. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, such as user input handling, database queries, or network communication. The variables defined in this snippet are all string or integer values, and do not appear to be used in any way that could compromise security.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is generally a good practice to ensure that sensitive information, such as the RELEASE_DATE, is not hardcoded in a configuration file. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve this information, such as an environment variable or a secure storage mechanism.  ```bash
# Consider using an environment variable or a secure storage mechanism for RELEASE_DATE
RELEASE_DATE=${RELEASE_DATE:-$(date +%s)}
``` ```bash
# Consider using an environment variable or a secure storage mechanism for RELEASE_DATE
RELEASE_DATE=${RELEASE_DATE:-$(date +%s)}
``` ```bash
