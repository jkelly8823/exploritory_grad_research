VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of OPENSSL_strndup() without checking its return value.
EXPLANATION: The function OPENSSL_strndup() is used to allocate memory for the file path. However, the return value of this function is not checked for NULL. If OPENSSL_strndup() fails to allocate memory, it will return NULL, but the code does not handle this case. This can lead to a buffer overflow when trying to access the file path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Check the return value of OPENSSL_strndup() and handle the case where it returns NULL. This can be done by checking if the return value is NULL before using it, and if so, handle the error accordingly. For example, you can return an error or log the issue. Additionally, consider using a safer function like OPENSSL_strdup() which does not have this vulnerability.
