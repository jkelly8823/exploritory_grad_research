VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The variable "info" is freed before it is used in the line "NCONF_free(conf);".
EXPLANATION: The variable "info" is freed in the line "OSSL_CMP_CTX_free(cmp_ctx);". However, in the line "NCONF_free(conf);", the variable "info" is still being used indirectly. This is because the variable "info" is used to set the "server" and "port" fields in the line "info->server = opt_server;" and "info->port = server_port;", which are still in scope when the line "NCONF_free(conf);" is executed. This creates a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The variable "info" should be freed before it is used in the line "NCONF_free(conf);". This can be achieved by moving the line "OSSL_CMP_CTX_free(cmp_ctx);", which frees the variable "info", to after the line "NCONF_free(conf);". Alternatively, the variable "info" can be freed in a separate function that is called after the line "NCONF_free
