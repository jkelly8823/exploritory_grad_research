VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `memcpy` function without checking the size of the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `memcpy` function is used to copy the contents of the `dummy_cookie` array into the `cookie` buffer. However, the size of the `cookie` buffer is not checked before the copy operation, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the `dummy_cookie` array is larger than the `cookie` buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the size of the `cookie` buffer before copying the contents of the `dummy_cookie` array into it. This can be done by using the `memcpy_s` function, which is a safer version of the `memcpy` function that checks the size of the destination buffer. Alternatively, the code can use a loop to copy the contents of the `dummy_cookie` array into the `cookie` buffer, which allows for more control over the copy operation and can help prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer function, such as `strncpy`, to copy the contents of the
