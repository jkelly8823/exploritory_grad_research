 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey function returns a null pointer if it fails to create a new context. However, the code does not check for this possibility before calling EVP_PKEY_param_check on the returned pointer. If EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey fails, the code will attempt to call EVP_PKEY_param_check on a null pointer, leading to a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey function is used to create a new context for a public key. However, this function can return a null pointer if it fails to create the context. The code does not check for this possibility before calling EVP_PKEY_param_check on the returned pointer. This is a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey to ensure that it is not null before calling EVP_PKEY_param_check on the returned pointer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the returned pointer is null before proceeding
