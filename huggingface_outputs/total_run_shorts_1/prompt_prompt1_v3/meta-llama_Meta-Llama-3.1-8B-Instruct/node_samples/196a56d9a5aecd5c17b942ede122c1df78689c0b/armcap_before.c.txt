VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition due to the use of sigsetjmp and sigaction without proper synchronization.
EXPLANATION: The code uses sigsetjmp to save the current state of the program and then calls _armv7_tick, which may modify the program's state. However, the sigaction call to set the signal handler for SIGILL is made without any synchronization, which means that if the signal is delivered between the sigsetjmp and sigaction calls, the program's state may be inconsistent. This can lead to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a mutex or other synchronization primitive to ensure that the sigaction call is made after the sigsetjmp call. Alternatively, the code could use a different approach to handle the SIGILL signal that does not involve modifying the program's state. For example, it could use a signal handler that simply logs the signal and continues execution.  The code should also consider using sigprocmask to block the SIGILL signal while the sigaction call is made to prevent the signal from being delivered during this time.  This will prevent the race
