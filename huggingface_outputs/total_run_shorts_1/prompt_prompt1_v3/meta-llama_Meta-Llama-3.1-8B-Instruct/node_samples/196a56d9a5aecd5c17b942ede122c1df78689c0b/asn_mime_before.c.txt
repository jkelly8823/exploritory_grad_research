VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the lack of proper cleanup of the BIO objects. Specifically, the BIO objects are not being freed in all cases, which can lead to memory leaks.
EXPLANATION: The code uses BIO objects to perform various operations, but it does not properly clean up these objects in all cases. For example, in the `if (flags & SMIME_STREAM)` block, the `bio` object is not freed when an error occurs. Similarly, in the `else` block, the `out` object is not freed when an error occurs. This can lead to memory leaks, which can cause the program to consume increasing amounts of memory over time.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly clean up the BIO objects in all cases. This can be done by adding calls to `BIO_free` to free the objects when they are no longer needed. For example, in
