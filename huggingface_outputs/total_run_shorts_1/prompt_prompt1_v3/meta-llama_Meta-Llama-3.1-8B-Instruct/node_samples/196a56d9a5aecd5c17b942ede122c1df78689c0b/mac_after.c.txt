 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential resource leak due to the use of goto statements without proper cleanup of resources.
EXPLANATION: The use of goto statements can lead to unpredictable control flow, making it difficult to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up. In this case, the goto statements are used to jump to the err label, but the resources opened by bio_open_default are not properly closed before the jump. This can lead to a resource leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be refactored to use a more structured approach to error handling, such as using a try-catch block or a more explicit return statement. Additionally, the resources opened by bio_open_default should be properly closed before the jump to the err label. For example, the code could be modified to use a try-finally block to ensure that the resources are closed regardless of whether an error occurs. ```c
    in = bio_open_default(infile, 'r', inform);
    if (in == NULL) {
        // Close the resource here
        bio_free(in);
        goto err;
    }
``` ```c
    try
