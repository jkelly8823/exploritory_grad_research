VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the function i2d_CMS_ContentInfo. The function does not properly validate the length of the CMS_ContentInfo structure before passing it to the ossl_cms_ctx_get0_libctx function. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The function i2d_CMS_ContentInfo takes a CMS_ContentInfo structure as input and returns a pointer to an unsigned char array. However, it does not check the length of the CMS_ContentInfo structure before passing it to the ossl_cms_ctx_get0_libctx function. This function is responsible for retrieving the library context from the CMS_ContentInfo structure. If the CMS_ContentInfo structure is larger than expected, it could cause the buffer to overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function i2d_CMS_ContentInfo should be modified to properly validate the length of the CMS_ContentInfo structure before passing it to the ossl_cms_ctx_get0_libctx function. This can be done by checking the size of the CMS_ContentInfo structure and ensuring that
