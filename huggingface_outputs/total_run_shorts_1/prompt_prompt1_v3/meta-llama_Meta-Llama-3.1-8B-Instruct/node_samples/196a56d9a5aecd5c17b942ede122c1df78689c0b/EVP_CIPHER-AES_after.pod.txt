VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: ECB mode is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks and is generally considered insecure.
EXPLANATION: ECB mode is a block cipher mode of operation that encrypts each block of plaintext independently. This means that identical blocks of plaintext will always produce identical blocks of ciphertext, which can lead to predictable patterns in the ciphertext. This predictability can be exploited by an attacker to launch a padding oracle attack, which can allow them to recover the plaintext. ECB mode is generally considered insecure and should not be used in practice.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a more secure block cipher mode of operation, such as CBC or GCM. If you must use ECB mode, ensure that the plaintext is properly randomized before encryption to prevent predictable patterns in the ciphertext. Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the initialization vector (IV) for the block cipher. Additionally, consider using a authenticated encryption mode, such as GCM, which provides both confidentiality and integrity protection.  --- 
```python
def encrypt(plaintext, key):
    # Generate a random 128-bit initialization vector (IV)
    iv = os.urandom(16)
    
    # Create a new AES cipher object with
