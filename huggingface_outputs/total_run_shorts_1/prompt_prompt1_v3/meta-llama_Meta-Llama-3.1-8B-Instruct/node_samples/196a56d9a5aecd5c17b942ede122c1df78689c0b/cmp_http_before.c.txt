 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function keep_alive() does not properly validate the input parameter body_type. It does not check if body_type is within the valid range of values for the enum OSSL_CMP_PKIBODY_*. This can lead to a potential out-of-bounds access or incorrect behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function keep_alive() uses a series of logical AND operators to check if the body_type is not equal to certain values. However, it does not check if body_type is within the valid range of values for the enum OSSL_CMP_PKIBODY_*. This can lead to a potential out-of-bounds access or incorrect behavior. For example, if an attacker passes a value of OSSL_CMP_PKIBODY_MAX + 1 to the function, it will not be caught by the current checks and may lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function keep_alive() should be modified to check if body_type is within the valid range of values for the enum OSSL_CMP_PKIBODY_*. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that body_type is within the valid range. For
