 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The vulnerability is located in the line where the code attempts to execute a command using the system function. The code uses the $^X variable, which contains the path to the Perl interpreter, and the $xlate variable, which is not sanitized, to construct the command. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the $xlate variable.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the system function to execute a command, which is a common way to execute shell commands in Perl. However, the code does not properly sanitize the $xlate variable, which makes it vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious commands by manipulating the $xlate variable, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer way to execute commands, such as using the IPC::Open3 module or the Capture::Tiny module. The code should also sanitize the $xlate variable to prevent command injection attacks. For example, the code could use the Text::Sanitize module to sanitize the $xlate variable before using it to construct the command.
