VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of input validation on the 'rule' variable.
EXPLANATION: The 'rule' variable is not validated before being used in a switch statement. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for the 'rule' variable. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the 'rule' variable to ensure it is within a valid range before using it in the switch statement. This can be done by adding a simple check to ensure the 'rule' variable is within the expected range. For example: if (rule < 0 || rule >= CIPHER_RULE_MAX) { ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_SSL, SSL_R_INVALID_COMMAND); return 0; } This will prevent an attacker from overflowing the buffer by providing an invalid value for the 'rule' variable. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as an enum, to represent the 'rule' variable to prevent similar issues in the future.
