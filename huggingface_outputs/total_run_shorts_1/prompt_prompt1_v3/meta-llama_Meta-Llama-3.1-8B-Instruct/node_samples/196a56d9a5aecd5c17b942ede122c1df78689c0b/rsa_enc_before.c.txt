VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_string` function is used to retrieve a string from the `params` structure, but the buffer size is not checked to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the retrieved string is longer than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_string` function to retrieve a string from the `params` structure. However, the buffer size is not checked to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the retrieved string is longer than the buffer size. The `sizeof(mdname)` and `sizeof(mdprops)` are used as the buffer size, but these values are not guaranteed to be sufficient to hold the retrieved string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the retrieved string before copying it to the buffer. This can be done by using the `OSSL_PARAM_get_utf8_string_len` function, which returns the length of the retrieved string. The code should also ensure
