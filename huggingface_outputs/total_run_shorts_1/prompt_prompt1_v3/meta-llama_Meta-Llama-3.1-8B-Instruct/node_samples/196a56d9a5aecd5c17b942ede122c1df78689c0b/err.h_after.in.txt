 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines a set of error codes using a combination of macros. However, the use of magic numbers (e.g., 10, 11, 13, etc.) is a vulnerability. These numbers are not self-explanatory and can lead to errors if not properly understood or maintained.
EXPLANATION: The code defines a set of error codes using a combination of macros. The error codes are defined as a combination of a library identifier and a flag. The library identifiers are defined as magic numbers, which are not self-explanatory. This can lead to errors if not properly understood or maintained. For example, the error code ERR_R_DSA_LIB is defined as (ERR_LIB_DSA|ERR_RFLAG_COMMON), where ERR_LIB_DSA is a magic number. If the meaning of this number changes, the error code will also change, potentially leading to errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use named constants instead of magic numbers. For example, the error code ERR_R_DSA_LIB could be defined as (ERR_LIB_DSA|ERR_RFLAG_COMMON), where ERR_LIB_DSA is a named constant
