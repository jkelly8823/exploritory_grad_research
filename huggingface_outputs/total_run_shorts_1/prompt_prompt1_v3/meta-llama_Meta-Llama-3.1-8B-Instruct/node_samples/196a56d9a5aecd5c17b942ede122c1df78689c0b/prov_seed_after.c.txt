VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function ossl_rand_get_entropy() and ossl_rand_get_nonce() do not properly handle the entropy and nonce generation, respectively. They return a size_t value of 0, indicating no entropy or nonce was generated, but do not actually generate any entropy or nonce.
EXPLANATION: The functions ossl_rand_get_entropy() and ossl_rand_get_nonce() are supposed to generate entropy and nonce values, respectively. However, they do not actually perform any entropy or nonce generation. They simply return a size_t value of 0, indicating no entropy or nonce was generated. This is a critical vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to predict the generated values, compromising the security of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The functions ossl_rand_get_entropy() and ossl_rand_get_nonce() should be modified to properly generate entropy and nonce values. This can be done by using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the values. Additionally, the functions should be modified to handle errors and exceptions properly, to prevent crashes or other security issues. The functions should also be modified to return the actual size
