 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential OpenSSL vulnerability due to the use of the `disabled` function to check for FIPS mode. The `disabled` function is deprecated and may not work as expected in future versions of OpenSSL.
EXPLANATION: The `disabled` function is used to check if FIPS mode is disabled, but it is deprecated and may not work as expected in future versions of OpenSSL. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when verifying the certificate. A more reliable way to check for FIPS mode is to use the `FIPS_mode()` function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the `disabled` function with the `FIPS_mode()` function to check for FIPS mode. For example: `my $no_fips = FIPS_mode() || ($ENV{NO_FIPS} // 0);` This will ensure that the code works correctly even in future versions of OpenSSL. Additionally, consider using a more modern and reliable way to check for FIPS mode, such as using the `OpenSSL::FIPS` module.  VULNERABLE: YES
