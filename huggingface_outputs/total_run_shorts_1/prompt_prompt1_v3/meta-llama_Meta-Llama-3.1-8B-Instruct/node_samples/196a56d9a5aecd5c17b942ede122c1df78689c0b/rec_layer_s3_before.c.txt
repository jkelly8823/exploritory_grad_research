 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `num` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `num` variable is incremented in the loop without any checks on its maximum value. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the number of records is large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking on the `num` variable to prevent buffer overflow. For example, you can use a maximum value for `num` and check if it exceeds that value before returning. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as `size_t`, to represent the number of records.
