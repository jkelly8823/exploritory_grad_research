VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `params` array in the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length` function.
EXPLANATION: The `params` array is declared with a fixed size of 2, but it is not checked if the `OSSL_PARAM_construct_size_t` function will exceed this size. If the function returns an error, the `params` array will not be properly initialized, leading to a potential buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to dynamically allocate memory for the `params` array based on the number of parameters required. Additionally, the code should check the return value of `OSSL_PARAM_construct_size_t` to ensure that the array is properly initialized. The `params` array should also be checked for buffer overflow attacks by ensuring that the number of parameters does not exceed the allocated size.
