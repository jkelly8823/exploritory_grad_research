VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential command injection attack. The `run` function is used to execute a command with user-controlled input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The `run` function is used to execute a command with user-controlled input, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. In this case, the input is the output of the `app` function, which can contain arbitrary shell metacharacters. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious commands and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `run` function should be used with caution and only with trusted input. Alternatively, consider using a safer alternative, such as `system` or `IPC::Open3`, to execute the command. Additionally, ensure that the input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential command injection attacks. The `app` function should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not produce any output that can be used to inject malicious commands. The `srctop_file` function should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not produce any output that can be used to inject malicious
