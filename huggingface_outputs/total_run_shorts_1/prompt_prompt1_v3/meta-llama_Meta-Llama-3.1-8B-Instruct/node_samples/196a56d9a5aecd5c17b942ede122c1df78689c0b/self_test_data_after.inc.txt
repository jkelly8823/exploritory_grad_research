VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size array (ST_KAT_PARAM) to store a variable number of parameters. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input that exceeds the size of the array, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The ST_KAT_PARAM_BIGNUM macro is used to add a parameter to the ST_KAT_PARAM array. However, the size of the array is fixed, and there is no mechanism to prevent an attacker from adding more parameters than the array can hold. This could lead to a buffer overflow, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamic data structure, such as a linked list or a vector, to store the parameters. Alternatively, you could use a variable-size array and ensure that the number of parameters added does not exceed the size of the array. Additionally, consider implementing bounds checking to prevent an attacker from adding too many parameters.  ```c
