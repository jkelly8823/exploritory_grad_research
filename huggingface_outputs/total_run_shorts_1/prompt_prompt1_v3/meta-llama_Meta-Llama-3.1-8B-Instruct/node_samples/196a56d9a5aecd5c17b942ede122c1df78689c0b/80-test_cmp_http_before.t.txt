VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition when stopping the mock server. The kill function is called immediately after the stop_mock_server function, which may not have completed its task. This could lead to the mock server being killed prematurely, causing unexpected behavior or crashes.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the stop_mock_server function is asynchronous, and the kill function is called synchronously. This means that the kill function may be executed before the stop_mock_server function has finished its task, leading to a potential race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the kill function should be called after the stop_mock_server function has completed its task. This can be achieved by using a callback or a promise to ensure that the kill function is executed only after the stop_mock_server function has finished. Alternatively, the stop_mock_server function can be modified to wait for its task to complete before returning, eliminating the need for the kill function to be called synchronously.
