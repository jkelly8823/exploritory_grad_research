 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability related to the BIO_ctrl_pending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() functions. These functions can return values greater than INT_MAX on error in older versions of OpenSSL, which can lead to buffer overflows and other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_ctrl_pending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() functions are used to retrieve the amount of pending data in a BIO. However, in older versions of OpenSSL, these functions can return values greater than INT_MAX on error, which can cause buffer overflows and other security issues. This is because the functions do not properly handle errors and can return arbitrary values.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle the potential return values of BIO_ctrl_pending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() correctly. This can be done by checking the return value of these functions and handling any errors that may occur. Additionally, the code should be updated to use the newer versions of OpenSSL that do not have this issue. Specifically, the code should be updated to use OpenSSL 3.0.4 or later, which has been modified to never return -1 in these functions.
