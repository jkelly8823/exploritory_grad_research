VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to BIO_gets() function which does not perform bounds checking on the input data.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_gets() function is used to read a line from a BIO (Basic I/O) object. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which means that if the input data is longer than the buffer size, it can overflow the buffer and potentially cause a buffer overflow vulnerability. In this case, the buffer size is set to BUFSIZE, but the input data is read into the buffer without any checks, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function like BIO_read() or BIO_gets() with bounds checking, or use a library that provides a safer way to read data from a BIO object. Additionally, you should consider using a fixed-size buffer to prevent buffer overflow attacks. You can also use a library like OpenSSL's SSL_read() function, which provides a safer way to read data from a BIO object.
