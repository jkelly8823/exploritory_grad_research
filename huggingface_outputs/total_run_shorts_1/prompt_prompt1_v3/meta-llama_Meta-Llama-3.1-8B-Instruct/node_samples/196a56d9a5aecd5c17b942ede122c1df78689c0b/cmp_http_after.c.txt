VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The function `keep_alive` takes two integer parameters, `keep_alive` and `body_type`. However, the function does not check if `body_type` is null before dereferencing it. If `body_type` is null, the function will attempt to access memory at address 0, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a null check for `body_type` before dereferencing it. For example, you can add a check at the beginning of the function: `if (body_type == NULL) return -1;`. This will prevent the function from attempting to access memory at address 0 when `body_type` is null. Additionally, consider using a more robust data type, such as a pointer to an enum, to represent the body type. This will help prevent similar issues in the future.  ```c
int keep_alive(int keep_alive, int body_type)
{
    if (body_type == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (keep_alive!= 0
