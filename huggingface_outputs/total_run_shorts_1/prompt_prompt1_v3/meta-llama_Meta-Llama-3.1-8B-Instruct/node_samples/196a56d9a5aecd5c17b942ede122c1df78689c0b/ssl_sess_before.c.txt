VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists in the code. The function remove_session_lock() is called without acquiring the lock on the session cache, which can lead to a race condition when multiple threads are accessing the session cache simultaneously.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using a lock to protect access to the session cache, but the lock is not held when calling remove_session_lock(). This can lead to a situation where one thread is removing a session from the cache while another thread is still accessing it, resulting in undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lock on the session cache should be held when calling remove_session_lock(). This can be achieved by acquiring the lock before calling remove_session_lock() and releasing it afterwards. For example: CRYPTO_THREAD_lock(ctx->lock); remove_session_lock(ctx, ctx->session_cache_tail, 0); CRYPTO_THREAD_unlock(ctx->lock);. This will ensure that the session cache is properly protected from concurrent access.  ```c
int SSL_CTX_sess_remove_session(SSL_CTX *ctx, SSL_SESSION *c)
{
    SSL_SESSION *s = SSL_SESSION_find_session(ctx, c->session_id);
