VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_push does not properly handle the memory allocation for the debug information. It does not check if the memory allocation was successful before returning -1.
EXPLANATION: The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_push is supposed to push debug information onto a stack. However, it does not check if the memory allocation was successful before returning -1. This can lead to a memory leak if the memory allocation fails. The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_pop does not pop the debug information from the stack, it simply returns -1. This means that the debug information is not being properly managed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_push should check if the memory allocation was successful before returning -1. It should also check if the memory allocation was successful before pushing the debug information onto the stack. The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_pop should pop the debug information from the stack before returning. The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_malloc should check if the memory allocation was successful before returning. It should also check if the memory allocation was successful before allocating memory for the debug information.  The function CRYPTO_mem_debug_malloc should also check if the memory allocation
