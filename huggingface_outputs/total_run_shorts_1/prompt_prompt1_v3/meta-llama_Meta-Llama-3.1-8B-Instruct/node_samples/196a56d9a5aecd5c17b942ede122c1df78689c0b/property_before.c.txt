VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the ossl_method_store_free function. The function does not check if the store->algs pointer is NULL before calling ossl_sa_ALGORITHM_doall_arg on it. If the ossl_sa_ALGORITHM_free function has already freed the store->algs pointer, then calling ossl_sa_ALGORITHM_doall_arg on it will result in a use-after-free error.
EXPLANATION: The ossl_method_store_free function is responsible for freeing the memory allocated to the OSSL_METHOD_STORE structure. However, it does not check if the store->algs pointer is NULL before calling ossl_sa_ALGORITHM_doall_arg on it. This can lead to a use-after-free error if the ossl_sa_ALGORITHM_free function has already freed the store->algs pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the ossl_method_store_free function should check if the store->algs pointer is NULL before calling ossl_sa_ALGORITHM_doall_arg on it. If the pointer is NULL, then the function should return immediately without attempting to free the memory. Additionally, the ossl_sa_ALGORITHM
