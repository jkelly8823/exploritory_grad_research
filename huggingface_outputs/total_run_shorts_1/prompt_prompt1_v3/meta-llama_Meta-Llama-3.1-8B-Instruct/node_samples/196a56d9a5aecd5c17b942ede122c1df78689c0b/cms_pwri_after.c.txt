VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of RAND_bytes_ex, which can leak information about the entropy of the random number generator.
EXPLANATION: The RAND_bytes_ex function can return early if the entropy is low, which can be used to infer information about the internal state of the random number generator. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform a timing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) that is designed to be resistant to timing attacks. One option is to use the OpenSSL function RAND_bytes, which is designed to be secure and resistant to timing attacks. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator library such as Fortuna or Yarrow. It is also recommended to use a secure random number generator that is not dependent on the internal state of the random number generator.  ```c
    RAND_bytes(iv, ivlen);
``` 
This will ensure that the random number generation is secure and resistant to timing attacks. 
```c
    RAND_bytes_ex(ossl_cms_ctx_get0_libctx(cms_ctx), iv
