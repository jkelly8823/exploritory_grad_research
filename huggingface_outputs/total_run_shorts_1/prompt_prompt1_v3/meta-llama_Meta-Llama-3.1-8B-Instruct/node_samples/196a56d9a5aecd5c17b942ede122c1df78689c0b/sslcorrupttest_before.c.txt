VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of a variable 'docorrupt' without proper initialization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'docorrupt' is declared but not initialized before being used. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the value of 'docorrupt' is not properly validated or sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Initialize the variable 'docorrupt' with a default value or validate its input to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks. Consider using a secure method to initialize the variable, such as using a secure random number generator. Additionally, ensure that the variable is properly sanitized before using it in any operations.  ```bash
docorrupt = 0;
``` should be replaced with ```bash
docorrupt = 0;
if (docorrupt < 0 || docorrupt > 255) {
    // handle error
}
``` to ensure the value of 'docorrupt' is within a valid range. ```bash
docorrupt = 0;
``` should be replaced with ```bash
docorrupt = rand() % 256;
``` to ensure the value of 'doc
