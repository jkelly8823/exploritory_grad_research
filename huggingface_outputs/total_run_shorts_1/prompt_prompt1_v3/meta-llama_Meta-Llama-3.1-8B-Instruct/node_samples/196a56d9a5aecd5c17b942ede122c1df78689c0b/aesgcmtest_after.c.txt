VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function do_encrypt and do_decrypt are not checked for NULL pointer dereferences. This could lead to a segmentation fault if either of these functions are called with a NULL pointer.
EXPLANATION: The functions do_encrypt and do_decrypt are called with pointers to iv_gen, ct, ctlen, tag, and taglen. However, there is no check to ensure that these pointers are not NULL before they are dereferenced. This could lead to a segmentation fault if any of these pointers are NULL.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Before calling do_encrypt and do_decrypt, check that the pointers to iv_gen, ct, ctlen, tag, and taglen are not NULL. If any of these pointers are NULL, return an error code or handle the situation accordingly. For example, you could add a check at the beginning of the ivgen_test function like this: if (iv_gen == NULL || ct == NULL || ctlen == NULL || tag == NULL || taglen == NULL) return -1;. This will prevent a segmentation fault from occurring.  Additionally, consider using a more robust way to handle errors, such as using an error handling framework.
