VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `tbslen` variable when calling `ossl_ed25519_sign` and `ossl_ed448_sign` functions.
EXPLANATION: The `tbslen` variable is used to specify the length of the input data `tbs` to the `ossl_ed25519_sign` and `ossl_ed448_sign` functions. However, there is no check to ensure that `tbslen` is within the valid range for the input data. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large value for `tbslen`, leading to undefined behavior and potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the `tbslen` variable to ensure it is within the valid range for the input data. This can be done by checking if `tbslen` is less than or equal to the actual length of the input data `tbs`. If it is not, return an error or handle the situation accordingly
