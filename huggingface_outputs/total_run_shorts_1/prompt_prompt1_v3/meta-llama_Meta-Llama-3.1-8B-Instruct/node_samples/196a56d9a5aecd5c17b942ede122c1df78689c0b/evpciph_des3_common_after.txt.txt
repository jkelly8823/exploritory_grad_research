 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a padding oracle attack due to the use of ECB mode with DES-EDE3 cipher. ECB mode is deterministic and does not provide any randomness, making it predictable and vulnerable to attacks.
EXPLANATION: The use of ECB mode with DES-EDE3 cipher is a significant security risk. ECB mode is a block cipher mode that encrypts each block independently, without any relationship between the blocks. This makes it predictable and vulnerable to attacks. DES-EDE3 is a block cipher that uses a 64-bit block size and a 56-bit key size. The use of ECB mode with DES-EDE3 cipher makes it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, where an attacker can determine the plaintext by manipulating the padding.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure block cipher mode, such as CBC or GCM. Additionally, the code should use a more secure cipher, such as AES. The code should also ensure that the IV is generated randomly and is not fixed. Finally, the code should use a secure padding scheme, such as PKCS#7.  The code should also be updated to use
