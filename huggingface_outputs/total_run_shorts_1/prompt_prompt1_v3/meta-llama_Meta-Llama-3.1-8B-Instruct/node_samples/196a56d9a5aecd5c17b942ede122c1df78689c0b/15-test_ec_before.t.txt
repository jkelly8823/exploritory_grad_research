VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of the `srctop_file` function, which may allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `srctop_file` function is used to retrieve a file from a specific location, but it does not perform any validation on the file path. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `srctop_file` function should be modified to perform proper path validation, such as using a whitelist of allowed directories or using a library that provides path validation functionality. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that any user-inputted file paths are properly sanitized and validated.  The `srctop_file` function should also be audited to ensure it does not have any unintended side effects.  It may also be beneficial to use a more secure method of file retrieval, such as using a library that provides secure file access functionality.  Finally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is following best
