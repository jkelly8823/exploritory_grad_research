VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a foreach loop with a hardcoded index. This can lead to an out-of-bounds error if the index is not properly validated.
EXPLANATION: The foreach loop is iterating over the indices of the $curves_tls_1_2 array, but it is not checking if the index is within the bounds of the array. If the index is not valid, it can lead to an out-of-bounds error, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the foreach loop should be replaced with a foreach loop that iterates over the values of the array, rather than the indices. This can be done by using the foreach loop with the => syntax, like this: foreach my $curve (@$curves_tls_1_2) {... }. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all indices are properly validated before accessing the array.  ```php
foreach my $curve (@$curves_tls_1_2) {... }
```  ```php
