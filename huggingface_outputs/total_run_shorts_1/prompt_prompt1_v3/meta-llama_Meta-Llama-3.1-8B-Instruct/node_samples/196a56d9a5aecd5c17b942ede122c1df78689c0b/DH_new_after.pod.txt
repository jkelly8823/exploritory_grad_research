VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains deprecated functions from OpenSSL 3.0.
EXPLANATION: The functions DH_new and DH_free are deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0. This means that they will be removed in future versions of OpenSSL. The code snippet should be updated to use the recommended replacement functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Update the code to use the recommended replacement functions, such as EVP_PKEY-DH, as described in EVP_PKEY-DH(7). This will ensure that the code remains compatible with future versions of OpenSSL. Additionally, consider defining OPENSSL_API_COMPAT with a suitable version value to hide the deprecated functions entirely.  Please see openssl_user_macros(7) for more information.  Also, consider updating the copyright notice to reflect the current year.  The current copyright notice only goes up to 2022.  It should be updated to include the current year.
