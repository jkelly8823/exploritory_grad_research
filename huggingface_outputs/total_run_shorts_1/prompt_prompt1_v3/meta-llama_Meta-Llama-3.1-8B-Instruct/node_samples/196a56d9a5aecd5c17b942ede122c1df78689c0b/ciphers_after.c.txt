 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in the code. The variable 'c' is being reassigned a new value from the'sk_SSL_CIPHER_value' function, but the original value of 'c' is still being used in the previous line.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises when the code reassigns the value of 'c' to a new value from the'sk_SSL_CIPHER_value' function, but the original value of 'c' is still being used in the previous line. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, where the original value of 'c' is no longer valid, but the code is still trying to access it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the original value of 'c' is not used after it has been reassigned. This can be achieved by reassigning the value of 'c' to a new variable, or by removing the reassignment and using the original value of 'c' consistently throughout the code. For example, the corrected code could be: if (i!= 0) { const SSL_CIPHER *c = sk_SSL_CIPHER
