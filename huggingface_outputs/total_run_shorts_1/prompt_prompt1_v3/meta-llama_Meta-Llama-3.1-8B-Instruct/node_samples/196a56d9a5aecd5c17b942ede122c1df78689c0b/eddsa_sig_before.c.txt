 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `ossl_ed25519_sign` and `ossl_ed448_sign` functions without proper bounds checking. These functions may return a value of 0 to indicate failure, but they do not provide any information about the length of the signature that was generated. If an attacker can manipulate the `tbs` and `tbslen` parameters to cause the functions to generate a signature that is longer than expected, it may lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is part of a cryptographic library that implements the Ed25519 and Ed448 digital signature algorithms. The `ossl_ed25519_sign` and `ossl_ed448_sign` functions are used to generate digital signatures for a given message digest. However, these functions do not provide any information about the length of the generated signature, making it difficult to perform proper bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if an attacker can manipulate the `tbs` and `tbslen` parameters to cause the functions to generate a signature that is longer than expected.
