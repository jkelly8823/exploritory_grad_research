 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a memory debugging library, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The functions provided are for memory debugging purposes and do not allocate or deallocate memory. They also do not perform any operations that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or double-free. The functions are also not using any user-supplied input without proper validation, which reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are provided as the code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, consider implementing additional checks and validation for user-supplied input in the future if the library is extended to handle such inputs.  ```bash
