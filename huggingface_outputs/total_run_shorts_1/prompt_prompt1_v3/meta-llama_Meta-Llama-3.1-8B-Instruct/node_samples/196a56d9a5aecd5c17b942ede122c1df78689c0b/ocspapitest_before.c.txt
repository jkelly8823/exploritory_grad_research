VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the sizeof operator on a variable of type char[].
EXPLANATION: The sizeof operator returns the size of the keybytes variable in bytes, which is a char[]. However, the ASN1_BIT_STRING_set function expects the length of the string in bits. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the keybytes variable is not a multiple of 8.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the strlen function to get the length of the keybytes variable in bytes, and then multiply it by 8 to get the length in bits. The corrected code should look like this: ASN1_BIT_STRING_set(key, keybytes, strlen(keybytes) * 8);.
