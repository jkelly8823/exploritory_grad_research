VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is present in the line where the `mkdef` variable is being executed. The `mkdef` variable is being passed as a string to the `PERL` command, which can lead to command injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `mkdef` variable to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `mkdef` variable should be sanitized or validated to prevent any malicious input. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the input or by using a library that provides input sanitization. Additionally, the `PERL` command should be executed with the `safe` option to prevent any potential command injection attacks. For example: `"\$(PERL)" -safe "$mkdef"$ord_ver...`. This will ensure that the `PERL` command is executed in a safe mode, preventing any malicious input from being executed. 

Note: The `PERL` command is being used to execute a Perl script, which is not a typical use case. It's recommended to use a more secure
