VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If prm->data is null, then the code will attempt to access the memory location pointed to by prm->data, resulting in a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if prm->data is null before attempting to access it. This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability. The code snippet is also missing a check for prm->data_type being equal to OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING before attempting to access prm->data. However, the vulnerability is still present even if prm->data_type is not equal to OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if prm->data is null before attempting to access it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the if statement. For example: if (prm->data!= NULL && prm->data_type == OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING &&...). Additionally, the code should also check if prm->data_type is equal to OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING before attempting to access prm->data
