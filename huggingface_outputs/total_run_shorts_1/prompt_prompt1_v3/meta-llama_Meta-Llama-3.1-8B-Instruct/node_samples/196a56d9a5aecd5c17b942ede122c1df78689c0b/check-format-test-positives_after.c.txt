 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains multiple vulnerabilities including unexpected closing parenthesis, missing blank line after local declarations, missing blank line before function body, unclosed #if, unclosed brace at decl/block level, unclosed brace at enum/expression level, unclosed parenthesis, unclosed '? (conditional expression), and unclosed bracket in expression.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains several vulnerabilities that can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. The unexpected closing parenthesis on line 9 can cause the compiler to misinterpret the code. The missing blank line after local declarations on line 11 can make the code harder to read and understand. The missing blank line before the function body on line 13 can also make the code harder to read and understand. The unclosed #if on line 15 can cause the compiler to include unnecessary code. The unclosed brace at decl/block level on line 17 can cause the compiler to misinterpret the code. The unclosed brace at enum/expression level on line 19 can cause the compiler to misinterpret the code. The
