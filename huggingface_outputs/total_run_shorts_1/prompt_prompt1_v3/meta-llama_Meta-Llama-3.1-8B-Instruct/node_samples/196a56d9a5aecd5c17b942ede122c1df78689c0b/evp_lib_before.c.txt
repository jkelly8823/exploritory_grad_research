VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() does not check for NULL pointer dereferences when accessing the EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() function does not check if the EVP_CIPHER_CTX pointer is NULL before accessing its members. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if a NULL pointer is passed to the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function should be modified to check for NULL pointer dereferences before accessing the EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure. This can be done by adding a simple NULL check at the beginning of the function. For example: if (ctx == NULL) return -1; or throw an exception. This will prevent the function from accessing the EVP_CIPHER_CTX structure if it is NULL.
