VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function X509_verify() does not properly check the signature of the certificate. It only checks if the signature algorithm is the same as the certificate's signature algorithm, but it does not verify the actual signature.
EXPLANATION: The function X509_verify() is supposed to verify the signature of the certificate. However, it only checks if the signature algorithm is the same as the certificate's signature algorithm. This is not sufficient to ensure the certificate's authenticity. An attacker could create a certificate with a different signature algorithm but the same signature, which would be accepted by this function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function X509_verify() should be modified to properly verify the signature of the certificate. This can be done by using the ASN1_item_verify_ex() function to verify the signature. The function should also check if the signature algorithm is the same as the certificate's signature algorithm. If the signature is not verified or the signature algorithm is not the same, the function should return an error.
