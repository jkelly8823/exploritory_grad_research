 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of EVP_PKEY_fromdata() and EVP_PKEY_todata() functions, which can be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks if not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_fromdata() and EVP_PKEY_todata() functions can be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks if the input data is not properly sanitized. This is because these functions do not perform any bounds checking on the input data, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input data is larger than expected. This can result in arbitrary code execution and potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the input data is properly sanitized before passing it to the EVP_PKEY_fromdata() and EVP_PKEY_todata() functions. This can be done by using functions such as EVP_PKEY_fromdata_ex() and EVP_PKEY_todata_ex(), which perform bounds checking on the input data. Additionally, the code should also validate the input data to ensure that it conforms to the expected format. This can be done by using functions such as EVP_PKEY_fromdata_ex()
