VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `disabled` function without proper validation of its input. This function is used to check if certain features are disabled, but it does not perform any input validation, making it susceptible to attacks where an attacker can manipulate the input to cause the function to return incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The `disabled` function is used to check if certain features are disabled, but it does not perform any input validation. This means that an attacker can manipulate the input to cause the function to return incorrect results, leading to a potential DoS attack. For example, if an attacker can manipulate the input to make the function return a value that is not a boolean, it can cause the function to return incorrect results, leading to a potential DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `disabled` function should be modified to perform proper input validation. This can be done by adding checks to ensure that the input is a boolean value. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle cases where the input is not a boolean value, such as by returning
