VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-36
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of sys$gettim() which has a lower time update granularity compared to sys$gettim_prec(). This allows an attacker to potentially predict the sequence number and nonce.
EXPLANATION: The code uses sys$gettim() to get the current time, which has a lower time update granularity compared to sys$gettim_prec(). This makes it possible for an attacker to predict the sequence number and nonce, potentially leading to a timing attack. The use of a sequence number is intended to mitigate this, but it is not sufficient to prevent the attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use sys$gettim_prec() instead of sys$gettim() to get the current time. This will provide a higher time update granularity and make it more difficult for an attacker to predict the sequence number and nonce. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to generate nonces, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.  ```bash
