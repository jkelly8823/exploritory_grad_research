VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size array (ST_KAT_PARAM) to store a variable number of parameters.
EXPLANATION: The ST_KAT_PARAM_BIGNUM macro is used to add parameters to the ST_KAT_PARAM array, but there is no check to prevent the array from overflowing if too many parameters are added. This could potentially allow an attacker to write past the end of the array and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically-sized data structure, such as a linked list or a vector, to store the parameters. Alternatively, add a check to ensure that the array is not overflowed before adding new parameters. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a stack or a heap, to store the parameters. It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice, such as bounds checking, to prevent buffer overflows.  The use of a fixed-size array to store a variable number of parameters is a common source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.  It is recommended to use a safer data structure, such as a linked list or
