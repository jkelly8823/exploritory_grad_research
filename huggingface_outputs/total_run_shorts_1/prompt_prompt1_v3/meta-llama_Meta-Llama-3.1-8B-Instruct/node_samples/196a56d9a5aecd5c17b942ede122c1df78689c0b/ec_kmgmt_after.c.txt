 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for a NULL pointer before calling EC_POINT_point2oct() on it. This can lead to a segmentation fault if ecp is NULL.
EXPLANATION: The code checks for a NULL pointer before calling EC_KEY_get0_public_key() on it, but it does not check for a NULL pointer before calling EC_POINT_point2oct() on the result. This is a classic example of a dangling pointer vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check for a NULL pointer before calling EC_POINT_point2oct() on ecp. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if ecp is NULL before calling the function. For example: if (ecp!= NULL) {... } else {... }.
