VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the EVP_DigestFinal_ex() function without checking the length of the input data.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_DigestFinal_ex() function is used to finalize the digest operation and retrieve the digest value. However, this function does not perform any length checks on the input data, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. An attacker could potentially provide a large amount of input data, causing the function to overflow the buffer and potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input data before calling EVP_DigestFinal_ex(). This can be done by using the EVP_MD_size() function to get the size of the digest value and comparing it to the length of the input data. If the input data is too large, the function should return an error or handle it accordingly. Additionally, consider using a safer function like EVP_DigestFinal() which performs length checks internally.
