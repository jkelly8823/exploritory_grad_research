 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `get_tmp_decoder_store` function is called with a pointer to `store` which is then used in the `OSSL_METHOD_CONSTRUCT_METHOD` struct. However, the `get_tmp_decoder_store` function may return a pointer to a different `store` which could have been freed by the time the `OSSL_METHOD_CONSTRUCT_METHOD` struct is used. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `get_tmp_decoder_store` function is called with a pointer to `store` which is then used in the `OSSL_METHOD_CONSTRUCT_METHOD` struct. However, the `get_tmp_decoder_store` function may return a pointer to a different `store` which could have been freed by the time the `OSSL_METHOD_CONSTRUCT_METHOD` struct is used. This could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. The `OSSL_METHOD_CONSTRUCT_METHOD` struct is used to construct and manage decoder methods, and if the `store` pointer is invalid, it could lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability,
