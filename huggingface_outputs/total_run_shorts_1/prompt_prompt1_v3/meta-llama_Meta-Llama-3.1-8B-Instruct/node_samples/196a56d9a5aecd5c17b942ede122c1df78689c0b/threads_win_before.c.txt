VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of InterlockedOr64 for atomic load operations is incorrect. InterlockedOr64 performs a bitwise OR operation on the current value and the new value, whereas atomic load operations should use InterlockedExchange64 to replace the current value with the new value.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses InterlockedOr64 for both atomic load and atomic or operations. However, InterlockedOr64 is not the correct function to use for atomic load operations. InterlockedOr64 performs a bitwise OR operation on the current value and the new value, whereas atomic load operations should use InterlockedExchange64 to replace the current value with the new value. This can lead to incorrect results and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace InterlockedOr64 with InterlockedExchange64 for atomic load operations. The corrected code should look like this: int CRYPTO_atomic_load(uint64_t *val, uint64_t *ret, CRYPTO_RWLOCK *lock) { *ret = (uint64_t)InterlockedExchange64((LONG64 volatile *)val, 0); return 1; } ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
