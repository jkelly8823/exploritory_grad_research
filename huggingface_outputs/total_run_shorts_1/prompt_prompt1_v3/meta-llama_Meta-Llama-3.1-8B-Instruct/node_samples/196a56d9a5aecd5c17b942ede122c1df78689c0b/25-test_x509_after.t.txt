VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of the `srctop_file` function, which may allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `srctop_file` function is used to construct file paths by joining a base directory with a file name. However, if the file name contains directory traversal characters (e.g., `../`), an attacker may be able to access files outside of the intended directory. This could potentially lead to sensitive information being disclosed or modified.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `srctop_file` function should be modified to properly sanitize the file name and prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a library that provides safe file path manipulation, such as `Path::Tiny`. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all file paths are properly validated and sanitized to prevent similar attacks.  The `srctop_file` function is used in multiple places in the code, so it's essential to address this vulnerability to prevent potential attacks.  It's also recommended to use a more secure way to construct file
