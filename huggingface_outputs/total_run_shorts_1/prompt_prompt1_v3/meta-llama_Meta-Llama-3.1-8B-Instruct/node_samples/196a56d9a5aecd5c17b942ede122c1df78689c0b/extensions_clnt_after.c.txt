VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a constant time comparison in the `tls_valid_group` function not being used consistently throughout the code.
EXPLANATION: The `tls_valid_group` function is called with the same parameters multiple times, but the comparison is not done consistently. In the first call, the comparison is done with `TLS1_3_VERSION` as the version, but in the subsequent calls, the comparison is done with `TLS1_3_VERSION` as the version again. This inconsistency can lead to a timing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the comparison should be done consistently throughout the code. The `tls_valid_group` function should be called with the same parameters in all cases, and the comparison should be done using a constant time comparison function. For example, the `BN_bn2le` function can be used to convert the version to a byte string and then compare it using the `BN_cmp` function. This will ensure that the comparison is done consistently and prevent a timing attack.
