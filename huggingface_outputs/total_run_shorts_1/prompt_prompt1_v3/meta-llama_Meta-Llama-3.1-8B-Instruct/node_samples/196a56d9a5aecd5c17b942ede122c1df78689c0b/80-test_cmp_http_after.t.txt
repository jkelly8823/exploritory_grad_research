VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition when killing a mock server. The kill function is called before the waitpid function, which means that the process may not have been terminated yet when waitpid is called. This can lead to a zombie process.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the kill function is asynchronous, meaning it does not block until the process has been terminated. The waitpid function, on the other hand, blocks until the process has been terminated. By calling kill before waitpid, the code is vulnerable to a race condition where the process may not have been terminated yet when waitpid is called. This can lead to a zombie process.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to call waitpid before kill. This will ensure that the process is terminated before attempting to wait for it to terminate. Alternatively, the code could use the waitpid function with the WNOHANG option to check if the process has been terminated without blocking. This would allow the code to continue executing without waiting for the process to terminate. 

Note: The code is written in perl, and the kill function is used
