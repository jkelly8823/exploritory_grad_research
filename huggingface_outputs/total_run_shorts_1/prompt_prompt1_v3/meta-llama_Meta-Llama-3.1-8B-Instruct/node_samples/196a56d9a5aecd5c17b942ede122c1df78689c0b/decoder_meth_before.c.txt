VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the code. The `get_tmp_decoder_store` function is called with a pointer to `store` which is then used in the `get_decoder_from_store` function. However, if `get_tmp_decoder_store` fails to allocate memory, the `store` pointer will be invalid, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `get_tmp_decoder_store` function is called with a pointer to `store` which is then used in the `get_decoder_from_store` function. However, if `get_tmp_decoder_store` fails to allocate memory, the `store` pointer will be invalid, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the `store` pointer is not checked for validity before being used in the `get_decoder_from_store` function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `get_tmp_decoder_store` to ensure that memory was allocated successfully before passing the `store` pointer to `get_decoder_from_store`. This can be done by adding a check for the return value of `get_tmp_decoder_store` and returning an error
