VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is present in the line where the `mkdef` variable is being executed. The `mkdef` variable is being passed as a string to the Perl interpreter, which can lead to command injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `mkdef` variable to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `mkdef` variable should be sanitized or validated to prevent any malicious input. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the input or by using a library that provides input sanitization. Additionally, the use of the `PERL` variable directly in the command should be avoided, and instead, a safer way to execute the command should be used, such as using the `system` function with proper error handling. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that any user-input variables are properly sanitized and validated throughout the script.  The use of `PERL` directly in the command is also a security risk, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. The code should be modified to use a safer way to
