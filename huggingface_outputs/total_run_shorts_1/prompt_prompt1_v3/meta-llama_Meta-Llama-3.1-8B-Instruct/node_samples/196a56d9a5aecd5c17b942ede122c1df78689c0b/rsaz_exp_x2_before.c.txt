VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The issue arises from the fact that the out_str pointer is incremented by 6 and 7 bytes in each iteration, but the size of the out array is not checked. This allows an attacker to potentially write beyond the bounds of the out array, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a pointer arithmetic approach to process the input data. However, the increment of the out_str pointer is not properly synchronized with the size of the out array. This can lead to a situation where the out_str pointer points to an address outside the bounds of the out array, causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly check the bounds of the out array before incrementing the out_str pointer. This can be achieved by keeping track of the current index of the out array and checking if it is within the valid range before accessing the array. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all pointer arithmetic operations are properly synchronized with the size of the arrays involved. 

Note: The code is using a custom data type BN
