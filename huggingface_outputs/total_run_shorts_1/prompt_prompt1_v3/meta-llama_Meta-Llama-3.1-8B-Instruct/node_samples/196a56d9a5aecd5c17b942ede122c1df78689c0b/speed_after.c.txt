VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the outlen variable. This can be exploited by an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_derive function is called with the outlen variable as a pointer to a size_t. However, the outlen variable is assigned a value of MAX_FFDH_SIZE without any bounds checking. This means that if an attacker can manipulate the value of MAX_FFDH_SIZE, they can cause the EVP_PKEY_derive function to write data to the stack beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking on the outlen variable before passing it to the EVP_PKEY_derive function. This can be done by checking if the value of outlen is within a valid range before calling the function. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer function that does not allow for buffer overflows, such as EVP_PKEY_derive2.
