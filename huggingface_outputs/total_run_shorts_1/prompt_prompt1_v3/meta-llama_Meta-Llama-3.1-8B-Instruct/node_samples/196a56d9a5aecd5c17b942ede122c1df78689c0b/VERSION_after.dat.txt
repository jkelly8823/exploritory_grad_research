VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a simple configuration file, defining various constants for a project. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, such as user input handling, database queries, or network communication. The variables defined in this snippet are all string or integer values, and do not appear to be used in any way that could compromise security.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that sensitive information, such as the RELEASE_DATE, is not hardcoded in the code. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve this information.  Additionally, consider using a more robust method to handle versioning, such as using a semantic versioning library.  Finally, consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve the BUILD_METADATA, such as using an environment variable or a secure storage mechanism.  However, these are general recommendations and not specific to this code snippet.  The code snippet itself is secure.  The code snippet itself is secure
