VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists when the EVP_MD_free function is called on a null pointer.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_MD_free function is called on ctx->fetched_digest, which is set to NULL after the if statement. This is a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability because EVP_MD_free will attempt to free a null pointer, which is undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Before calling EVP_MD_free, check if ctx->fetched_digest is not NULL to prevent the null pointer dereference. The corrected code should be: if (ctx->fetched_digest!= NULL) EVP_MD_free(ctx->fetched_digest); ctx->fetched_digest = NULL; .
