VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect handling of the length of the AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability where the length of the AAD buffer is not properly checked, leading to a potential buffer overflow. The line `len = buf[aad_len - 2] << 8 | buf[aad_len - 1];` assumes that the last two bytes of the AAD buffer contain the length of the buffer, but it does not check if this length is valid. If the length is greater than the actual length of the AAD buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow when the code attempts to access `buf[len]`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the calculated length is valid before accessing the buffer. This can be done by checking if `len` is less than or equal to `aad_len`. If it is not, the code should return an error or handle the situation accordingly. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer way to handle the length of the AAD buffer, such as using a separate variable to store the length.
