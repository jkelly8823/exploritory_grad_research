 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential FIPS mode bypass. The variable $no_fips is set to 0 if the environment variable NO_FIPS is not set, which could potentially allow a user to bypass FIPS mode by setting this environment variable.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if FIPS mode is disabled by checking the value of the $no_fips variable. However, this variable is set to 0 if the environment variable NO_FIPS is not set, which could potentially allow a user to bypass FIPS mode by setting this environment variable. This is a security vulnerability because FIPS mode is intended to provide an additional layer of security for sensitive applications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to set $no_fips to 1 by default, and then check if the environment variable NO_FIPS is set to 0. This would ensure that FIPS mode is only disabled if the user explicitly sets the environment variable to 0. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all other potential vulnerabilities are addressed.  The code should also be tested to ensure that it behaves as expected in both F
