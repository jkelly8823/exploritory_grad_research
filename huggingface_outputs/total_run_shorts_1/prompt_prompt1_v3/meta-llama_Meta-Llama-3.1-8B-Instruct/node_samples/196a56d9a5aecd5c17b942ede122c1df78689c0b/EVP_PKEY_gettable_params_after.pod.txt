VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the lack of BN_free() call before BN_clear_free() call.
EXPLANATION: BN_clear_free() is used to free the memory allocated by BN_new() and BN_set_word(). However, BN_clear_free() does not free the memory allocated by BN_set_bit() and BN_set_bit1(). Therefore, if BN_set_bit() or BN_set_bit1() is used before BN_clear_free(), it will cause a memory leak. In this code, BN_set_bit() is used before BN_clear_free(), which will cause a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Move BN_free() call before BN_clear_free() call to prevent memory leak. The corrected code should be: BN_free(bn_priv); BN_clear_free(bn_priv);.
