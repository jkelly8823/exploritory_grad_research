 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the signer's certificate is not found in the trusted certificate store, which can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.
EXPLANATION: The code searches for the signer's certificate in the trusted certificate store, but it does not check if the certificate is actually present in the store. This can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker can intercept the communication and replace the signer's certificate with a fake one.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the signer's certificate is present in the trusted certificate store before attempting to verify the signature. This can be done by using the X509_STORE_add_cert() function to add the signer's certificate to the trusted store before verifying the signature. Additionally, the code should also check the validity of the signer's certificate before using it to verify the signature. This can be done by using the X509_verify_cert() function to verify the certificate's validity. ```c
X509_STORE_add_cert(store, signer_cert);
if (!X509_verify_cert(store, signer_cert)) {
    // Handle error
}
``` ```c
