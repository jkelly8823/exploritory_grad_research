 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains several potential vulnerabilities, including the use of internal pointers that must not be freed after use, and the lack of error handling for certain functions.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Specifically, the X509_CRL_get0_by_serial() function sets *ret to the internal pointer of the matching entry, which must not be freed after the call. Similarly, the X509_CRL_add0_revoked() function appends revoked entry rev to CRL crl, and the pointer rev is used internally so it must not be freed up after the call.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Additionally, the X509_REVOKED_set_serialNumber() and X509_REVOKED_set_revocationDate() functions take pointers to serial number and revocation date, respectively, but do not use them internally, and the supplied pointers should be freed up after use.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Furthermore, the X509_CRL_sort() function sorts the revoked entries of crl into ascending serial number order, but does not handle errors that may occur during sorting.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Finally, the X509_CRL_get_REVOKED() function returns
