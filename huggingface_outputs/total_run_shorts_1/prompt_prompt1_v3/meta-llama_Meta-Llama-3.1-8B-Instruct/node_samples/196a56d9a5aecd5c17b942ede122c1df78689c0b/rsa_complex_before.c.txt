 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a header guard for OpenSSL, checking for the presence of the C99 standard and including the complex.h header if it is available. It then includes the OpenSSL RSA header and the standard library. The main function is defined, but it does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be a safe and standard header guard. However, it is worth noting that the comment at the top of the file mentions a potential conflict between complex.h and openssl/rsa.h, but this is not a vulnerability in the code itself. It is rather a note about a potential issue that may arise when using these headers together.  The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
