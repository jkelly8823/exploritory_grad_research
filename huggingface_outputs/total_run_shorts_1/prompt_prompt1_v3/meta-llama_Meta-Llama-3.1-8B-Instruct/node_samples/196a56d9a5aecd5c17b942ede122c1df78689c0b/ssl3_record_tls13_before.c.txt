VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH which is a constant that can be modified. This can lead to a buffer overflow when writing to the iv array.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH constant is used to determine the size of the iv array. However, this constant can be modified, allowing an attacker to increase the size of the iv array beyond its intended size. When writing to the iv array, this can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a fixed-size array for the iv variable instead of relying on the EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH constant. This can be done by replacing the line "unsigned char iv[EVP_MAX_IV_LENGTH]" with "unsigned char iv[16]" or a similar fixed size. Additionally, consider using a safer method for determining the size of the iv array, such as using a function that returns the actual size of the iv array.  Also, consider using a safer method for writing to the iv array, such as using a function that checks for buffer overflows.  Finally, consider using a
