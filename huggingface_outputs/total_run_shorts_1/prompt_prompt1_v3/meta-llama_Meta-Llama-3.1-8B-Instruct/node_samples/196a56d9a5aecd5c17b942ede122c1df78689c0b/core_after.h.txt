VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a variable-length string in the `put` function without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `put` function takes a variable-length string as its fifth argument, but it does not perform any bounds checking on this string. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the `put` function to ensure that the length of the string does not exceed the allocated buffer size. This can be done by using a function like `strncpy` with a maximum length, or by using a safer string library like `strsafe`. Additionally, consider using a safer function like `snprintf` to prevent buffer overflows.
