VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a public key, likely used for cryptographic purposes. However, it is not a vulnerability in the code itself, but rather a potential security risk if the key is exposed or compromised.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet is a public key, which is a string of hexadecimal digits representing a cryptographic key. While it is not a vulnerability in the code, it is a potential security risk if the key is exposed or compromised. This is because a compromised public key can be used to compromise the corresponding private key, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to store the public key securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure key management system. Additionally, ensure that the key is not exposed in the code or in any other publicly accessible location. Consider using a secure key exchange protocol, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to establish a secure connection. Finally, regularly review and update the key to ensure it remains secure.  ```bash
