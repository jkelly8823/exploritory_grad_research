VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the lack of error checking for the EVP_PKEY_generate function. If EVP_PKEY_generate fails, the EVP_PKEY_CTX_free function will be called, but the EVP_PKEY_free function will not be called, resulting in a memory leak.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_generate function can fail and return a negative value. However, the code does not check for this failure and will attempt to free the EVP_PKEY_CTX and EVP_PKEY pointers without checking if they are valid. This can lead to a memory leak if EVP_PKEY_generate fails.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add error checking for the EVP_PKEY_generate function and free the EVP_PKEY pointer if it fails. This can be done by checking the return value of EVP_PKEY_generate and freeing the EVP_PKEY pointer if it is negative. For example: if (EVP_PKEY_generate(gctx, &key) < 0) { EVP_PKEY_free(key); key = NULL; } else { /* rest of the code */ } This will ensure that the EVP_PKEY pointer is freed if EVP_PKEY_generate
