 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of deprecated functions. The functions CRYPTO_mem_leaks(), CRYPTO_mem_leaks_fp(), CRYPTO_mem_leaks_cb(), CRYPTO_set_mem_debug(), and CRYPTO_mem_ctrl() are deprecated and return -1. Similarly, the functions OPENSSL_mem_debug_push(), OPENSSL_mem_debug_pop(), CRYPTO_mem_debug_push(), and CRYPTO_mem_debug_pop() are deprecated and return 0.
EXPLANATION: The use of deprecated functions can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to replace these functions with their modern counterparts to ensure the code remains secure and maintainable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the deprecated functions with their modern counterparts. For example, instead of using CRYPTO_mem_leaks(), use the modern equivalent. Similarly, instead of using OPENSSL_mem_debug_push(), use the modern equivalent. This will ensure that the code remains secure and maintainable. Additionally, consider updating the code to use the latest OpenSSL version to take advantage of the latest security features and bug fixes.  ```bash
OPENSSL_malloc_fd=3
