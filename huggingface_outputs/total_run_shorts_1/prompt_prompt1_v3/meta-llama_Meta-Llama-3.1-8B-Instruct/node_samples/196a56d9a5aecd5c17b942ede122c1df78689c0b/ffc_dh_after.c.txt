VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the keylength parameter in the FFC_PARAMS struct.
EXPLANATION: The FFC_PARAMS struct contains a keylength field which is assigned the value of the keylength field from the DH_NAMED_GROUP struct without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by setting the keylength to a value larger than the actual buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the keylength parameter in the FFC_PARAMS struct to ensure that it does not exceed the actual buffer size. This can be done by checking the value of keylength against the size of the buffer and returning an error if it exceeds the maximum allowed value. Additionally, consider using a safer data type such as uint32_t or size_t to represent the keylength to prevent overflows.
