 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a cryptographic library, and it seems to be implementing various tests for encryption and decryption functionality. The code is well-structured and follows a clear logic flow. There are no obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The use of FIPS module is also properly handled with conditional compilation directives.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is always a good practice to regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest security standards. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation and error handling to further enhance the security of the code.  ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
