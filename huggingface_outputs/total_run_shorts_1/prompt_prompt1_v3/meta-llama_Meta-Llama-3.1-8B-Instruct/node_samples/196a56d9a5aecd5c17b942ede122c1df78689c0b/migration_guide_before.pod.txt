 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability in the form of a deprecated function call. The functions BN_is_prime_ex() and BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex() are being used, which are deprecated and may lead to incorrect results. 
EXPLANATION: The functions BN_is_prime_ex() and BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex() are deprecated and should not be used. They may lead to incorrect results due to possible misuse. The recommended function to use is BN_check_prime(), which always uses at least 64 rounds of the Miller-Rabin primality test.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the deprecated function calls with the recommended function BN_check_prime(). For example, replace BN_is_prime_ex() with BN_check_prime(). Make sure to pass the correct parameters to the function.  ```perl
if (BN_is_prime_ex($bn, 1, NULL, NULL)) {
    # code
}
```
should be replaced with
```perl
if (BN_check_prime($bn, 64)) {
    # code
}
``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
