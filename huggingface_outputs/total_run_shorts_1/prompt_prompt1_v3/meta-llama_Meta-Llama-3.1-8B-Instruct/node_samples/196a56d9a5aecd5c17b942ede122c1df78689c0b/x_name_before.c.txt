 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the X509_NAME_print function. The function does not properly check the length of the buffer before writing to it, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The X509_NAME_print function is designed to print the contents of an X509_NAME structure to a BIO stream. However, the function does not properly check the length of the buffer before writing to it. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists in the lines where the function writes to the buffer without checking its length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to properly check the length of the buffer before writing to it. This can be done by using the BIO_write function with the correct length parameter. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle errors properly, such as checking the return value of BIO_write and handling any errors that may occur. The corrected code should look something like this: if (BIO_write(bp, ", ", 2)!= 2) { OPENSSL_free(b); return 0; } ``` VUL
