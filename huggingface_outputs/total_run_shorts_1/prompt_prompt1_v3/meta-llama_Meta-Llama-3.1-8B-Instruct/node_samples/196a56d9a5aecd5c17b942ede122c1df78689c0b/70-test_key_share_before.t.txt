VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the $proxy->serverflags() method. This method is called with user-controlled input, which can lead to a potential DoS attack if the input is crafted maliciously.
EXPLANATION: The $proxy->serverflags() method is called with the string "-groups P-256" which is user-controlled input. This input is not validated or sanitized, which means an attacker could potentially craft a malicious input that would cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. This is a classic example of a DoS attack vector.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input to the $proxy->serverflags() method. This can be done by using a regular expression to ensure that the input only contains valid characters and does not exceed a certain length. Additionally, the code should also consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, known-good inputs to the method. This would prevent any malicious input from being processed.
