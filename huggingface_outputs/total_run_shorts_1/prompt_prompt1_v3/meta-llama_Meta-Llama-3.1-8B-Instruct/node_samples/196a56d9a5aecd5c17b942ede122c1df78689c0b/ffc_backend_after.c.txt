VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. If prm->data is null, then the code will attempt to access the memory location pointed to by prm->data, resulting in a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code does not check if prm->data is null before attempting to access it. This is a classic example of a null pointer dereference vulnerability. The code snippet is also missing a corresponding else statement after the if condition, which could lead to the code skipping the intended execution path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if prm->data is null before attempting to access it. This can be done by adding a null check before the if condition. Additionally, the code should be modified to include a corresponding else statement after the if condition to ensure that the intended execution path is followed. The corrected code should look like this: if (prm->data!= NULL && prm->data_type!= OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING ||...). The corrected code should also handle the case where prm->data is null by either returning an error or skipping the intended execution
