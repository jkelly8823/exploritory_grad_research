VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the eivlen variable.
EXPLANATION: The code does not check if the eivlen variable is within the valid range before using it to access the IV. This can lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker can manipulate the eivlen variable to be larger than the actual IV length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check if the eivlen variable is within the valid range before using it to access the IV. This can be done by checking if eivlen is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the actual IV length. If it is not within the valid range, an error should be returned. For example: if (eivlen < 0 || eivlen > EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(s->enc_write_ctx)) { SSLfatal(s, SSL_AD_INTERNAL_ERROR, SSL_R_LIBRARY_BUG); goto err; } ``` ```
