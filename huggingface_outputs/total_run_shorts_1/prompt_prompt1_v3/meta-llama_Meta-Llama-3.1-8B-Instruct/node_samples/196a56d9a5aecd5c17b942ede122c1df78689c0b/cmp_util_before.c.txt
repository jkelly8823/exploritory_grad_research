VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of OPENSSL_strndup() without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The OPENSSL_strndup() function is used to allocate memory for a string, but it does not perform bounds checking on the input. This means that if the input string is longer than the allocated buffer, it can overflow the buffer and potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. In this case, the function is used to allocate memory for the file path, but the input string is not checked for bounds before being passed to OPENSSL_strndup(). This makes it vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input string before passing it to OPENSSL_strndup(). This can be done by using the strnlen() function to get the length of the string, and then checking if it is within the bounds of the allocated buffer. If it is not, the code should either allocate more memory or handle the error accordingly. Additionally, consider using a safer function like OPENSSL_strdup() which does bounds checking internally.
