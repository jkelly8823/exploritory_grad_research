 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the millis parameter.
EXPLANATION: The ossl_sleep function does not check if the millis parameter exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an unsigned long. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if a large value is passed to the function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to the ossl_sleep function to ensure that the millis parameter does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in an unsigned long. This can be done by checking if millis is greater than the maximum value and returning an error or handling the situation accordingly. For example: if (millis > ULONG_MAX) { /* handle error */ } .
