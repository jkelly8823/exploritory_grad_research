 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the ASN1_OCTET_STRING_free function.
EXPLANATION: The ASN1_OCTET_STRING_free function is called without checking if the input pointer is NULL or not. If a NULL pointer is passed to this function, it will cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a NULL check before calling the ASN1_OCTET_STRING_free function. For example: if (ip2!= NULL) ASN1_OCTET_STRING_free(ip2);. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability from occurring. Additionally, consider using a safer function like OPENSSL_free to free the memory. 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the return statement.
EXPLANATION: The return statement is called without checking if the testresult variable is NULL or not. If a NULL pointer is passed to this function, it will cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability.
