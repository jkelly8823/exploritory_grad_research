 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential OpenSSL vulnerability due to the use of the FIPS provider for decoding. The FIPS provider is not designed for general-purpose use and can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the FIPS provider for decoding, which is not recommended for general-purpose use. The FIPS provider is designed for use in FIPS-compliant environments and can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues when used in non-FIPS environments. This can lead to vulnerabilities in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should use the default OpenSSL provider for decoding instead of the FIPS provider. This can be achieved by removing the FIPS provider from the OpenSSL configuration or by using a different provider that is designed for general-purpose use. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not using any other FIPS-specific features that may lead to vulnerabilities.  VULNERABLE: YES
