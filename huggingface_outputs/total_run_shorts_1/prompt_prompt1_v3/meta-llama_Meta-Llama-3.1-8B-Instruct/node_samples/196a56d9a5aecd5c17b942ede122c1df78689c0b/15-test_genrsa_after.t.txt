VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `run` function without proper error handling. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the program to crash.
EXPLANATION: The `run` function is used to execute external commands, but it does not provide any error handling or validation. This means that if an attacker provides a malicious command, it could be executed without any checks, potentially leading to a DoS attack. Additionally, the use of the `app` function to build the command to be executed may not be properly sanitized, which could also lead to a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle errors and validate the input to the `run` function. This could be done by using a more secure method of executing external commands, such as using a library that provides error handling and validation. Additionally, the `app` function should be modified to properly sanitize its input to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.
