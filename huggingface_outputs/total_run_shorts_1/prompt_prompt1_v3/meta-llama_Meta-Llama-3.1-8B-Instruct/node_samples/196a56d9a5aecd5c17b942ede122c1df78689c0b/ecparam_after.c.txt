VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey function returns a pointer to an EVP_PKEY_CTX structure, which can be NULL if the function fails. However, the code does not check for this possibility before using the returned pointer to access the EVP_PKEY_CTX structure.
EXPLANATION: The EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey function can fail and return NULL if the underlying cryptographic operation fails. However, the code does not check for this possibility before using the returned pointer to access the EVP_PKEY_CTX structure. This can lead to a null pointer dereference, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey to ensure that it is not NULL before using the returned pointer to access the EVP_PKEY_CTX structure. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check for NULL before using the pointer. For example: if (gctx_key == NULL) {... } else {... } This will prevent the null pointer
