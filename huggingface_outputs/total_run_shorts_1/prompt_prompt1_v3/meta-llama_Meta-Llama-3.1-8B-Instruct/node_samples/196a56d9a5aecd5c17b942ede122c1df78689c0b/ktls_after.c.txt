VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() without checking the return value. This function can return a negative value, which is not checked before assigning it to crypto_info->iv_len.
EXPLANATION: EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() can return a negative value if the cipher context is not properly initialized or if there is an error in the cipher context. However, the code does not check the return value before assigning it to crypto_info->iv_len. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if the return value is negative.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() before assigning it to crypto_info->iv_len. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the return value is negative. If it is, an error should be returned or handled accordingly. For example: if (crypto_info->iv_len < 0) { return 0; } else { crypto_info->iv_len = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(dd); } This will prevent the potential buffer overflow attack. Additionally, it
