VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the `cipher_list` array.
EXPLANATION: The `cipher_list` array is being accessed with an index `testidx` without any bounds checking. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if `testidx` is greater than or equal to the size of the `cipher_list` array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that `testidx` is within the valid range of the `cipher_list` array. This can be done by checking if `testidx` is less than the size of the `cipher_list` array before accessing it. For example: `if (testidx < sizeof(cipher_list) / sizeof(cipher_list[0])) {... }`. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure such as a vector or a list to store the cipher list, which would eliminate the need for manual bounds checking.  ```c
if (testidx < sizeof(cipher_list) / sizeof(cipher_list[0])) {
    TEST_info("Starting #%d, %s", testidx, cipher_list[testidx]);
}
``` ```c
