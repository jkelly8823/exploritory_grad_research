VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the function evp_kem_get_number. The function does not check the length of the kem->name_id string before passing it to the evp_is_a function, which may lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long.
EXPLANATION: The evp_is_a function is called with the kem->name_id string as an argument, but the function does not check the length of the string before passing it to evp_is_a. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the string is too long, as evp_is_a may not be able to handle strings of arbitrary length.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function evp_kem_get_number should be modified to check the length of the kem->name_id string before passing it to evp_is_a. This can be done by using the strlen function to get the length of the string and then checking if it is within a safe range. If the string is too long, an error should be returned. For example: if (strlen(kem->name_id) > MAX_SAFE_STRING_LENGTH) { return -1;
