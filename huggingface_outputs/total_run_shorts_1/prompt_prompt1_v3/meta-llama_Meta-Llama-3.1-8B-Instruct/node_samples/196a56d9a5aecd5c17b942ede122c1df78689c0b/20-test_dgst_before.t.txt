VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of a regular expression match operation ($xofdata[1] =~ $expected) which can be slow and may leak information about the secret key.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression match operation can be slow because it has to scan the entire string to find a match. This can be exploited by an attacker to determine the secret key by measuring the time it takes for the operation to complete. This is a classic example of a timing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a constant-time comparison function instead of a regular expression match operation. One possible solution is to use the eq operator to compare the two strings, like this: ok($xofdata[1] eq $expected, "XOF: Check second digest value is consistent with the first ($xofdata[1]) vs ($expected)");. This will ensure that the comparison is done in constant time, regardless of the input values. Another solution is to use a library that provides a constant-time comparison function, such as the "constant-time" module in Perl.  Additionally, the
