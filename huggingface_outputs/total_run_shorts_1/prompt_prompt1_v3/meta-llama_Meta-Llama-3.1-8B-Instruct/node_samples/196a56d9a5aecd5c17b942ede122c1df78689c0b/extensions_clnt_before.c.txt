 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of the time() function to calculate the age of the session. This allows an attacker to determine the time it takes to perform certain operations, potentially revealing sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The time() function returns the current time in seconds since the epoch, which can be used to calculate the age of the session. However, this function is not constant time, meaning that the time it takes to execute can vary depending on the system load and other factors. This allows an attacker to measure the time it takes to perform certain operations, such as checking if a certain group is allowed, and use this information to determine the age of the session. This can be used to launch a timing attack, potentially revealing sensitive information such as the session key.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a constant-time function to calculate the age of the session, such as the get_time() function from the OpenSSL library. This function returns the current time in seconds since the epoch, but is designed to be constant time, making it more secure against timing attacks. Additionally, the code should
