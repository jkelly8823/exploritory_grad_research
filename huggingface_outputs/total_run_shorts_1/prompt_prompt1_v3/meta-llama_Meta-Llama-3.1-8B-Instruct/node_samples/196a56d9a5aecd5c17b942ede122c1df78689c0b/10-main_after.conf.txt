 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of hardcoded paths and flags in the configuration. This can lead to issues if the code is deployed on a different system or environment.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded paths and flags, such as "linux-latomic", "linux-generic64", and "/W3 /wd4090 /nologo". These hardcoded values can cause issues if the code is deployed on a different system or environment, as they may not be valid or may not work as expected. Additionally, the use of hardcoded paths and flags can make the code more difficult to maintain and debug.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use environment variables or configuration files to store the paths and flags. This will allow the code to be more flexible and adaptable to different environments. For example, the code could use the "PERLASM_SCHEME" environment variable to determine the perlasm scheme, rather than hardcoding it. Similarly, the code could use a configuration file to store the paths and flags, rather than hardcoding them. This will make the code more maintainable
