 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a series of YAML comments documenting changes to the Node.js project.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet consists of multiple YAML comments, each containing information about changes made to the Node.js project. The comments are structured in a specific format, with fields such as `added`, `changes`, and `version`. The presence of these comments does not indicate any vulnerability in the code itself, but rather provides metadata about the project's history.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as this code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities. However, it is recommended to ensure that the YAML comments are properly formatted and consistent throughout the project. This will help maintain the integrity and readability of the project's history.  ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
