VULNERABLE_LINES: 23
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of StringPrototypeSplit with a comma and space as the separator. This can lead to catastrophic backtracking if the input string contains a large number of commas.
EXPLANATION: The StringPrototypeSplit function is used with a comma and space as the separator, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking if the input string contains a large number of commas. This can cause the function to take an excessive amount of time to complete, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust regular expression as the separator, such as one that uses a possessive quantifier to prevent backtracking. For example, you can use the following regular expression: /, +/g. This will split the string on one or more commas, preventing catastrophic backtracking. Alternatively, you can use a simple string split function, such as StringPrototypeSplit(','). This will also prevent catastrophic backtracking. However, keep in mind that this may not be suitable for all use cases, as it will not split on multiple consecutive commas.
