VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44532, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code by exploiting the incorrect assumption that it is safe to split the subject alternative name property at the two-character sequence `', '`.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it incorrectly assumes that it is safe to split the subject alternative name property at the two-character sequence `', '`. This assumption is incorrect because malicious and legitimate certificates can contain subject alternative names that include this sequence when represented as a string. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious certificate that includes a subject alternative name with the sequence `', '`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle both possible entry formats for the subject alternative name property, including JSON string literals and non-JSON string literals. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to split the property at the correct delimiter, rather than relying on the incorrect assumption that it is safe to split at the two-character sequence `', '`. Additionally, the code should be updated to handle the case where the subject alternative name property is a JSON string literal, by parsing the JSON
