 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the function SafeX509ExtPrint() returns a boolean value, but the code does not check if the function call was successful before proceeding. If SafeX509ExtPrint() returns false, the code will attempt to call X509V3_EXT_print() on a null pointer, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that SafeX509ExtPrint() returns a boolean value, but the code does not check if the function call was successful before proceeding. This is a common pitfall in C++ programming, where the return value of a function is not checked, leading to unexpected behavior. In this case, if SafeX509ExtPrint() returns false, the code will attempt to call X509V3_EXT_print() on a null pointer, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of SafeX509ExtPrint() before proceeding. If SafeX509ExtPrint() returns false, the code should handle the error accordingly, rather
