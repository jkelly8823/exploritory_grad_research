The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS).
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and well-written. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it aligns with the project's security guidelines and best practices. Additionally, consider using a linter or code analyzer to catch any potential issues that may not be immediately apparent.  ```
