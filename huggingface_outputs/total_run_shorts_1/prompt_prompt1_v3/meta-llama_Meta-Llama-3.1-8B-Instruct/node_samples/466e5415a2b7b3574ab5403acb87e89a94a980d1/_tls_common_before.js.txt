VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of a regular expression with the 'g' flag without proper validation of the input string. This could lead to catastrophic backtracking and denial of service attacks.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the StringPrototypeReplace function has the 'g' flag, which allows it to match all occurrences in the string. However, if the input string is very large or contains a large number of matches, the regular expression engine may enter an infinite loop, causing the program to hang or crash. This is known as catastrophic backtracking. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input string that causes the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the input string before passing it to the regular expression. You can do this by checking the length of the string and ensuring it is within a reasonable limit. Additionally, you can use a more efficient regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the'regex' module, which is designed to handle large input strings and prevent catastrophic backtracking. You should also consider using a more robust validation mechanism, such
