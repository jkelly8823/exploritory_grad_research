VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression with a large number of possible matches in the `jsonStringPattern` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `jsonStringPattern` regular expression is used to match valid JSON string literals. However, it contains a large number of possible matches, including Unicode escape sequences, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking and a denial of service attack. This is particularly problematic because the regular expression is used to parse the subject alt names string, which can be arbitrary and potentially malicious input.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more restrictive regular expression that only matches a subset of valid JSON string literals. Alternatively, consider using a dedicated JSON parsing library that is designed to handle malicious input safely. Additionally, consider adding input validation and sanitization to ensure that the subject alt names string is well-formed and does not contain any malicious characters. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the `jsonStringPattern` regular expression, which is used to match valid JSON string literals. The regular expression is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking due to the use
