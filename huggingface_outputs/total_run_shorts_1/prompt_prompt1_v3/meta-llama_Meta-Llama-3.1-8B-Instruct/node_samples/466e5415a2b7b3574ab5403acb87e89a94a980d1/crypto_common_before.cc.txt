VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the `GetInfoString` function is called with a potentially null `bio` pointer.
EXPLANATION: The `GetInfoString` function is called with a potentially null `bio` pointer. If `bio` is null, the function will return null, and the subsequent call to `Set<Value>` will dereference the null pointer, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `bio` pointer should be checked for null before calling `GetInfoString`. If it is null, an error should be returned instead of attempting to dereference it. For example: `if (bio!= nullptr) {... } else { return MaybeLocal<Object>(); }`. Additionally, the `GetInfoString` function should be modified to handle null pointers properly.
