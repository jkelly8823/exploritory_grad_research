 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the use of a function expression as a property value in the E function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The E function is using a function expression as a property value, which can lead to a memory leak. This is because the function expression is not being properly garbage collected, and the reference to it is being held by the E function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function expression should be replaced with a function declaration. This will ensure that the function is properly garbage collected and will prevent the potential memory leak. For example, the line `E('ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID', function(reason, host, cert) {... });` should be replaced with `E('ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID', function ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID(reason, host, cert) {... });`. This will ensure that the function is properly garbage collected and will prevent the potential memory leak. 

Note: The function expression is being used as a property value in the E function, which is
