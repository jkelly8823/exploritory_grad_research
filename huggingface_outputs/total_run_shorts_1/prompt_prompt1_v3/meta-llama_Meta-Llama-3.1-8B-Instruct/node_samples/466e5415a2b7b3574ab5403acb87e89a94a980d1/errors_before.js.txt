 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the use of a function expression as a property value in the E function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The E function is being used to define error codes, but the function expression passed as the third argument is not properly bound to the context of the E function. This can cause the function expression to capture the wrong context, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. In this case, the function expression is capturing the global object, which can lead to a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function expression should be replaced with a function declaration or a function expression that is properly bound to the context of the E function. For example, the function expression could be replaced with a function declaration like this: function(reason, host, cert) {... }. Alternatively, the function expression could be replaced with a function expression that is properly bound to the context of the E function, like this: (function(reason, host, cert) {... }).call(this);.  This will ensure that the function expression is properly bound to the context
