VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential resource leak due to the lack of a close operation on the file descriptor.
EXPLANATION: The code opens a file descriptor using `DataQueue::CreateFdEntry` but does not close it. This can lead to a resource leak if an exception is thrown after the file is opened but before it is closed. The `THROW_ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE` function is called in this case, but it does not close the file descriptor.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a `close` operation on the file descriptor after it is opened but before any exceptions are thrown. This can be done by calling `entry->Close()` in a `try` block, and then re-throwing the exception if it is not null. For example: `try { entry->Close(); } catch (...) { if (entry!= nullptr) entry->Close(); }`. This ensures that the file descriptor is always closed, even if an exception is thrown.  Additionally, consider using a smart pointer or a RAII class to manage the file descriptor and ensure it is closed automatically when it goes out of scope.
