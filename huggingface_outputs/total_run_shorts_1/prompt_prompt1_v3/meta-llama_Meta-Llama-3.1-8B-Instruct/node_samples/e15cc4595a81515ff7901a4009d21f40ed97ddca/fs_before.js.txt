VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function `PromiseResolve` is not a standard JavaScript function. It seems to be a typo and should be `Promise.resolve`.
EXPLANATION:
The function `PromiseResolve` is not recognized by the JavaScript engine. This is likely due to a typo in the code. The correct function name is `Promise.resolve`. This function is used to wrap a value in a promise. It is commonly used to convert a value to a promise.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace `PromiseResolve` with `Promise.resolve` in the code. For example: `return Promise.resolve(createBlobFromFilePath(getValidatedPath(path), { type }));` 
```javascript
function getValidatedPath(path) {
  const validatedPath = path.replace(/\\/g, '/');
  return validatedPath;
}
```
