VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct concatenation of user input.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the `path.toNamespacedPath()` function to construct a path, but it directly concatenates the `blockedFile` variable, which could potentially be user input. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the `blockedFile` variable is used in a database query.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use the `?` placeholder in the SQL query and pass the `blockedFile` variable as a parameter. Alternatively, you can use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that supports parameterized queries. Additionally, ensure that the `blockedFile` variable is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any malicious input.  ```javascript
const sql = 'SELECT * FROM files WHERE path =?';
const params = [blockedFile];
db.query(sql, params, (err, results) => {
  //...
});
```  ```javascript
```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'username',
