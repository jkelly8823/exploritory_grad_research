VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of `fs.openAsBlob` without proper error handling. This can lead to an unhandled exception being thrown, causing the program to crash.
EXPLANATION: The `fs.openAsBlob` function is called without any error handling, which means that if the file system access is denied, the program will throw an unhandled exception. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, where an attacker can cause the program to crash by repeatedly attempting to access a file that they do not have permission to access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper error handling to the `fs.openAsBlob` function call. This can be done by wrapping the function call in a try-catch block and handling the error accordingly. For example: `try { fs.openAsBlob(blockedFile); } catch (err) { console.error(err); }`. Additionally, you should consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as a retry mechanism or a circuit breaker, to prevent the program from crashing in case of repeated
