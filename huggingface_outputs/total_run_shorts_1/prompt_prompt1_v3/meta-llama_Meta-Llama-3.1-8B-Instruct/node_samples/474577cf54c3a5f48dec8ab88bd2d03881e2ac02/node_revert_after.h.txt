VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to a macro expansion issue.
EXPLANATION: The SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro is defined with a variable number of arguments, but the V macro is not properly defined to handle this. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the macro is expanded.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the V macro should be defined to handle the variable number of arguments. This can be done by using a variadic macro or by using a different approach to define the enum reversion. For example, the V macro could be defined as follows: #define V(code,...) SECURITY_REVERT_##code = code. This would ensure that the macro expansion is safe and does not lead to a buffer overflow. Additionally, the SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro should be reviewed to ensure that it is properly handling the variable number of arguments.  ```c
#define SECURITY_REVERSIONS(XX)                                            \
  XX(CVE_2019_9514, "CVE-2019-9514", "HTTP/2 Reset Flood")                 \
