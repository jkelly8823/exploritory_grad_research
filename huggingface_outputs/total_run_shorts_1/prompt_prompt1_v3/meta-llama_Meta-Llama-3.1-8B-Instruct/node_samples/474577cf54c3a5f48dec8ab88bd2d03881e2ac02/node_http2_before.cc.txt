VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the code. The function Http2Stream::New(session, id, frame->headers.cat) returns a null pointer, which is then dereferenced in the line nghttp2_submit_rst_stream(**session, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, id, NGHTTP2_ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM);. This could lead to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if Http2Stream::New(session, id, frame->headers.cat) returns a null pointer, but it does not handle the case where it does return a null pointer. Instead of returning an error code or handling the null pointer, the code dereferences the null pointer, which could lead to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if Http2Stream::New(session, id, frame->headers.cat) returns a null pointer and handle it accordingly. This could be done by returning an error code or by handling the null pointer in a safe manner. For example, the code could check if the pointer is null before dereferencing it, and
