 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a network library, specifically handling HTTP/2 streams. It defines several vectors to store outgoing buffers, storage, and pending RST streams. It also includes a counter to track rejected streams. The functions `CopyDataIntoOutgoing` and `ClearOutgoing` are declared but not defined, which is not a vulnerability in itself. The code seems to be following standard practices for handling network streams and does not exhibit any obvious security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure as is. However, it would be beneficial to review the implementation of the `CopyDataIntoOutgoing` and `ClearOutgoing` functions to ensure they are correctly handling data and stream management. Additionally, consider adding input validation and error handling to prevent potential issues with the `rejected_stream_count_` counter.  Please note that this is not a vulnerability but a general recommendation.  The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
