VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of a rate limiting mechanism for concurrent stream openings. An attacker could potentially exploit this by opening an excessive number of streams, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the session can add a new stream and if the creation of a new stream fails, it increments the rejected stream count. However, it does not limit the number of times this can happen. An attacker could potentially exploit this by opening an excessive number of streams, leading to a denial of service. This is a known vulnerability (CVE-2019-9514) and the code checks if the revert flag is set to prevent exploitation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent excessive concurrent stream openings. This can be achieved by introducing a counter to track the number of stream openings within a certain time window and returning an error if the limit is exceeded. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to prevent the session from being reused after a certain number of rejections. This can be achieved by introducing a flag to indicate if the session is rejected and checking this flag before reusing the session
