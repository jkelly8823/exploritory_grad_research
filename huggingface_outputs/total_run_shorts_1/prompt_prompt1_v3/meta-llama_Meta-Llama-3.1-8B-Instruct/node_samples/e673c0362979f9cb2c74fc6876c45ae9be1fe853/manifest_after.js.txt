VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `internalVerifyIntegrity` function without proper error handling. If the `internalVerifyIntegrity` function returns an error, the code will continue to execute without checking the integrity of the remaining entries, potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack.
EXPLANATION: The `internalVerifyIntegrity` function is called without proper error handling, which means that if the function returns an error, the code will not properly check the integrity of the remaining entries. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker can manipulate the `content` or `expected` variables to cause the `internalVerifyIntegrity` function to return an error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle errors returned by the `internalVerifyIntegrity` function. This can be done by adding a try-catch block around the call to `internalVerifyIntegrity` and checking the return value for errors. If an error is returned, the code should exit the loop and return an error to the caller. Additionally,
