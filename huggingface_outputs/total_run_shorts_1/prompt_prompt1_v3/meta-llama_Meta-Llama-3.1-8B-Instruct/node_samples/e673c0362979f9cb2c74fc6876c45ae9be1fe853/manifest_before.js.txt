VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of timingSafeEqual function. This function is not secure against timing attacks and can be used to leak information about the contents of the digest.
EXPLANATION: The timingSafeEqual function is used to compare the digest with the expected digest. However, this function is not secure against timing attacks and can be used to leak information about the contents of the digest. This can be exploited by an attacker to determine the contents of the digest, which can be used to bypass the integrity check.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a secure comparison function such as crypto.timingSafeEqual() or crypto.timingSafeCompare() instead of timingSafeEqual. Alternatively, use a constant-time comparison function such as crypto.timingSafeEqual() with a large buffer size to make the comparison more secure. Additionally, consider using a secure hash function such as crypto.createHash('sha256') instead of crypto.createHash(algorithm) to generate the digest. 

Note: The lines 14-16 refer to the lines where the timingSafeEqual function is used.
