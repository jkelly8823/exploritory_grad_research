VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains two instances of a function that will always terminate with an abort() call, indicating a potential bug or logic error.
EXPLANATION: The presence of the /* UNREACHABLE */ comments and the abort() calls suggest that the code is attempting to handle an impossible or unexpected condition. This could be a sign of a logic error or a bug in the code. The abort() call will terminate the program immediately, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Review the code to determine why the abort() calls are necessary and consider alternative error handling mechanisms that do not terminate the program abruptly. Consider adding logging or other diagnostic mechanisms to help identify the root cause of the issue. Additionally, consider refactoring the code to remove the unreachable code blocks and simplify the logic.  ```bash
