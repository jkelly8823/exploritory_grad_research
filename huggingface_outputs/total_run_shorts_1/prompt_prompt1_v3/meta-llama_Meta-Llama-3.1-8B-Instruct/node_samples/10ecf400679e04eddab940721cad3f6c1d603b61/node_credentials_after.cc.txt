VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size array `cap_data` with a size of 2, which may not be sufficient to hold all the capability data. This can lead to a buffer overflow when `cap_data` is accessed at index 1.
EXPLANATION: The `cap_data` array is declared with a fixed size of 2, which is determined by the `arraysize(cap_data)` macro. However, the `capget` system call can return more than 2 capability data structures, leading to a potential buffer overflow when accessing `cap_data` at index 1. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the `cap_data` array should be dynamically allocated to match the number of capability data structures returned by the `capget` system call. This can be achieved by using a dynamically allocated array or a data structure that can handle variable-sized data. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all accesses to `cap_data
