VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The createExport function is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This is because it directly injects user input into the generated JavaScript code without any sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The createExport function takes a string parameter expt, which is then used to construct the name of a variable and an export statement. However, this input is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. For example, if an attacker passes the string "}; export { console.log('XSS') };" as the expt parameter, the generated code would include the malicious export statement, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the client-side.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the createExport function should validate and sanitize the expt parameter to prevent any malicious code from being injected. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library like DOMPurify to sanitize the input. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle errors and exceptions properly to prevent any unexpected behavior. ```javascript
function createExport(expt) {
  const allowedChars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ012345678
