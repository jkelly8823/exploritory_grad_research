VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The JSONStringify function is used to convert the expt parameter to a string, but it does not properly escape special characters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by providing a specially crafted string as the expt parameter.
EXPLANATION: The JSONStringify function is not designed to handle user input, and it does not properly escape special characters. This makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks. The code is using the JSONStringify function to convert the expt parameter to a string, which is then used as a property name in the import.meta.exports object. An attacker could provide a string that contains malicious code, which would be executed when the code is run.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a function that properly escapes special characters, such as the String function. You can replace the JSONStringify function with the String function to prevent XSS attacks. For example: const nameStringLit = String(expt);. Additionally, you should validate the input to ensure that it does not contain any malicious code. You can use a library like DOMP
