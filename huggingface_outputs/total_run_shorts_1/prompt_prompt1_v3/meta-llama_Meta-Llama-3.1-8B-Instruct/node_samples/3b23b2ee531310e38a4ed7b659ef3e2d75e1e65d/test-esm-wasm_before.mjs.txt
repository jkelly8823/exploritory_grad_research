 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the use of user-controlled input in the `code` variable without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The `code` variable is being used directly in a comparison without any checks or sanitization. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code or manipulate the comparison result by manipulating the `code` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate and sanitize the `code` variable before using it in the comparison. This can be done by using a library like DOMPurify or by implementing a custom validation function to ensure the input is safe. Additionally, consider using a more secure comparison method, such as using a whitelist of allowed values or using a secure comparison function like `strictEqualWithSanitization`. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is not XSS, but a potential issue with the use of user-controlled input in the `code` variable. The provided explanation and recommendations are based on the assumption that the `code` variable is user-controlled. If the `code` variable is not user-controlled, then the vulnerability is not present.
