VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to code injection attacks due to the use of `JSON.stringify()` to construct the import path. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating the import path.
EXPLANATION: The `JSON.stringify()` function is used to convert the file URL of the WASM module to a string, which is then used as the import path. However, this allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating the import path. For example, an attacker could inject a malicious module by providing a file URL that points to a malicious module.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to construct the import path, such as using a whitelist of allowed file URLs or using a secure library to parse the import path. One possible solution is to use the `path` module to construct the import path, like this: `import * as wasmExports from path.join(__dirname, 'es-modules/export-name-code-injection.wasm');`. This ensures that the import path is constructed in a secure manner and prevents code injection attacks. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not use any other insecure methods to
