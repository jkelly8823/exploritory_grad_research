 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. This is because the `child_process.spawnSync` function is used to execute the `autocannon` executable with user-provided input, without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The `child_process.spawnSync` function is used to execute the `autocannon` executable with the user-provided input from the `-h` flag. However, this input is not properly sanitized or validated, which allows an attacker to inject malicious commands. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to execute the executable, such as `child_process.execSync` or `child_process.exec`, which can be used to execute a command and capture its output. Additionally, the input should be properly sanitized and validated to prevent any malicious commands from being executed. For example, the code could use a whitelist approach to only allow specific flags and options to be executed. Alternatively, the code could use a library like `shell-quote` to properly quote and escape the input. ```javascript
const result = child_process.execSync(`
