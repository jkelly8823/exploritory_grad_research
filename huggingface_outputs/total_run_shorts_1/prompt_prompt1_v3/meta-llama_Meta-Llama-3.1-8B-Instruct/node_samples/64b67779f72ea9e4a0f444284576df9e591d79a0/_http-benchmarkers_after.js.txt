VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. This is because the executable path is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the executable path is determined by the `shell` variable, which is set based on the platform. On Windows, the executable path is set to `'autocannon.cmd'`, while on other platforms, it is set to `'autocannon'`. However, the `child_process.spawnSync` function is called with the executable path as an argument, without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the `shell` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the executable path should be sanitized to prevent command injection attacks. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed executable paths or by using a library that provides a safe way to spawn processes. Additionally, the `child_process.spawnSync` function should be called with the `shell` option set to `false` to prevent shell injection attacks. ```javascript
