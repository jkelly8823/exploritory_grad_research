VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `strrchr` function without bounds checking. This function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of a character in a string, but it does not check if the character is within the bounds of the string. If the input string is large enough, it can cause the function to return a pointer outside the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `strrchr` function is used to find the last occurrence of a character in a string. However, it does not check if the character is within the bounds of the string. If the input string is large enough, it can cause the function to return a pointer outside the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function like `strrchr_s` which is a bounds-checked version of `strrchr`. Alternatively, the code can manually check the bounds of the string before using `strrchr`. Additionally, the code
