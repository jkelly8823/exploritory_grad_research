VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a macro that is not properly sanitized, which can lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro is defined with a variable number of arguments, but it does not properly check the length of the input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is too long, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the use of the V macro to define the reversion enum is not properly sanitized, which can lead to a similar vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro should be modified to properly check the length of the input and prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the V macro should be modified to properly sanitize the input and prevent similar vulnerabilities. This can be achieved by using a safer method of string concatenation, such as using a library like snprintf. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all macros are properly sanitized and that there are no other potential vulnerabilities.  The use of the SECURITY_REVERSIONS macro should be avoided in favor of a safer method of defining
