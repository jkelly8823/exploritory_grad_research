VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The `nghttp2_session* session_` pointer is not checked for null before being used, which could lead to a crash or undefined behavior if the session is freed prematurely.
EXPLANATION: The `nghttp2_session* session_` pointer is not checked for null before being used in the `Http2Session` constructor. This could lead to a crash or undefined behavior if the session is freed prematurely, for example, if the `nghttp2_session` handle is closed or destroyed before the `Http2Session` object is fully constructed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a null check for the `session_` pointer in the `Http2Session` constructor, and throw an exception or return an error if it is null. Additionally, consider using a smart pointer or reference to manage the `nghttp2_session` handle, to ensure it is not freed prematurely. For example: `if (!session_) { throw std::invalid_argument("nghttp2_session handle is null"); }`. This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability and ensure the code is safe
