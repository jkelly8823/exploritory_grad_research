VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential use-after-free vulnerability exists in the Http2Session class. The session_ pointer is not checked for null before being used, which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior if the nghttp2_session handle is freed prematurely.
EXPLANATION: The nghttp2_session handle is not checked for null before being used in the Http2Session class. This could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior if the handle is freed prematurely. The session_ pointer is not validated before being used, which could result in a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a null check for the session_ pointer before using it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the pointer is null before accessing it. For example: if (session_!= nullptr) {... } This will prevent the use-after-free vulnerability and ensure that the program does not crash or behave unexpectedly. Additionally, consider using smart pointers or reference counting to manage the nghttp2_session handle and prevent it from being freed prematurely.  ```c
