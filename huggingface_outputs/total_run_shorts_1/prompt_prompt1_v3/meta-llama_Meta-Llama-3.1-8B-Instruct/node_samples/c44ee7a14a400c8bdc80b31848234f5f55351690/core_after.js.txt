VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leak due to the lack of proper cleanup of event listeners.
EXPLANATION: The code uses event listeners to track the presence of certain events, but it does not properly remove these listeners when they are no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak over time, as the event listeners continue to consume memory even after they are no longer in use.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly remove event listeners when they are no longer needed. This can be done by using the `off` method to remove the listeners, and by checking if the listener is still attached before removing it. For example, in the `sessionListenerRemoved` function, the code should check if the listener is still attached before removing it, like this: `if (this.listenerCount(name) > 0 && this.listener(name)!== null) {... }`. Additionally, the code should also properly clean up event listeners when the session is destroyed, by calling the `off` method on the session object. For example, in the `sessionOnError` function, the code should call `this.off('error
