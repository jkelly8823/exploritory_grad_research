VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. The `parse_uint` function is used to parse an unsigned integer from a string, but the result is cast to a 16-bit signed integer. If the parsed value is greater than 32767, it will be truncated to -32768, causing an incorrect status code to be set.
EXPLANATION: The `parse_uint` function returns an unsigned integer, which can be up to 4294967295. However, the `stream->status_code` variable is a 16-bit signed integer, which can only hold values between -32768 and 32767. If the parsed value is greater than 32767, it will be truncated to -32768, causing an incorrect status code to be set. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a larger integer type, such as `uint32_t`, to store the parsed status code. Alternatively, the code can add a check to ensure that the parsed value is within the valid range for a 16-bit signed integer. For example: `if (stream
