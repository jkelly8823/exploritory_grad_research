VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data is not checked for NULL before being dereferenced. This could lead to a segmentation fault if session is NULL.
EXPLANATION: The function nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data is called with a session pointer that is not checked for NULL. If session is NULL, then the function will attempt to dereference it, leading to a segmentation fault. This is a classic example of a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.
