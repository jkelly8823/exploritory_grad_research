VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the `readlen` variable in the `inbound_frame_buf_read` function.
EXPLANATION: The `inbound_frame_buf_read` function reads data from the `iframe` buffer without checking if the `readlen` variable exceeds the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if an attacker sends a malicious frame with a large `readlen` value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the `readlen` variable to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size. This can be done by checking if `readlen` is greater than the buffer size before reading data from the buffer. If `readlen` is greater than the buffer size, return an error or terminate the session. Additionally, consider using a safer function like `nghttp2_session_consume` to read data from the buffer, which performs bounds checking internally.
