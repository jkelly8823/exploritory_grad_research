VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The code attempts to access the memory location pointed to by `altsvc->origin` after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: The `nghttp2_mem_free` function is called on `altsvc->origin` before the code attempts to access it again. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability, where the code is accessing memory that has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to ensure that `altsvc->origin` is not accessed after it has been freed. This can be achieved by moving the `nghttp2_mem_free` call to after the code has finished accessing `altsvc->origin`. Alternatively, a copy of the original value of `altsvc->origin` can be made before freeing the original memory location.  ```c
  nghttp2_ext_altsvc *altsvc;

  altsvc = frame->payload;
  if (altsvc == NULL) {
    return;
  }
  char *origin_copy = strdup(altsvc->origin);
  nghttp2_mem_free(mem
