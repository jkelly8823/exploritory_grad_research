 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. The function nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data() is used to set the user data for a stream, but it does not check if the stream has already been closed. If the stream is closed after the user data is set, but before it is accessed, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data() function is used to set the user data for a stream. However, it does not check if the stream has already been closed. If the stream is closed after the user data is set, but before it is accessed, it can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the user data is still pointing to the memory location of the stream, which has already been freed. When the user data is accessed, it will attempt to access the memory location of the stream, which has already been freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data() function should be modified to check if the stream has already been closed before setting the
