VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols response being interpreted as an error.
EXPLANATION: The code checks for a status code of -1 or 101, and returns an error if it encounters either of these values. However, HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols is a valid response code, and should not be treated as an error. This could potentially cause issues with the protocol implementation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to handle the HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols response correctly, by removing the check for this status code. Alternatively, the code could be modified to return a different error code for this specific status code, if it is not valid for the protocol implementation.  ```bash
if (stream->status_code == 101) {
  return NGHTTP2_ERR_HTTP_HEADER;
}
``` 
```bash
if (stream->status_code == -1) {
  return NGHTTP2_ERR_HTTP_HEADER;
}
``` 
```bash
if (stream->status_code!= 101) {
  return NGHTTP2_ERR_HTTP_HEADER;
}
