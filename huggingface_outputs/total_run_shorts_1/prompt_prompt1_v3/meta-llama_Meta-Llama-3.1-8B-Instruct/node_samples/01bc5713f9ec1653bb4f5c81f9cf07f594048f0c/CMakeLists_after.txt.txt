VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a CMake build script. It checks for the presence of CUnit and enables the creation of a static library if it is present. The static library is then installed in the destination directory specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR. The main library, nghttp2, is also installed in the same directory. The code does not appear to contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is recommended to review the code for any potential issues related to the use of CUnit and the creation of static libraries. Additionally, ensure that the CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR variable is properly set to avoid any installation issues.  ```
