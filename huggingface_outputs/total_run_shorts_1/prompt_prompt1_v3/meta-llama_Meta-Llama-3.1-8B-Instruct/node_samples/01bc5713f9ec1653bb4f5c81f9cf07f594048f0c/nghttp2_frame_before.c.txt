VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The variable altsvc is freed before it is used.
EXPLANATION: The variable altsvc is freed in the previous iteration of the loop, but it is still being used in the current iteration. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Move the nghttp2_mem_free call to after the altsvc variable is no longer used. This can be done by moving the call to the end of the loop, or by introducing a new variable to hold the freed memory. Alternatively, the altsvc variable can be reassigned to point to the new memory location.  ```c
  nghttp2_ext_altsvc *altsvc;

  altsvc = frame->payload;
  /* We use the same buffer for altsvc->origin and
     altsvc->field_value. */
  nghttp2_mem_free(mem, altsvc->origin);
}

```
