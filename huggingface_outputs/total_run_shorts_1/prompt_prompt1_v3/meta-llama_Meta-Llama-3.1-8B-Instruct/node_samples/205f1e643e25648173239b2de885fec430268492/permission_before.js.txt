VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `resolve` function is used to resolve a relative path to an absolute path, but the `reference` variable is not sanitized or validated properly.
EXPLANATION: The `resolve` function can be used to traverse the file system by providing a relative path that points to a parent directory. For example, if the `reference` variable is set to `../file.txt`, the `resolve` function will resolve it to the parent directory of the current working directory, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive files. To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `reference` variable before passing it to the `resolve` function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add input validation and sanitization for the `reference` variable. This can be done by using a library like `path.posix` to normalize the path and prevent path traversal attacks. For example, the code can use the `path.posix.join` function to join the `scope` and `reference` variables, and then use the `path.posix.normalize` function to normalize
