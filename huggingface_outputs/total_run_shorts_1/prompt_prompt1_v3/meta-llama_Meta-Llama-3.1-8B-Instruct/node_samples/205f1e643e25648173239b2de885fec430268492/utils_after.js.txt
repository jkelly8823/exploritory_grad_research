VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential path traversal vulnerability exists due to the use of the resolve function from the pathModule. This function can be used to resolve paths that may be outside of the intended directory, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive files.
EXPLANATION: The resolve function from the pathModule can be used to resolve paths that may be outside of the intended directory. This can be exploited by an attacker to access sensitive files. In this case, the permission model is enabled, and the path is resolved using the resolve function. However, there is no validation of the path to ensure it is within the intended directory. This makes it possible for an attacker to provide a path that is outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the path to ensure it is within the intended directory. You can use the isAbsolute function from the pathModule to check if the path is absolute, and then use the join function to join the path with the intended directory. This will prevent an attacker from providing a path that is outside of the intended directory. For example: ```javascript
if (permission.isEnabled
