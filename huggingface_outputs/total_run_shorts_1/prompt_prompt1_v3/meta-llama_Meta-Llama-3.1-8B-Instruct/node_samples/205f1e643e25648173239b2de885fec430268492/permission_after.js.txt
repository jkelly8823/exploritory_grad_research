VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `resolve` function is used to resolve the `reference` path, but the `reference` path is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `reference` path to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `resolve` function is used to resolve the `reference` path, but it does not perform any validation on the path. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the `reference` path to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, if the `reference` path is set to `../evil/file`, the `resolve` function would resolve it to the parent directory of the intended directory, allowing the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a path validation function to ensure that the `reference` path is properly sanitized. One possible solution is to use the `path.isAbsolute` function to check if the `reference` path is absolute, and if so, use the `path.resolve` function to resolve it to a relative path. Alternatively, the
