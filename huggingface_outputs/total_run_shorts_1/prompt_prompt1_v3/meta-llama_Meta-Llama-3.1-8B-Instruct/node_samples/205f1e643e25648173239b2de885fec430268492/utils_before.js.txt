VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential path traversal vulnerability exists due to the use of the `pathModule.resolve()` function without proper validation of the input path.
EXPLANATION: The `pathModule.resolve()` function can be used to resolve a relative path to an absolute path, which can lead to a path traversal vulnerability if the input path is not properly validated. In this case, the function `permission.isEnabled()` is used to determine whether to resolve the path, but this does not guarantee that the input path is safe. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the input path to ensure it is safe before passing it to `pathModule.resolve()`. You can use a library like `path` to normalize the path and remove any redundant separators or parent directory references. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific paths to be resolved. For example, you can use a regular expression to match the input path against a set of allowed patterns. ```javascript
if (permission.isEnabled()) {
  const allowedPaths = [/^\/path\/to\/allowed\/directory$/,
