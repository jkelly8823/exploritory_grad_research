 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a permission bypass attack. The `spawnSync` function is used to execute a command with elevated permissions, but the command is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `spawnSync` function is used to execute a command with elevated permissions, but the command is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the command, which can be executed with elevated permissions. In this case, the command is executing a series of `console.log` statements, but an attacker could modify the command to execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the command should be properly sanitized to prevent arbitrary code execution. This can be done by using a library such as `child_process` to execute the command, and by properly validating the input to the command. Additionally, the use of `spawnSync` should be avoided in favor of a more secure alternative, such as `child_process.execSync`. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not executing any sensitive operations with elevated permissions.  The `--allow-fs-write` flag should be removed as it
