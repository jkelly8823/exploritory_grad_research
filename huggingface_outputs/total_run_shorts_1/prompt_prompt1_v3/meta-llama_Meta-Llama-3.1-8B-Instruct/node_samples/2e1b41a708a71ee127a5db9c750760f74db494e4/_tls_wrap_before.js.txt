 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the `sessionId` and `session` parameters in the `onnewsessionclient` and `onnewsession` functions. An attacker could potentially send malicious input to these functions, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The `onnewsessionclient` and `onnewsession` functions do not perform any input validation on the `sessionId` and `session` parameters. This makes it possible for an attacker to send malicious input to these functions, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. The lack of input validation also makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue, as the application may not provide any error messages or stack traces.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform input validation on the `sessionId` and `session` parameters in the `onnewsessionclient` and `onnewsession` functions. This can be done by checking the type and length of the input, as well as verifying that it conforms to the expected format
