 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential memory leak is present due to the use of ObjectCreate(null) without a corresponding ObjectDestroy call.
EXPLANATION: The ObjectCreate function is used to create a new object, but it does not automatically manage the memory of the object. This means that if the object is no longer needed, it will not be automatically destroyed, leading to a potential memory leak. In this case, the object is created on line 8, but there is no corresponding ObjectDestroy call to free the memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add an ObjectDestroy call to free the memory when the object is no longer needed. For example, you could add a try/finally block to ensure that the ObjectDestroy call is executed even if an exception is thrown. ```javascript
try {
  // code that uses the object
} finally {
  ObjectDestroy(c.infoAccess);
}
``` ```javascript
