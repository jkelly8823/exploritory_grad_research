VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function GetValidTo does not check if the cert pointer is null before dereferencing it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The function GetValidTo takes a pointer to an X509 object as an argument, but it does not check if this pointer is null before using it to access the X509 object. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the cert pointer is null, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function GetValidTo should be modified to check if the cert pointer is null before using it to access the X509 object. This can be done by adding a simple null check at the beginning of the function, such as if (cert == nullptr) return env->Undefined();. This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure that the function behaves correctly even if the cert pointer is null.  Additionally, it would be a good practice to check the return value of the function to ensure that it is not null before using it.  This can be done by checking if the return value is not null before returning it.  This will prevent
