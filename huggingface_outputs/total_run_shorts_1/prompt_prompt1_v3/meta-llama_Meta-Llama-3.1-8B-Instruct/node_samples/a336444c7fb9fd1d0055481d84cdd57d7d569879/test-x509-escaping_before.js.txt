VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of an array with a mix of valid and invalid JSON data. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when parsing the JSON data.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains an array called `invalidJSON` that contains a mix of valid and invalid JSON data. The presence of invalid JSON data in the array can cause issues when parsing the JSON data. This is because JSON is a strict data format that requires all data to be properly formatted. If the data is not properly formatted, it can cause the JSON parser to throw an error or produce unexpected results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that all data in the `invalidJSON` array is properly formatted according to the JSON specification. This can be done by validating the data before adding it to the array or by using a library that can handle invalid JSON data. Additionally, consider using a more robust JSON parsing library that can handle errors and unexpected data more effectively.  ```javascript
const invalidJSON = [
  '{"key": "value"}', // valid JSON
  '{"key": "value" invalid JSON', // invalid JSON
