VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of ObjectCreate(null) without checking if the infoAccess object is null or undefined before attempting to reassign it. This could lead to a TypeError if infoAccess is null or undefined.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to reassign the infoAccess property of the certificate object c. However, it does this without checking if the infoAccess object is null or undefined. If infoAccess is null or undefined, attempting to reassign it will result in a TypeError. This is a potential vulnerability because it could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the infoAccess object is null or undefined before attempting to reassign it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the reassignment. For example: if (infoAccess!= null) { c.infoAccess = ObjectCreate(null); } else { // handle the case where infoAccess is null or undefined }. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring and ensure that the code behaves as expected.  ```javascript
function translatePeerCertificate(peerCert) {
  //... implementation...
