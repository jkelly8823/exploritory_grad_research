VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `GetValidTo` does not check if the `cert` pointer is null before dereferencing it, which can lead to a null pointer dereference vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function `GetValidTo` takes a pointer to an `X509` object as an argument, but it does not check if this pointer is null before using it. If the `cert` pointer is null, the function will attempt to dereference it, leading to a null pointer dereference vulnerability. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function `GetValidTo` should be modified to check if the `cert` pointer is null before using it. This can be done by adding a simple null check at the beginning of the function. For example: `if (cert == nullptr) { return env->Undefined(); }`. This will prevent the null pointer dereference vulnerability and ensure that the function behaves correctly even when passed a null pointer.
