VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `writeFileSync` function is being used with a user-controlled input (`i`) in the file path.
EXPLANATION: The `writeFileSync` function is being used with a user-controlled input (`i`) in the file path. This allows an attacker to potentially write files to arbitrary locations on the system by manipulating the value of `i`. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer method of writing files, such as `fs.writeFileSync` with a path that is constructed using a library function that prevents path traversal attacks, such as `path.join`. For example: `fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, `info-${i}-cert.pem`), `${pem}\n`);`. This will ensure that the file is written to a safe location and prevent potential path traversal attacks. Additionally, you should validate the input `i` to ensure it is a valid integer and does not contain any malicious characters.  ```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
