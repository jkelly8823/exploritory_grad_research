 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `punycode` module, which is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of Node.js.
EXPLANATION: The `punycode` module is used to convert Unicode domain names to ASCII. However, it has been deprecated since Node.js v7.0.0 and will be removed in future versions. This could potentially lead to security issues if the code relies on this module.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the `punycode` module with a more modern and secure alternative, such as the `idna-uts46` module. This can be done by installing the new module using npm or yarn and then updating the code to use the new module. For example: `const idna = require('idna-uts46');` and then use the `idna` module instead of `punycode`. Additionally, consider updating the code to use the `dns` module for domain name resolution, which is more secure and reliable. ```javascript
const dns = require('dns');
const idna = require('idna-uts46');
