 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `punycode` module, which is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of Node.js.
EXPLANATION: The `punycode` module is used in the code snippet, but it is deprecated and may be removed in future versions of Node.js. This could potentially lead to security issues if the code is not updated to use a compatible alternative.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Update the code to use a compatible alternative to the `punycode` module, such as the `idna-uts46-harmony` module. This can be done by replacing the `punycode` module with the new module and updating any relevant code to use the new module's functions. 

Note: The `punycode` module is deprecated since Node.js v7.0.0 and will be removed in a future version. The `idna-uts46-harmony` module is a compatible alternative that can be used in its place. 

Please let me know if this is correct. 

Also, I would like to know if there is a way to automate
