The code snippet is written in a documentation style, using JSDoc comments to describe the properties and methods of the `TextEncoderStream` and `TextDecoderStream` classes. There are no code blocks or executable statements, which means there are no potential vulnerabilities to identify.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary, as the code snippet is purely documentation and does not contain any code that could be executed or pose a security risk.  Please note that this code is likely part of a larger project, and the actual implementation of the classes and methods may contain vulnerabilities. However, based on the provided code snippet alone, there are no vulnerabilities to detect.  Please ensure that the actual implementation of the classes and methods is thoroughly reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities.  If you are unsure about the security of your code, consider consulting with a security expert or using a code review tool to identify potential issues.  Additionally, make sure to follow secure coding practices, such as input
