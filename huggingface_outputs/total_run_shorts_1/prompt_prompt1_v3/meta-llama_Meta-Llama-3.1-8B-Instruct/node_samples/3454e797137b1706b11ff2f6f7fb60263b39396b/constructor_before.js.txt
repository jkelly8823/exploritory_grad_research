 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack. This is because the `ObjectDefineProperty` function is used to define a property on the `Object.prototype` object, which can be exploited to pollute the prototype chain.
EXPLANATION: The `ObjectDefineProperty` function is used to define a property on the `Object.prototype` object, which can be exploited to pollute the prototype chain. This is a classic example of a prototype pollution attack. An attacker could potentially add a malicious property to the `Object.prototype` object, which would then be inherited by all objects in the application, leading to unintended behavior and potentially even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `ObjectDefineProperty` function should be used to define a property on a specific object, rather than on the `Object.prototype` object. For example, instead of `ObjectDefineProperty(Object.prototype, 'toString', { value: function() { return 'toString'; } });`, the code should use `ObjectDefineProperty(tabularData, 'toString', { value: function() { return 'toString'; } });`. This will prevent the prototype pollution attack and
