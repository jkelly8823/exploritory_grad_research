VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype pollution via console.table.
EXPLANATION: The test case is attempting to pollute the Object prototype by writing to object[column][index] within console.table. This is a known vulnerability in earlier versions of Node.js.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Avoid using console.table with untrusted input, and ensure that the input is properly sanitized before passing it to console.table. Additionally, consider upgrading to a newer version of Node.js that has fixed this vulnerability.  If you must use console.table with untrusted input, consider using a library that provides a safer alternative, such as `console.log` or `console.dir`.  Also, be aware that this vulnerability is not present in the latest versions of Node.js.  However, if you are using an older version, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version to ensure the security of your application.  It is also recommended to use a linter or a code analysis tool to detect such vulnerabilities in your code.  Finally, consider using a library that provides a safer alternative to console.table, such as `console.log` or `console.dir`.  This will help prevent such vulnerabilities in the future.
