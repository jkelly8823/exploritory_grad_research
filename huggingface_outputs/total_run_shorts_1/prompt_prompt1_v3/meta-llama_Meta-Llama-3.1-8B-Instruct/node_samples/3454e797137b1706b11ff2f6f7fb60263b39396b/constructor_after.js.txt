VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack. This is because the `ObjectCreate` function is used to create an object that will be used to store values, but the object is created with `null` as its prototype. This allows an attacker to manipulate the prototype chain and potentially inject arbitrary values into the object.
EXPLANATION: The `ObjectCreate` function is used to create a new object with a specified prototype. In this case, the prototype is set to `null`, which means that the object will inherit from the global object. This allows an attacker to manipulate the prototype chain and potentially inject arbitrary values into the object. For example, if an attacker were to set `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(map, 'toString') = function() { return 'Hello, World!'; }`, they could then access the `toString` method on the `map` object, even though it was not originally defined on the object.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use `Object.create(null)` instead of `ObjectCreate(null)`. This will create an object with no prototype, preventing an attacker from manipulating the prototype chain. Additionally
