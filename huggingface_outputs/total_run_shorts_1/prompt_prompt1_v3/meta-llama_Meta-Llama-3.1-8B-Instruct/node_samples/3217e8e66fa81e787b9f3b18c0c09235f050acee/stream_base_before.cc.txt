VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the 'nread' variable.
EXPLANATION: The CHECK_LE macro is used to check if 'nread' is less than or equal to 'buf.len', but it does not prevent 'nread' from being greater than 'buf.len'. This means that if 'nread' is larger than 'buf.len', the Buffer::New function will still be called with an out-of-bounds index, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the CHECK_LE macro with a CHECK_LT macro to ensure that 'nread' is strictly less than 'buf.len'. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability. Alternatively, consider using a safer function like Buffer::NewWithLength to avoid this issue altogether.  ```c
  CHECK_LT(static_cast<size_t>(nread), buf.len);
  ``` or ```c
  Local<Object> obj = Buffer::NewWithLength(env, buf.base, nread);
  ``` ```c
  stream->CallJSOnreadMethod(nread, obj);
  ``` ```c
  ``` ```c
  ``` ```
