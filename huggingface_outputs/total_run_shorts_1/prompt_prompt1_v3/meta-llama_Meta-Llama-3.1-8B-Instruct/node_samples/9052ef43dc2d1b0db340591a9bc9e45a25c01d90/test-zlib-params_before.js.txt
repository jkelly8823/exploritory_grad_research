 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a shared resource (the `deflater` object) in a multi-threaded environment.
EXPLANATION: The `deflater` object is being used in a callback function, which is executed asynchronously. Meanwhile, the `process.once('exit',...)` block is executed synchronously. This creates a window of opportunity for another thread to access the `deflater` object and modify its state, leading to a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a thread-safe approach, such as using a lock or a synchronized block to ensure exclusive access to the `deflater` object. Alternatively, consider using a library that provides a thread-safe implementation of the `deflater` object. Additionally, consider using a more robust testing framework that can handle asynchronous code and race conditions.  ```javascript
const chunk1 = file.slice(0, chunkSize);
const chunk2 = file.slice(chunkSize);
