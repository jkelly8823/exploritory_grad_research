VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a recursive function call in the `_read` method. This can lead to a stack overflow if the input data is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The `_read` method is being overridden to call itself recursively, which can cause a stack overflow if the input data is large enough. This is a classic example of a DoS attack, where an attacker can cause the system to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `_read` method should be modified to avoid recursive function calls. One possible solution is to use a loop instead of recursion to process the input data. Additionally, the `write` method should be called only once, without the recursive call to `_read`. The corrected code should look like this:
```javascript
if (!streamBufferIsFull) {
  this.write(handle.flushFlag,
             this.buffer, // in
             handle.inOff, // in_off
             handle.availInBefore, // in_len
             self._outBuffer, // out
