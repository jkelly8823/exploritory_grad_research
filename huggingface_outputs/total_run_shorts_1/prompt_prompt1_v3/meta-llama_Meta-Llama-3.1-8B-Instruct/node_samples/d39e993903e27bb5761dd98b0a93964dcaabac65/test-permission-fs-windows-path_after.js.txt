VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a permission escalation attack. The '--allow-fs-write' flag allows the process to write to the file system, which can be used to escalate privileges.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the '--allow-fs-write' flag to allow the process to write to the file system. This flag can be used to escalate privileges by writing to sensitive files or directories. The code is also using the'spawnSync' function to execute a command with elevated privileges, which can be used to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the '--allow-fs-write' flag and use a safer alternative to execute the command. Use a library like 'child_process' to execute the command with the correct permissions. Additionally, validate the output of the command to ensure it is not being used to escalate privileges.  ```javascript
const { spawnSync } = require('child_process');

const { stdout, status, stderr } = spawnSync(process.execPath, [
  '--experimental-permission', '--allow-fs-write', 'C:\\*', '-e',
  "console.log(process.permission.has('fs.write', '\\\\\\\\A\\\\C
