 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 8, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of substr() and erase() methods on the resolved_param string without checking its length. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow if the input string is very large.
EXPLANATION: The substr() and erase() methods can potentially cause a buffer overflow if the input string is very large. This is because these methods do not check the length of the string before attempting to access and modify it. If the input string is very large, it can cause the string to exceed its buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the resolved_param string before attempting to use the substr() and erase() methods. This can be done by using the size() method to get the length of the string and then checking if it is within a safe range. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer method to remove the leading characters, such as using the find() method to find the position of the first non-leading character and then using substr()
