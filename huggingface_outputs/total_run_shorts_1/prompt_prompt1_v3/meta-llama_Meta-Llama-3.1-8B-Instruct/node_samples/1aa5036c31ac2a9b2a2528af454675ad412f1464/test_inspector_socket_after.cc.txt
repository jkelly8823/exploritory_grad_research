VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP Host header attacks. The code does not properly validate the Host header, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious requests.
EXPLANATION: The code is testing various scenarios for invalid Host headers, but it does not actually validate the Host header. This allows an attacker to inject malicious requests by manipulating the Host header. The code should validate the Host header to prevent such attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should validate the Host header to ensure it conforms to the HTTP/1.1 specification. This can be done by checking that the Host header is present, and that it contains a valid IP address or hostname. The code should also check that the Host header does not contain any invalid characters, such as empty octets or too few or too many octets. Additionally, the code should check that the Host header does not contain any IP addresses that are out of range. This can be done by using a regular expression to validate the Host header. For example: `std::regex pattern("^([a-zA-Z0-9.-]+):\\d+$");` and then `if (!std::regex_match(host_header, pattern))
