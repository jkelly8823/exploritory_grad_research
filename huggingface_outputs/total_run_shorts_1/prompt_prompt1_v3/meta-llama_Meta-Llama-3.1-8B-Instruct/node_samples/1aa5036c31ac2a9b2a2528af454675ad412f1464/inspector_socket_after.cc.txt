VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function IsIPAddress does not correctly handle IPv6 addresses. It incorrectly assumes that an IPv6 address will always be enclosed in square brackets, which is not the case for all IPv6 addresses.
EXPLANATION: The function IsIPAddress checks if a string is an IPv4 address by checking if it is enclosed in square brackets. However, this is not a correct way to check for IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses can be enclosed in square brackets, but they can also be written without them. The function also incorrectly assumes that an IPv6 address will always have four octets, which is not the case for all IPv6 addresses.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function IsIPAddress should be modified to correctly handle IPv6 addresses. This can be done by checking if the string contains a colon (:), which is the separator used in IPv6 addresses. The function should also be modified to correctly handle IPv6 addresses with more than four octets. One way to do this is to use a regular expression to match the IPv6 address format. Alternatively, the function can be modified to use a more robust method to parse the IPv6 address
