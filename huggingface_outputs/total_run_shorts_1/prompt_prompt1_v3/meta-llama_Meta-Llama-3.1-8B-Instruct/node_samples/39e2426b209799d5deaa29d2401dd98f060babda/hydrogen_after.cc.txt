VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. This occurs when the product of constant->Integer32Value() and sign is greater than or equal to 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by an int32_t. This can lead to incorrect results or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a larger integer type, such as int64_t, to store the product of constant->Integer32Value() and sign. Alternatively, you can add a check to ensure that the product does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an int32_t. For example: if (value > INT32_MAX) return;. This will prevent the overflow and ensure that the code behaves correctly.  ```c
  int64_t value = constant->Integer32Value() * sign;
  //... rest of the code...
``` or ```c
  if (value > INT32_MAX) return;
  int32_t value = constant->Integer32Value() * sign;
  //... rest of the code...
```  ```c
```
