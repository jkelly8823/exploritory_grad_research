VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The class ArrayInstructionInterface has a pure virtual function GetKey() that does not have a proper implementation in the derived class. This can lead to undefined behavior when the function is called.
EXPLANATION: The class ArrayInstructionInterface has a pure virtual function GetKey() that is declared but not implemented. This is a problem because the derived class is expected to provide an implementation for this function. However, in this case, the derived class does not provide an implementation, which can lead to undefined behavior when the function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The derived class should provide an implementation for the GetKey() function. This can be done by adding a new function to the derived class that returns the key value. The function should be declared as virtual to ensure that the correct implementation is called. Additionally, the function should be implemented to return the correct key value. For example: virtual HValue* GetKey() { return key_; } where key_ is a member variable that stores the key value.
