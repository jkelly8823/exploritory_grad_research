VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the'manifest' variable is not guaranteed to be initialized before it is accessed in the getter function.
EXPLANATION: The'manifest' variable is initialized in the constructor, but it is not guaranteed to be initialized before the getter function is called. This is because the constructor is asynchronous and the getter function is called synchronously. If the constructor has not finished executing when the getter function is called, the'manifest' variable will be undefined, leading to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the'manifest' variable should be initialized with a default value or a promise that resolves to the initialized value. Alternatively, the getter function should be modified to check if the'manifest' variable is initialized before accessing it. This can be done by adding a null check or by using the optional chaining operator. For example: `return manifest?.getSomething();` would return undefined if'manifest' is null or undefined, instead of throwing an error.  Additionally, the constructor should be modified to ensure that it is synchronous or that the getter function is called
