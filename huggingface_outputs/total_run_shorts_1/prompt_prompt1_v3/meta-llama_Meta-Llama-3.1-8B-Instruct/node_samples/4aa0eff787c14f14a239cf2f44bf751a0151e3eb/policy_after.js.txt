VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of deprecated APIs (process.binding and process._linkedBinding) which can be bypassed by policies.
EXPLANATION: The process.binding() and process._linkedBinding() functions are deprecated and can be bypassed by policies, allowing an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) attack. This is a security risk because it can be exploited by an attacker to crash the process or cause other unintended behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the deprecated APIs with alternative methods that are not vulnerable to bypassing by policies. For example, use the process.binding() function with caution and only when necessary, and consider using alternative methods such as using the 'internal/policy/manifest' module directly. Additionally, ensure that policies are properly configured to prevent bypassing of the deprecated APIs.  Also, the code should be refactored to handle the case where manifest is undefined before trying to access it.  The get manifest function should be refactored to handle the case where manifest is undefined before trying to access it.  The code should be refact
