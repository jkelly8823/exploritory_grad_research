 


VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is using `process.binding()` which is for use by Node.js internal code only and is unavailable when policies are enabled.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using `process.binding()` which is a private API that is not intended for use in external code. This can lead to issues when policies are enabled, as it is unavailable in such cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace `process.binding()` with the recommended alternative, which is to use the `dgram` module directly. For example, instead of `const binding = process.binding('dgram');`, use `const dgram = require('dgram');`. This will ensure that the code is policy-compliant and avoids using private APIs. Additionally, consider using the `dgram` module's public API to achieve the desired functionality. ```javascript
const dgram = require('dgram');
const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
