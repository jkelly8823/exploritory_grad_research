VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP parsing errors due to receiving too much data for chunk extensions or unexpected content length.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP parsing errors because it does not handle cases where more than 16 KiB of data is received for chunk extensions or when the content length is unexpected. This can lead to an `Error` being emitted.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle these edge cases properly. This can be achieved by implementing a mechanism to limit the amount of data received for chunk extensions or by validating the content length before processing the request or response. Additionally, error handling mechanisms should be implemented to catch and handle any errors that may occur during the HTTP parsing process.  The code should also be tested thoroughly to ensure that it can handle these edge cases correctly.  It is also recommended to use a library or framework that provides robust HTTP parsing and error handling capabilities.  This will help to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  It is also recommended to implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to any errors that may occur during the HTTP parsing process.  This will help to identify
