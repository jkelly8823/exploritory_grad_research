VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the presence of a malicious HTTP request in the `msg` array. The malicious request is crafted to exploit the difference in how the server and client handle HTTP requests.
EXPLANATION: The code creates an HTTP server and a client, and sends a malicious HTTP request to the server through the client. The malicious request is designed to exploit the difference in how the server and client handle HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to smuggle malicious requests past the server's defenses. This is a classic example of HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS).
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle HTTP requests and responses, and to prevent the smuggling of malicious requests. This can be achieved by using a library or framework that provides robust HTTP request handling, such as Express.js or Hapi. Additionally, the code should be reviewed and tested to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other types of attacks. The `msg` array should be sanitized to prevent the injection of malicious requests. The server should be configured to properly handle HTTP requests and responses, and to prevent
