VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling attacks. This is because the serverHandler function does not properly handle chunked encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTTP requests.
EXPLANATION: The serverHandler function is designed to handle HTTP requests, but it does not properly handle chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTTP requests by manipulating the chunked encoding of the request. Specifically, the function does not check for the presence of a chunked encoding header, and it does not properly handle the case where the chunked encoding header is missing. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious request by manipulating the chunked encoding of the original request.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the serverHandler function should be modified to properly handle chunked encoding. This can be done by checking for the presence of a chunked encoding header and properly handling the case where the header is missing. Additionally, the function should be modified to properly handle the case where the chunked encoding header is present but the chunked encoding is invalid. This can be done by checking for the presence of a chunked encoding header and verifying that the chunked encoding is
