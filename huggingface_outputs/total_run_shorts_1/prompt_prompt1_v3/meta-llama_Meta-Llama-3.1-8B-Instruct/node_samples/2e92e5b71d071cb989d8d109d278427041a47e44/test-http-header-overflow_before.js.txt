VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the use of a legacy HTTP parser. This parser is known to be vulnerable to HRS attacks.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `--http-parser` option to switch between the default and legacy HTTP parsers. The legacy parser is known to be vulnerable to HRS attacks, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious headers into a request. This can lead to unintended behavior, such as accessing sensitive data or executing malicious code. The code is also using a custom header name and value to create a large header that exceeds the maximum allowed size, which can trigger the HRS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be updated to use the default HTTP parser instead of the legacy parser. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle large headers correctly, such as by using a more robust header parsing library. It's also recommended to remove the custom header name and value, as they are not necessary for the functionality of the code. Finally, the code should be reviewed and tested to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other types of attacks.
