 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling. This occurs when a client sends a request with a Transfer-Encoding: chunked header, but also includes a Content-Length header with a value that is less than the actual length of the request body. This can cause the server to process the request incorrectly, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling because it does not properly handle the Transfer-Encoding: chunked header. The server is expecting a single chunked request, but the client is sending a request with multiple chunked requests. This can cause the server to process the requests incorrectly, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the server should be modified to properly handle multiple chunked requests. This can be done by checking the Transfer-Encoding header and handling it accordingly. Additionally, the server should be modified to check the Content-Length header and handle it accordingly. This can be done by checking if the Content-Length header is present and if its value is greater than the actual length of the request body. If the Content-Length header is present and its value is greater than the actual length
