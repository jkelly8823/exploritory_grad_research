VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the use of a large header value that exceeds the maximum allowed size, causing the server to parse the request incorrectly.
EXPLANATION: The code creates a large header value by repeating the character 'a' to a size that is 1 byte larger than the maximum allowed size. This causes the server to parse the request incorrectly, leading to a potential security vulnerability. The `expectsError` function is used to test for this specific error condition, indicating that the code is intentionally attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that header values do not exceed the maximum allowed size. This can be achieved by using a more robust method for generating header values, such as using a library that handles header parsing and validation. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not intentionally attempting to exploit this vulnerability. The `expectsError` function should be removed or modified to test for a different error condition.  The server should be configured to handle large header values correctly, such as by increasing the maximum allowed size or using
