 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a set of preprocessor directives that define version numbers and a flag for strict mode. The version numbers are defined using the #define directive, and the strict mode flag is defined using the #ifndef directive. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a standard and safe use of preprocessor directives.  The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security risks.  However, it is worth noting that the use of #ifndef directives can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.  In this case, the directive is used to define a flag that can be overridden by the user, which is a safe and common practice.  Nevertheless, it is always a good idea to carefully consider the implications of using preprocessor directives in code.  In general, this code snippet is safe and does not require any changes.  It is a good example of how to use preprocessor directives to define constants and flags in a safe and controlled manner
