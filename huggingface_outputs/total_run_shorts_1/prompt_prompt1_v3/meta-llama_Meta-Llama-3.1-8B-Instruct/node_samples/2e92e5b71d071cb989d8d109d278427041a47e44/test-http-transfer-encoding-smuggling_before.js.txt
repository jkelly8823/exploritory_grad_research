 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to the presence of a Transfer-Encoding: chunked-false header in the request message.
EXPLANATION: The Transfer-Encoding: chunked-false header is not a valid HTTP header and can be used to smuggle HTTP requests. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the Transfer-Encoding: chunked-false header from the request message to prevent HTTP request smuggling. Additionally, consider implementing measures to validate and sanitize incoming HTTP requests to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  The Transfer-Encoding: chunked header should only be used once in a request.  The server should also be configured to reject requests with multiple Transfer-Encoding headers.  This can be done by checking the request headers for duplicate Transfer-Encoding headers and responding with a 400 Bad Request status code if a duplicate is found.  This will prevent the server from being vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling.  The server should also be configured to reject requests with a Transfer-Encoding: chunked-false header.  This can be done by checking the request headers for a Transfer-Encoding: chunked-false header and responding with a 400
