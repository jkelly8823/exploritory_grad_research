VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a security risk due to the use of io_uring, which is disabled by default due to security concerns. This is because applications must not change the user identity of the process at runtime when io_uring is enabled.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not contain any explicit code, but it warns about the security concerns related to io_uring. This indicates that the code is vulnerable to a security risk if io_uring is enabled.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should avoid using io_uring or ensure that it does not change the user identity of the process at runtime. This can be achieved by removing the io_uring dependency or by using alternative methods that do not involve changing the user identity. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not invoke system functions that are not allowed when io_uring is enabled.  ```bash
if [ "$1" = "true" ]; then
  echo "io_uring is enabled"
fi
