VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when calling the Write function.
EXPLANATION: The Write function is called with a maximum number of characters to write (max_chars), but it does not check if the actual number of characters written (nchars) exceeds the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the Write function writes more characters than the buffer can hold.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the actual number of characters written (nchars) does not exceed the buffer size. This can be done by checking if nchars is greater than max_chars before returning from the function. Additionally, consider using a safer function that performs bounds checking internally, such as std::string::write.  ```c
size_t* chars_written) {
  uint16_t* const dst = reinterpret_cast<uint16_t*>(buf);

  size_t max_chars = (buflen / sizeof(*dst));
  size_t nchars;
  size_t alignment = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(dst) % sizeof(*dst);
  if (alignment == 0) {
    nchars = str->Write(dst,
