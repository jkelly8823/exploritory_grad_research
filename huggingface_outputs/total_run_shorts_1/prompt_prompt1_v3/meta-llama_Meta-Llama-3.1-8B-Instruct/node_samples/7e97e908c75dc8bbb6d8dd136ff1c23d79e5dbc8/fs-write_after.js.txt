VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition when deleting a file. This is because the fs.unlink function is called before the file is actually blocked, allowing a malicious actor to delete the file before it is blocked.
EXPLANATION: The fs.unlink function is called before the file is blocked, which means that a malicious actor could potentially delete the file before it is blocked, resulting in a race condition. This is a security vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass the blocking mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the fs.unlink function should be called after the file is blocked. This can be achieved by moving the fs.unlink call to after the file is blocked, or by using a locking mechanism to ensure that the file is not deleted until it is blocked. For example: fs.unlink(blockedFile, (err) => { assert.ifError(err); }); should be moved to after the file is blocked. Alternatively, a locking mechanism such as fs.lockFile could be used to ensure that the file is not deleted until it is blocked.  ```javascript
fs.lockFile(blockedFile, (err) => {
  if (err) {
