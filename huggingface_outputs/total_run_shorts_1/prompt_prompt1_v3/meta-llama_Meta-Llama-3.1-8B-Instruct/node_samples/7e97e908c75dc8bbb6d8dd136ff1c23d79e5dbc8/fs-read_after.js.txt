VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of fs.exists and fs.statfs functions without proper error handling. This can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior when the file system access is denied.
EXPLANATION: The fs.exists and fs.statfs functions are used to check if a file exists and get its file system statistics, respectively. However, if the file system access is denied, these functions will throw an error. The code does not properly handle these errors, which can lead to a crash or unexpected behavior. This is a security vulnerability because an attacker can exploit this by creating a file with a name that is not accessible to the user, causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly handle the errors thrown by fs.exists and fs.statfs functions. This can be done by using try-catch blocks to catch and handle the errors. For example, the code can use the fs.access function to check if the file exists and is accessible before trying to access it. Additionally, the code can use the fs.stat function to get
