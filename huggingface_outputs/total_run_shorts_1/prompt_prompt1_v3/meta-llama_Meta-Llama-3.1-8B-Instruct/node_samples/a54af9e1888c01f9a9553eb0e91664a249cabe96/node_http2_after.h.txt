 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a class or struct definition, and it seems to be related to handling incoming and outgoing data streams. The variables `rejected_stream_count_` and `invalid_frame_count_` are used to track the number of rejected streams and invalid frames, respectively. The functions `CopyDataIntoOutgoing` and `ClearOutgoing` are declared but not defined in this snippet. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure as is. However, it would be a good practice to consider adding input validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure the robustness of the data handling process.  ```
