 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a proper check for the `lib_error_code` value. The `nghttp2_is_fatal` function is used to check if the error is fatal, but it does not cover all possible error codes. This allows an attacker to send a malicious frame with a non-fatal error code that is not handled by the `nghttp2_is_fatal` function, potentially leading to a DoS attack.
EXPLANATION: The `nghttp2_is_fatal` function only checks for a specific set of fatal error codes, but there are other error codes that can be used to trigger a DoS attack. The `lib_error_code` value is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to send a malicious frame with a non-fatal error code that is not handled by the `nghttp2_is_fatal` function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the `lib_error_code` value. This can be done by checking the value against a list of known error codes that can be used to trigger a DoS attack
