 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet appears to be a documentation comment for a function, and does not contain any executable code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is a YAML comment that describes the stability of a function, and does not contain any code that could be executed or pose a security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None. The code snippet is a documentation comment and does not require any changes to address a vulnerability.  The comment is properly formatted and does not contain any syntax errors.  The stability level of the function is clearly documented, which is a good practice.  However, the "added" field in the YAML comment is marked as "REPLACEME", which suggests that it may need to be updated with the actual date when the function was added.  This is a minor issue and does not affect the security of the code.  Overall, the code snippet is secure and does not require any changes to address a vulnerability.  It is a good practice to keep the documentation up to date, but this is not a security-related issue.  The code snippet is properly formatted and does not contain any syntax errors.  The
