 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `stream.isErrored(stream)` is marked as experimental and has a stability of 1, which indicates that it is still in the experimental phase and may change or be removed in the future.
EXPLANATION: The stability of a function is a measure of how stable it is and how likely it is to change in the future. A stability of 1 indicates that the function is still in the experimental phase and may change or be removed in the future. This can make it difficult to rely on the function and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Avoid using the function `stream.isErrored(stream)` until it has been stabilized and its stability has been increased. If you must use it, be aware of the potential risks and have a plan in place to handle any changes or removals. Consider using alternative functions or approaches that have a higher stability rating.  Consider using the `stream.error` event instead, which is a more stable way to detect errors in a stream.  Consider using the `stream.destroyed` property instead, which is a more stable way to detect if a stream has been destroyed.  Consider using
