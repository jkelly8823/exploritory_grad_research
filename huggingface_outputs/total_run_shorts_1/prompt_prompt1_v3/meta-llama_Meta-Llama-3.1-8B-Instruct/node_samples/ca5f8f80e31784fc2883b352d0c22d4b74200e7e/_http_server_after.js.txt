VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation for the `statusCode` variable. An attacker could potentially send a large or negative value for `statusCode`, causing the application to throw an error and potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the `statusCode` is within the valid range (100-999), but it does not validate the input. An attacker could send a large or negative value for `statusCode`, causing the application to throw an error. This could lead to a denial-of-service attack, as the application would be unable to process requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input for `statusCode` to ensure it is within the valid range. This can be done by using a simple check, such as `if (statusCode < 100 || statusCode > 999) { throw new RangeError('Invalid status code'); }`. Additionally, the code should consider using a more robust validation mechanism, such as a regular expression, to ensure that the input is in the correct format. The code should also
