VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly validate the status code, allowing for potential out-of-range values to be used.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the status code is less than 100 or greater than 999, but this check is not sufficient to prevent all out-of-range values. For example, a status code of 1000 would still be allowed. A more robust check would be to ensure that the status code is between 100 and 599, inclusive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Update the code to check if the status code is between 100 and 599, inclusive, like so: `if (statusCode < 100 || statusCode > 599)`. This will prevent out-of-range status codes from being used. Additionally, consider using a more robust validation library to ensure that the status code is a valid HTTP status code.  ```javascript
  if (statusCode < 100 || statusCode > 599) {
    throw new RangeError(`Invalid status code: ${statusCode}`);
  }
```  ```javascript
