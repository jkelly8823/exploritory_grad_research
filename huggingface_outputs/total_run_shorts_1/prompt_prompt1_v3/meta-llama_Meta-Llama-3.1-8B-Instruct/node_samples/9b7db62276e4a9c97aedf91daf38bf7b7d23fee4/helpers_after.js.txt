VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack. The `require` function is being overwritten with a new function that calls the original `mod.require` function. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `require` function to pollute the prototype chain.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `require` function is being overwritten with a new function that calls the original `mod.require` function. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `require` function to pollute the prototype chain. For example, if an attacker can manipulate the `require` function to return a value that is not a module, it can lead to unexpected behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `require` function should not be overwritten with a new function. Instead, the original `require` function should be used directly. If the original `require` function is not available, a new function should be created that does not call the original `require` function. Additionally, input validation should be performed on the `path` parameter to prevent pollution of the prototype chain. For example, the `path` parameter could be validated to
