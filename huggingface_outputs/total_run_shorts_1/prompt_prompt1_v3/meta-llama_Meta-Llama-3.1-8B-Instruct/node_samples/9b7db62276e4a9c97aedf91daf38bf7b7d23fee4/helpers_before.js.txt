VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of the `require` function with user-controlled input.
EXPLANATION: The `require` function is called with a user-controlled `path` parameter, which is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to potentially traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `require` function should be modified to properly sanitize the `path` parameter, such as by using a whitelist of allowed paths or by using a library that provides path sanitization. Additionally, the `require` function should be called with a fixed path, rather than a user-controlled one. For example: `return mod[require_private_symbol](mod, '/path/to/allowed/module');`. This will prevent an attacker from accessing sensitive files through the `require` function.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all user-controlled input is properly sanitized to prevent other potential vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to use a more secure way to resolve the request, such as using a module resolver that is designed to handle path traversal attacks.  Finally, it is recommended to
