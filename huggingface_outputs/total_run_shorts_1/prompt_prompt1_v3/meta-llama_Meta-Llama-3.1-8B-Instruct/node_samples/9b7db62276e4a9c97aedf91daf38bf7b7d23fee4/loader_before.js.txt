VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the `filename` parameter in the `_compile` method. An attacker could provide a malicious `filename` that leads to a recursive directory traversal, causing the program to consume excessive resources and potentially crash.
EXPLANATION: The `path.dirname` function is used to extract the directory name from the `filename` parameter. However, if the `filename` is a specially crafted string, it could lead to a recursive directory traversal, causing the program to consume excessive resources and potentially crash. This is a classic example of a DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the `filename` parameter to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters. This can be achieved by using a library like `path` to normalize the `filename` and prevent directory traversal attacks. Additionally, the code should consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific file paths to be loaded. This will help prevent any potential DoS attacks.
