 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a macro definition for a security reversion list. It defines a series of macros for various security vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-9514, CVE-2019-9516, and CVE-2019-9518. However, the macro definition does not appear to be vulnerable in and of itself.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a macro definition, and as such, it is not directly executable code. The macros defined here are likely used elsewhere in the codebase to handle security reversion logic. The presence of these macros does not inherently introduce any vulnerabilities into the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be a safe and secure macro definition. However, it is essential to ensure that the macros are used correctly and securely throughout the codebase to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  Please ensure that the macros are properly used and that the codebase is regularly reviewed for any potential security issues.  Additionally, it is recommended to keep the macro definitions up-to-date with the latest security vulnerabilities.  This will help ensure that the codebase remains secure and up-to-date.
