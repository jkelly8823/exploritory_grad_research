VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of error handling for the `binding.lstat` function. If an error occurs, it will be swallowed and not propagated to the caller, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
EXPLANATION: The `binding.lstat` function is called with an `undefined` error callback, which means that any errors that occur during the operation will not be handled. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly by manipulating the file system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the error callback should be provided to the `binding.lstat` function. This can be done by passing a valid error callback function, such as the `callback` function that is used elsewhere in the code. For example: `binding.lstat(path, options.bigint, (err, stats) => { callback(err, stats); });`. This will ensure that any errors that occur during the operation are properly handled and propagated to the caller. Additionally, the `callback` function should be checked to ensure that it is a valid
