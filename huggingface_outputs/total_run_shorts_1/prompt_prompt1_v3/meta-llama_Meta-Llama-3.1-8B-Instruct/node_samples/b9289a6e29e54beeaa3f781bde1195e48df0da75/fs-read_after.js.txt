VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of `fs.cpSync` and `fs.lstatSync` methods without proper error handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of files in the `blockedFolder` directory, causing the `fs.cpSync` method to block indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
EXPLANATION: The `fs.cpSync` and `fs.lstatSync` methods are synchronous, meaning they block the execution of the code until they complete. If an attacker creates a large number of files in the `blockedFolder` directory, the `fs.cpSync` method will block indefinitely, causing the code to hang. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use asynchronous methods instead of synchronous ones. For example, `fs.cp` and `fs.lstat` can be used instead of `fs.cpSync` and `fs.lstatSync`. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to prevent the code from hanging in case of an error. The code should
