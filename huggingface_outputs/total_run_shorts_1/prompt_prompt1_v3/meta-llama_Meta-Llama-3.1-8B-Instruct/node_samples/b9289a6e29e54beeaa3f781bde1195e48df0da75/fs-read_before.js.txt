 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of `fs.cpSync` and `fs.statSync` on a blocked folder. An attacker could create a large number of files in the blocked folder, causing the `fs.cpSync` and `fs.statSync` operations to hang indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The `fs.cpSync` and `fs.statSync` functions are synchronous, meaning they block the execution of the code until they complete. If an attacker creates a large number of files in the blocked folder, the `fs.cpSync` and `fs.statSync` operations will take a long time to complete, causing the code to hang indefinitely. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use asynchronous versions of the `fs` functions, such as `fs.cp` and `fs.stat`, and handle errors properly. You can also use a library like `async` to handle asynchronous operations in a more elegant way. Additionally, you should consider implementing rate limiting or other security measures to
