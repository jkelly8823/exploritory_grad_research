 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet appears to be a series of error messages defined using a macro or function E(). These error messages are well-formed and do not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be a series of error messages defined using a macro or function E(). These error messages are well-formed and do not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The error messages are properly formatted and do not contain any potential buffer overflows or other common vulnerabilities. The use of the Error and TypeError constructors suggests that the code is designed to handle errors in a controlled manner.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None. The code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix potential vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test the code to ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios.  The code could be improved by adding more error checking and handling to ensure that it can handle unexpected input or edge cases.  However, this is not a vulnerability in the code as written.  It is a suggestion for improvement.  The code could also be improved by adding more descriptive error messages to help with debugging and troubleshooting.  Again, this is
