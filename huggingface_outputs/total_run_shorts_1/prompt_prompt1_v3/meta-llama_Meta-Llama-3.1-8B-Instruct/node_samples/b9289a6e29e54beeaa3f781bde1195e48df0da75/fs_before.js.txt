VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of error handling for the `binding.lstat` function. If the `binding.lstat` function fails, it will not propagate the error to the caller, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `binding.lstat` function is called with an `undefined` error handler, which means that if the function fails, the error will not be caught or propagated to the caller. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker can cause the `binding.lstat` function to fail repeatedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle errors properly. This can be done by adding a try-catch block around the `binding.lstat` function call, or by providing a proper error handler to the `binding.lstat` function. For example: `try { binding.lstat(...); } catch (err) { console.error(err); }`. Alternatively, the `binding.lstat` function can be modified to propagate errors to the caller. ```javascript
