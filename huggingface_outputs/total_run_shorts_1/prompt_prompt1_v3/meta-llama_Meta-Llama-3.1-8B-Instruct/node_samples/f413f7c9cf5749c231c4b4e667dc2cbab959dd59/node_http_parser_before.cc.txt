VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a static initialization order fiasco.
EXPLANATION: The static initialization order fiasco occurs when the initialization order of static variables is not guaranteed. In this case, the static variable `settings` is initialized in the class definition, but its initialization depends on the value of `kMaxHeaderSize`, which is only defined if `NODE_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP` is defined. This can lead to undefined behavior if `kMaxHeaderSize` is used before it is initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the static variable `settings` should be initialized in a function, rather than in the class definition. This ensures that the initialization order is well-defined. For example, the initialization can be moved to a function like `Parser::Init()`. Additionally, the `kMaxHeaderSize` variable should be initialized before it is used. This can be done by moving its definition to a place where it is guaranteed to be initialized before `settings`. For example, it can be defined in a header file that is included before the class definition.  The `settings` variable should be initialized in a function, rather
