VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a static initialization order fiasco. This is because the static variable `settings` is initialized after it is used in the constructor of the `Parser` class.
EXPLANATION: The static initialization order fiasco occurs when the initialization order of static variables is not guaranteed. In this case, the `Parser` class uses the `settings` variable in its constructor, but the `settings` variable is not initialized until after the constructor is called. This can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the `settings` variable should be initialized before it is used in the constructor of the `Parser` class. This can be achieved by moving the initialization of `settings` to before the constructor definition. Alternatively, the `settings` variable can be made a member variable of the `Parser` class, which would ensure that it is initialized before the constructor is called.  Additionally, the use of static variables should be avoided whenever possible, and instead, consider using a singleton pattern or a factory method to manage the creation of instances.  It is also worth noting that the use of static variables can make the
