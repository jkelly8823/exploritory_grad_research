 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `resolvePath` function is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `resolvePath` function is called with a potentially user-controlled input (`path`). However, the function does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input, making it vulnerable to a path traversal attack. An attacker could manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `resolvePath` function should be modified to properly sanitize the input path. This can be achieved by using a library like `path` to normalize the path and prevent path traversal attacks. For example, the `path.resolve` function can be used to resolve the path to an absolute path, and then the `path.normalize` function can be used to normalize the path and prevent path traversal attacks. Additionally, the `path.join` function can be used to join the path components in a safe manner. ```javascript
const path = require('path');
