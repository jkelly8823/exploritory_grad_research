VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `Buffer.from()` function is used to convert the path to a Buffer, which can be manipulated by an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `Buffer.from()` function can be used to create a Buffer object from a string. However, if the string is a specially crafted path, it can be used to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack. The code is trying to prevent this by using a C++ binding to encode the result of `path.resolve()`, but it is not doing so for the initial conversion of the path to a Buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the C++ binding to encode the path to a Buffer, rather than using `Buffer.from()`. This can be done by replacing the line `path = BufferFrom(path);` with `path = BufferFrom(BufferToString(path));`. This will ensure that the path is properly encoded and prevent path traversal attacks. Additionally, the code should also validate the input path to ensure that it is
