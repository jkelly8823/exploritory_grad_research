VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the insert function on the pending_cleartext_input_ vector, which can lead to a potential buffer overflow if the count is greater than the size of the vector.
EXPLANATION: The pending_cleartext_input_ vector is being resized dynamically by inserting elements from the bufs array. However, the size of the vector is not checked before inserting elements, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the count is greater than the size of the vector. This can potentially allow an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack, leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the vector should be checked before inserting elements. This can be done by using the reserve function to preallocate memory for the vector, or by using the push_back function to insert elements one by one, checking the size of the vector after each insertion. Additionally, the use of the insert function should be avoided in favor of safer alternatives, such as using a std::vector::emplace_back function.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that the count variable is not being manipulated
