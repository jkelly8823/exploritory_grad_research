VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the `insert` method on the `pending_cleartext_input_` container, which does not perform bounds checking on the `bufs` array.
EXPLANATION: The `insert` method on the `pending_cleartext_input_` container does not perform bounds checking on the `bufs` array, which means that if `i` is greater than `count`, the `insert` method will attempt to write beyond the end of the `bufs` array, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform bounds checking on the `bufs` array before calling the `insert` method. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `count` before inserting the data into the container. For example: `if (i <= count) { pending_cleartext_input_.insert(pending_cleartext_input_.end(), &bufs[i], &bufs[count]);
