VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use-after-free vulnerability due to the use of `PersistentToLocal::Strong` on a potentially freed object.
EXPLANATION: The `PersistentToLocal::Strong` call on `session->stream_buf_ab_` is used to ensure that the object is not garbage collected. However, if `session->stream_buf_ab_` has already been freed, this will result in a use-after-free vulnerability. This is because the `PersistentToLocal::Strong` call will attempt to access memory that has already been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that `session->stream_buf_ab_` is not freed before using `PersistentToLocal::Strong` on it. This can be achieved by checking if `session->stream_buf_ab_` is still valid before using it. If it is not valid, create a new object and assign it to `session->stream_buf_ab_`. Additionally, consider using a smart pointer or a reference to manage the lifetime of `session->stream_buf_ab_` to avoid this issue in the future.
