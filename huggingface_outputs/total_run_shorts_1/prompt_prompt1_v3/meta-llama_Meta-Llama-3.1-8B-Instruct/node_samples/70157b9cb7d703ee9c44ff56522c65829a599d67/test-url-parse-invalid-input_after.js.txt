VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `BAD_CHARS` string. This regular expression can cause the `includes()` method to be slow for certain inputs, potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack.
EXPLANATION: The `BAD_CHARS` string contains a regular expression that uses the `#` character as a delimiter. However, the `includes()` method is called on the result of `cp.normalize('NFKD')`, which can cause the regular expression to be slow for certain inputs. This is because the `normalize()` method can produce a string that contains a large number of Unicode code points, and the regular expression engine has to iterate over each code point to determine whether it matches the pattern. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker can provide a large input that causes the regular expression engine to take a long time to execute.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can replace the regular expression in the `BAD_CHARS` string with a simple string comparison. For example, you can use the `includes()` method with a simple string instead
