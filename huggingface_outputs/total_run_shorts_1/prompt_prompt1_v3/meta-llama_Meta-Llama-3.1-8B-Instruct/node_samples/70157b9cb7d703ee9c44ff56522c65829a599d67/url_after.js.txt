 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 44, 45
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a hostname spoofing attack due to the use of the toASCII function in a lenient mode. This allows for the conversion of non-ASCII characters to ASCII, potentially leading to a spoofing attack.
EXPLANATION: The toASCII function is used to convert the hostname to a punycode representation. However, it is used in a lenient mode, which allows for the conversion of non-ASCII characters to ASCII. This can lead to a hostname spoofing attack, where an attacker can manipulate the hostname to appear as a different domain. The forbiddenHostChars test is used to prevent this attack, but it is not sufficient to prevent all possible attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the toASCII function should be used in a strict mode instead of a lenient mode. This will prevent the conversion of non-ASCII characters to ASCII, making it more difficult for an attacker to perform a hostname spoofing attack. Additionally, the forbiddenHostChars test should be removed, as it is not sufficient to prevent all possible attacks. Instead, a more robust solution should be implemented to prevent hostname spoofing
