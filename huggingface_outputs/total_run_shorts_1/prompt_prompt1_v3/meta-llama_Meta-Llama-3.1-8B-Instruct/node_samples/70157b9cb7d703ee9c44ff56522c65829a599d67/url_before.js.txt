VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) vulnerability. This occurs when the toASCII function is used with the lenient mode set to true, which can lead to security issues if the input is not properly validated.
EXPLANATION: The toASCII function is used to convert non-ASCII characters in the hostname to their ASCII equivalents. However, when the lenient mode is set to true, it can lead to security issues if the input is not properly validated. This is because the lenient mode can cause the function to return a punycoded representation of the domain, which can be used to bypass security checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lenient mode should be set to false, and the input should be properly validated before passing it to the toASCII function. Additionally, the toASCII function should be used with caution and only when necessary, as it can introduce security issues if not used correctly. It is also recommended to use a more secure alternative, such as the punycode library, which provides a more secure way to handle IDNA conversions.  ```javascript
