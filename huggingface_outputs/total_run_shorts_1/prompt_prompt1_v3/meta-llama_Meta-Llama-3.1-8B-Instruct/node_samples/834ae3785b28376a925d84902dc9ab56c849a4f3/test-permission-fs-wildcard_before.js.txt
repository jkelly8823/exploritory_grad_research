VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a permission escalation attack. The `--allow-fs-read` flag is used to grant read access to specific directories, but the code is attempting to check if a process has permission to read a file in a directory that is not explicitly granted access.
EXPLANATION: The `--allow-fs-read` flag is used to grant read access to specific directories, but the code is attempting to check if a process has permission to read a file in a directory that is not explicitly granted access. This can be exploited to escalate permissions and gain access to sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should only attempt to check for permissions in directories that are explicitly granted access using the `--allow-fs-read` flag. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not attempting to access sensitive information. The `--allow-fs-read` flag should be used judiciously and only for directories that require read access. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other types of attacks.  The `assert.ok` statements should be reviewed to ensure they are not being
