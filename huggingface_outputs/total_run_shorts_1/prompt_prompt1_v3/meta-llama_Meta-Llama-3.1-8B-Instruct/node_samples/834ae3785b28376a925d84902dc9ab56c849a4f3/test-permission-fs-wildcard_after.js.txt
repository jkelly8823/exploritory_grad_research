 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a permission bypass attack. The `--allow-fs-read` flags are used to grant read access to specific directories, but the `assert.ok(process.permission.has('fs.read', '/etc/passwd.*'))` line attempts to read a file with a wildcard in the path, which could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `--allow-fs-read` flags are used to grant read access to specific directories, but the `assert.ok(process.permission.has('fs.read', '/etc/passwd.*'))` line attempts to read a file with a wildcard in the path. This could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive files outside of the intended directory. The `process.permission.has` function is used to check if the process has permission to read a file, but the wildcard in the path could be used to read files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to remove the wildcard in the path. Instead of using `'/etc/passwd.*'`, the code should use `'/etc/passwd'` to
