VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a wildcard character (`*`) in the `--allow-fs-read` flag, which can allow read access to unintended directories.
EXPLANATION: The `--allow-fs-read` flag is used to specify directories that can be read by the system. However, the use of a wildcard character (`*`) can lead to unintended consequences, such as allowing read access to sensitive directories or files. This is because the wildcard character will match any characters after it, potentially including directory separators and file names. For example, the flag `--allow-fs-read=/home/test*` will allow read access to `/home/test/file1` and `/home/test2`, but also to `/home/test/file1/subdir` and `/home/test2/subdir`, which may not be intended.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more specific path or to avoid using wildcard characters in the `--allow-fs-read` flag. Instead, use a path that explicitly specifies the directories or files that should be allowed to be read. For example, `--allow-f
