VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet allows read access to all files matching a wildcard pattern, potentially exposing sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The `--allow-fs-read` option is used with a wildcard pattern (`/home/test*`) that matches any file or directory under the `/home/test` directory. This allows an attacker to access sensitive information by manipulating the wildcard pattern to match files they are not authorized to access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, avoid using wildcard patterns with the `--allow-fs-read` option. Instead, specify the exact file or directory path that requires read access. If wildcard patterns are necessary, ensure they are carefully crafted to only match the intended files or directories. Additionally, consider implementing additional access controls, such as file system permissions or authentication mechanisms, to further restrict access to sensitive information.  Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a whitelist of allowed paths or using a more fine-grained permission model.
