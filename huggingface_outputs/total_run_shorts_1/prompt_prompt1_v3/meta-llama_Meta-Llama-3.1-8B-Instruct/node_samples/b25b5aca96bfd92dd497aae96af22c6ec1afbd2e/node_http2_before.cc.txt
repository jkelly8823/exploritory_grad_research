VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The destructor of the Http2Session class does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The destructor appears to be properly checking that the session is not in scope before freeing it, and it is resetting the session pointer to ensure that subsequent checks pass. The CHECK_EQ statement is also checking that the current nghttp2 memory is 0, which suggests that the destructor is properly cleaning up any resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The destructor appears to be properly implemented and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.  It is worth noting that the use of CHECK statements in the destructor may not be the best practice, as they can potentially throw exceptions and cause issues if not properly handled. However, this is not a vulnerability in the classical sense, but rather a design choice.  It may be worth considering using a more traditional error handling mechanism in the destructor.  However, this is not a critical issue and does not affect the overall security of the code.  The code is properly cleaning up resources and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.  It is worth noting that the use of CHECK statements in the destructor may not be the best practice, as
