VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a destructor for an Http2Session class. It properly cleans up resources by detaching all Http2Stream instances, clearing the streams map, and resetting the session pointer. This ensures that all memory held by the Http2Stream instances is released and the nghttp2 session is properly cleaned up.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is well-structured and follows best practices for destructor implementation. It checks that the session is not in scope before attempting to free it, and it explicitly resets the session pointer to ensure that the subsequent memory check passes. The use of a for loop to detach all Http2Stream instances ensures that all memory held by these instances is released.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure and properly cleans up resources in the destructor.  The use of CHECK macros for assertions is also a good practice. However, it would be beneficial to add a comment explaining why the CHECK_EQ(current_nghttp2_memory_, 0) is necessary, as it may not be immediately clear why this check is required.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to add a comment explaining why the session
