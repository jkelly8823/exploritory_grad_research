VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of regular expressions in the `urlparse` method. The regular expression pattern used in the `urlparse` method can be exploited to cause a catastrophic backtracking scenario, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression pattern used in the `urlparse` method is `r'^(?:[^/]+/)*[^/]+(?:\?|#[^/]+)?/?$'`. This pattern can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that contains a large number of nested parentheses, causing the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop and consume excessive resources. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression pattern should be modified to prevent catastrophic backtracking. One possible solution is to use a possessive quantifier (`+` instead of `*`) to prevent the regular expression engine from backtracking. For example: `r'^(?:[^/]+/)+[^/]+(?:\?|#[^/]+)?/?$'`. Additionally, the code
