VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. This occurs when a malicious user is able to inject a newline character into the HTTP response, allowing them to inject additional HTTP headers or responses.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks because it does not properly sanitize user input. In the test_url_with_newline_header_injection_rejected method, the host variable is set to a string that contains a newline character. This allows a malicious user to inject additional HTTP headers or responses into the HTTP response. The code also does not properly validate the HTTP response, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTTP headers or responses.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize user input and validate the HTTP response. This can be done by using a library such as urllib.parse to properly parse the URL and by validating the HTTP response against a set of expected headers and responses. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to handle HTTP responses, such as using a library like http.server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
