VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. This is because the code does not properly sanitize the HTTP response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious headers or responses.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks because it does not properly sanitize the HTTP response. In the test_url_path_with_newline_header_injection_rejected and test_url_host_with_newline_header_injection_rejected methods, the code creates a fake HTTP response with a newline character in the header. This allows an attacker to inject malicious headers or responses by manipulating the HTTP response. The code also does not properly escape special characters in the URL, which can lead to HTTP response splitting attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the HTTP response by removing any newline characters and properly escaping special characters in the URL. This can be done by using a library such as urllib.parse to properly escape special characters in the URL. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to create the fake HTTP response, such as using a library that properly sanitizes the response.
