VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a SSL/TLS vulnerability known as "SSL 3.0 POODLE" (CVE-2014-3566). This vulnerability occurs when the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option is not disabled.
EXPLANATION: The SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option is not disabled, which allows an attacker to exploit the SSL 3.0 POODLE vulnerability. This option is used to prevent a specific type of attack, but it is not necessary for modern SSL/TLS implementations. Disabling this option is a recommended best practice to prevent this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS option should be disabled by removing the ~ operator, which would result in the following code: SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL & SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS);. This will prevent the SSL 3.0 POODLE vulnerability from being exploited. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure protocol version, such as TLS 1.2 or higher, and to verify the server's identity using a
