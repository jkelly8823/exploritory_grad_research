VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `recv(1)` method in a non-blocking mode. This can lead to a situation where the socket is stuck in a non-blocking state, causing the program to hang indefinitely.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `recv(1)` method is called in a non-blocking mode, which means that it will not block the program if no data is available to be received. However, if the socket is not connected, the `recv(1)` method will raise an `OSError` exception with an `errno` value of `ENOTCONN`. In this case, the code catches the exception and sets `notconn_pre_handshake_data` to an empty byte string. However, if the socket is connected but no data is available to be received, the `recv(1)` method will not block the program, but it will return an empty byte string. In this case, the code will incorrectly assume that the socket is not connected and will raise an `SSLError` exception. This can lead to a situation
