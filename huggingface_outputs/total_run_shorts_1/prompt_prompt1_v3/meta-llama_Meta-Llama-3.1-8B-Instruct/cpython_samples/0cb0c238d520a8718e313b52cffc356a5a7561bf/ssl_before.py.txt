VULNERABLE_LINES: 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of error handling for the SSL object creation. If an exception occurs during the creation of the SSL object, it will not be caught and will propagate up the call stack, potentially causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to create an SSL object using the `try` block, but it does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during this process. If an exception is raised, it will not be caught and will propagate up the call stack, potentially causing the program to crash or become unresponsive. This is a security vulnerability because it allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by creating an SSL object that raises an exception.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the creation of the SSL object. This can be done by adding a `except` block to catch any exceptions that may be raised and handle them accordingly. For example:

```
try:
    # create the SSL object
    ssl_obj = ssl
