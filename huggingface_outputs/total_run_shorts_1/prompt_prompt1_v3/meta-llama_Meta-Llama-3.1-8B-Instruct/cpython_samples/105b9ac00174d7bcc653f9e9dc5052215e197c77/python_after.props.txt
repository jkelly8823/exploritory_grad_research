VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the `Condition` attribute to evaluate the value of `$(ExternalsDir)`. However, it does not properly sanitize the input, which can lead to command injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the value of `$(ExternalsDir)` to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a safe method to evaluate the input, such as using the `Path.GetFullPath` method to ensure the path is properly sanitized. Additionally, consider using a library like `System.IO.Path` to help prevent path traversal attacks. For example, you can use `Path.Combine` to safely combine paths and prevent directory traversal. ```csharp
string externalsDir = Path.GetFullPath("$(PySourcePath)externals");
string sanitizedExternalsDir = Path.Combine(externalsDir, "sqlite-3.37.2.0");
``` ```python
import os
externals_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join("$(PySourcePath)", "externals"))
sanitized_externals_dir = os.path.join(
