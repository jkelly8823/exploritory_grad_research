VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to command injection attacks. This is because the variables %libraries% are being concatenated with external library names without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the library names. For example, if an attacker sets the variable %libraries% to something like "; rm -rf /", the command would execute the rm command, leading to a potential security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to concatenate the library names, such as using a parameterized query or a library that supports parameterized queries. Alternatively, the code could use a whitelist approach to only allow specific library names. Additionally, the code should validate user input to prevent any malicious commands from being injected. The code should also consider using a secure method to execute the command, such as using a library that supports secure command execution.  The code should also consider using a secure method to set the variables, such as using a library that supports secure variable setting.  The code should also consider using a secure method
