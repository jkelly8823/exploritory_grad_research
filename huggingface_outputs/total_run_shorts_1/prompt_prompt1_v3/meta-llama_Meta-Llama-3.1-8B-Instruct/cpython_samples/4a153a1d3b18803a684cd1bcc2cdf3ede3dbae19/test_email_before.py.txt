VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential email header injection attack. This is because the `utils.getaddresses` function is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious email addresses.
EXPLANATION: The `utils.getaddresses` function is used to parse email addresses from a string. However, it does not properly handle cases where the input string contains malicious characters, such as `[]*-- =~$`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious email addresses, potentially leading to email header injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `utils.getaddresses` function should be modified to properly sanitize the input string. This can be done by using a library such as `email.utils` to parse the email addresses, which is designed to handle malicious input. Additionally, the function should be updated to handle cases where the input string contains embedded comments, as seen in the `test_getaddresses_embedded_comment` test case. This can be done by using a regular expression to remove any embedded comments from the input string before parsing the email addresses. ```python
import email.utils

def getaddresses(email_string):
    # Remove any embedded comments from the
