VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression with a large number of possible matches.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `r'[][\\()<>@,:;".]'` has a large number of possible matches, which can cause the regular expression engine to take a long time to execute or even crash if the input is carefully crafted. This is a classic example of a ReDoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be optimized to have a more limited number of possible matches. One way to do this is to use a more specific regular expression that only matches the specific characters that are expected. For example, the regular expression could be changed to `r'[\[\]\\()<>@,:;".]'`. Additionally, the regular expression engine can be configured to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the `re.DOTALL` flag, to reduce the number of possible matches. Finally, the input should be validated to prevent malicious input from causing the regular expression engine to take a long time to execute.  The function
