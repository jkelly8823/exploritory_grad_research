VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `get_int_max_str_digits` function without proper validation of the input string length.
EXPLANATION: The `get_int_max_str_digits` function is used to set the maximum string digits limit for non-binary int<->str conversions. However, the function does not perform any validation on the input string length, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the expected length. This can result in arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input string length before passing it to the `get_int_max_str_digits` function. This can be done by checking the length of the input string and ensuring it does not exceed the expected length. Additionally, consider using a safer function that performs bounds checking on the input string. If the `get_int_max_str_digits` function is not available, consider using a different function that is safer and more secure.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all input validation is performed correctly and that all potential security vulnerabilities are addressed.  It is also recommended
