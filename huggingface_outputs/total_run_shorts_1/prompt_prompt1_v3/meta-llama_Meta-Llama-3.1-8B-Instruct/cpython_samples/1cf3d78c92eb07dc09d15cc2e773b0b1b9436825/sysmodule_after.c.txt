VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a CPython extension module, and it does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a part of a CPython extension module, and it appears to be a correct implementation of the sys.get_int_max_str_digits function. The function returns the maximum string digits limit for non-binary int<->str conversions, which is stored in the interp->long_state.max_str_digits variable. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or other common security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are provided, as the code snippet appears to be a correct implementation of the sys.get_int_max_str_digits function. However, it is always a good practice to review the code and ensure that it is correct and secure. Additionally, the code should be reviewed for any potential issues related to the interp->long_state.max_str_digits variable, such as ensuring that it is properly initialized and updated.  Please note that this code is part of a larger CPython extension module, and it is assumed that the rest of the code is also correct
