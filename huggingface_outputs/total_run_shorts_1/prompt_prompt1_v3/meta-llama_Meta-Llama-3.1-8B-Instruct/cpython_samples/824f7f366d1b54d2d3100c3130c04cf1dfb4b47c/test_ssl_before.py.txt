 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential certificate validation issue due to the use of a non-existent certificate file ("XXXnonexisting.pem") and a potentially malicious certificate file ("badkey.pem").
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to load certificates from files, but one of the files ("XXXnonexisting.pem") does not exist, which could lead to a certificate validation error. Additionally, the code loads a certificate from a file named "badkey.pem", which could potentially be a malicious certificate. This could allow an attacker to intercept or impersonate a legitimate certificate, leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the certificate files exist and are valid. Verify the authenticity of the certificate files and ensure they are not tampered with. Consider using a trusted certificate authority to obtain certificates. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as certificate pinning or revocation checking, to further mitigate potential certificate validation issues.  Also, consider using a secure way to load the certificates, such as using a secure protocol like HTTPS.  Finally, consider using a library that can handle certificate validation for you, such as cryptography.  This will
