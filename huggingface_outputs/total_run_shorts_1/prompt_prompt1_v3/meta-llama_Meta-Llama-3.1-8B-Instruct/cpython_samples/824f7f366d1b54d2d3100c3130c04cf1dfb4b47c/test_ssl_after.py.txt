VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a certificate parsing vulnerability, specifically CVE-2013-4073, due to the presence of null bytes in the certificate subject and subjectAltName fields.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a certificate parsing vulnerability due to the presence of null bytes in the certificate subject and subjectAltName fields. This is a known issue, CVE-2013-4073, which can be exploited to bypass certificate validation checks. The presence of null bytes in the certificate fields can cause the parsing code to malfunction, leading to incorrect certificate validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle null bytes in the certificate subject and subjectAltName fields. This can be achieved by using a library that is immune to this vulnerability, such as OpenSSL, or by implementing custom certificate parsing code that correctly handles null bytes. Additionally, the code should be updated to raise an error when encountering null bytes in the certificate fields, rather than attempting to parse them. This will help prevent the vulnerability from being exploited. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the test_parse_cert_CVE_2013_4238 and test
