VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of error handling and the repeated use of the readline() method without checking for the end of the file.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided contains several lines that are vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The issue lies in the repeated use of the readline() method without checking for the end of the file. This can lead to an infinite loop if the file is empty or if the connection is closed. Additionally, the lack of error handling makes it difficult to detect and handle errors, which can further exacerbate the issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to include proper error handling and checks for the end of the file. This can be achieved by adding a check for the end of the file after each readline() call and by using a try-except block to catch and handle any errors that may
