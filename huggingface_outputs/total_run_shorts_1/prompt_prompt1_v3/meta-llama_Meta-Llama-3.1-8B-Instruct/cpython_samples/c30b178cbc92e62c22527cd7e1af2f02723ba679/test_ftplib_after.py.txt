VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `collect_incoming_data` method does not properly handle the `self.rest` variable, which can lead to a buffer overflow when `self.dtp.push` is called with a large value of `offset`.
EXPLANATION: The `collect_incoming_data` method checks if `self.rest` is an integer, but it does not check if it is a non-negative integer. If `self.rest` is a large negative integer, the `offset` variable will be set to a large value, causing `self.dtp.push` to be called with a large value of `offset`. This can lead to a buffer overflow, as `self.dtp.push` may attempt to write more data to the buffer than it is allocated to hold.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `collect_incoming_data` method should be modified to check if `self.rest` is a non-negative integer before setting the
