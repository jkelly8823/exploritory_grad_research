VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `collect_incoming_data` method does not properly validate the length of the `data` parameter, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `collect_incoming_data` method appends the `data` parameter to the `in_buffer` list without checking its length. If an attacker sends a large amount of data, it can overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `collect_incoming_data` method should be modified to properly validate the length of the `data` parameter. This can be done by checking the length of the `data` parameter before appending it to the `in_buffer` list. Additionally, consider using a more secure data structure, such as a ring buffer, to prevent buffer overflows. The `cmd_list` method is also vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, as it pushes the `MLSD_DATA` string to the `dtp` object without checking its length. This should also be modified to
