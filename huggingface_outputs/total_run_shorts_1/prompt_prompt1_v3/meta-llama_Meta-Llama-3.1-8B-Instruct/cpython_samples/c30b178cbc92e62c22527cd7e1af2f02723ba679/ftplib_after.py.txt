VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation and handling of large responses from the FTP server. The getline() method can raise an Error exception when it receives more than MAXLINE bytes, but it does not handle the case when the server sends a large response that exceeds the maximum allowed size. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the server sends a large response and the client becomes unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The getline() method is designed to read one line from the server, but it does not handle the case when the server sends a large response that exceeds the maximum allowed size. The method raises an Error exception when it receives more than MAXLINE bytes, but it does not provide a way to handle this situation. This can lead to
