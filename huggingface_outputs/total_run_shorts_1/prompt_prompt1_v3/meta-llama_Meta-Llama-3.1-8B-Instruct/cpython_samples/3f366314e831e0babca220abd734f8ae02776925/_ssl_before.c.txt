VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocol downgrade attacks due to the use of SSL_OP_ALL and SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2/SSLv3 flags.
EXPLANATION: The use of SSL_OP_ALL flag enables all available SSL/TLS protocol versions, including SSLv2 and SSLv3, which are known to be vulnerable to various attacks. Additionally, the use of SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 and SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 flags is inconsistent with the SSL_OP_ALL flag, as it disables the very protocols that are enabled by SSL_OP_ALL. This inconsistency can lead to a protocol downgrade attack, where an attacker can force the client to use a vulnerable protocol version.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the SSL_OP_ALL flag and use the SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 and SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 flags consistently to disable all vulnerable protocol versions. Additionally, consider using a more secure protocol version, such as TLS 1.2 or later, by setting the SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 flag. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL
