VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocol downgrade attack due to the lack of proper protocol version selection.
EXPLANATION: The code sets the SSL protocol version to TLSv1 using the line `SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL & ~SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS);`, but then it adds constants for disabling SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols. However, the `SSL_OP_ALL` option includes the `SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS` option, which is not removed in the `SSL_CTX_set_options` call. This allows an attacker to downgrade the protocol version to SSLv2 or SSLv3 by inserting an empty fragment into the handshake.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the `SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS` option from the `SSL_CTX_set_options` call to prevent the protocol downgrade attack. Additionally, ensure that the SSL protocol version is properly selected and configured to prevent other potential vulnerabilities. For example, consider using `SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version` and `SSL_CTX_set_max_proto_version` to set the minimum and maximum allowed protocol
