VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a file transfer or data reading mechanism. It reads data from a file in chunks, appending each chunk to a list, and then joins the list into a single string. The code checks for the end of the file by reading a chunk and checking if it's empty. This is a common and safe way to read large files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code looks safe and well-structured. However, it's worth noting that the use of a while loop and a list to store the chunks might be inefficient for very large files. Consider using a more memory-efficient approach, such as reading the file in chunks directly into a string. But this is not a vulnerability, just a potential performance improvement.  ```python
def get_user_input():
    user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
    return user_input

def greet_user(user_name):
    print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")

def main():
    user_name = get_user_input()
    greet_user(user_name)
