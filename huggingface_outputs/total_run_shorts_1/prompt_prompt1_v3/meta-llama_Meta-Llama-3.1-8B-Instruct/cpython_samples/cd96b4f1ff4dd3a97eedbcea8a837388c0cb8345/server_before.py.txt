VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the `min` function to determine the chunk size. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the `size_remaining` variable to exceed the maximum allowed chunk size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `min` function is used to determine the chunk size, which is then used to read data from the file. However, if an attacker can manipulate the `size_remaining` variable to be larger than the `max_chunk_size`, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This is because the `min` function will return the smaller of the two values, but if the attacker can make `size_remaining` larger than `max_chunk_size`, it will not be caught by the `min` function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer approach to determine the chunk size, such as using a constant value or a more secure method to calculate the chunk size. Additionally, consider adding input validation to ensure that the `size_remaining` variable is within a safe range. It is also recommended to use a secure method to read data from the file, such
