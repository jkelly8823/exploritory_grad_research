VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the ssl.match_hostname function with a None or empty dictionary as the first argument. This can cause the function to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The ssl.match_hostname function is designed to match the hostname of a server against a list of allowed hostnames. However, if the first argument is None or an empty dictionary, the function will enter an infinite loop, causing a denial-of-service. This is because the function will continue to try to match the hostname against the empty list, never terminating.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the first argument to the ssl.match_hostname function is a non-empty dictionary. This can be done by adding a simple check before calling the function. For example: if not hostname: raise ValueError("Hostname cannot be empty") before calling ssl.match_hostname(hostname, 'example.com'). Alternatively, the code can use a more robust hostname matching function that is designed to handle empty hostnames.  ```python
if not hostname:
    raise ValueError
