VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `tok` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `tok` variable is not checked for its size before being used in the comparison with `XML_TOK_PARAM_ENTITY_REF`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `tok` contains a value larger than the expected size, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking on the `tok` variable to ensure it does not exceed the expected size. This can be done by adding a simple `if` statement to check the size of `tok` before using it in the comparison. For example: `if (sizeof(tok) <= sizeof(XML_TOK_PARAM_ENTITY_REF)) {... }`. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a `uint32_t`, to store the value of `tok`. This will help prevent buffer overflows and ensure the code is more secure.  ```c
if (sizeof(tok) <= sizeof(XML_TOK_PARAM_ENTITY_REF)) {
  if (! state->documentEntity && tok == XML_TOK_PARAM_ENTITY_REF)
