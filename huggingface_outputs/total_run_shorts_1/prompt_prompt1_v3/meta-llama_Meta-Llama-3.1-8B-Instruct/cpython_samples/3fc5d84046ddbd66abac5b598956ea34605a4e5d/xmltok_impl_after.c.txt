VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking in the LEAD_CASE macro.
EXPLANATION: The LEAD_CASE macro is used to handle different byte order marks (BOMs) in the input stream. However, it does not check if the pointer `ptr` is within the valid range of the input buffer before incrementing it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input stream contains a BOM that is larger than the allocated buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the LEAD_CASE macro should be modified to check if the pointer `ptr` is within the valid range of the input buffer before incrementing it. This can be done by adding a bounds check, such as `if (ptr + n <= end) {... }`. Additionally, the `MINBPC` macro should be used to ensure that the pointer is incremented by the correct number of bytes. ```c
#define LEAD_CASE(n)                                                         \
  case BT_LEAD##n:                                                             \
    if (ptr + n <= end) {                                                     \
      ptr += n;                                                                 \
