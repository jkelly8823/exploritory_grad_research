VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `findEncoding` does not check for buffer overflow when copying the encoding string into the `buf` array. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability if the encoding string is longer than `ENCODING_MAX` characters.
EXPLANATION: The function `findEncoding` uses the `XmlUtf8Convert` function to convert the encoding string into the `buf` array. However, it does not check if the encoding string is longer than the `buf` array can hold. If the encoding string is longer than `ENCODING_MAX` characters, it can overflow the `buf` array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function `findEncoding` should check the length of the encoding string before copying it into the `buf` array. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to get the length of the encoding string and comparing it to the size of the `buf` array. If the length of the encoding string is greater than the size of the `buf` array, the function should either allocate a larger buffer or truncate the encoding string to fit within
