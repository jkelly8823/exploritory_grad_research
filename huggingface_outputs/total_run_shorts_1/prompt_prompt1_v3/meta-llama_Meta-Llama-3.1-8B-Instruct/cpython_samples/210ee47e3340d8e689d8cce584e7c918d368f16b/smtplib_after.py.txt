 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23, 24
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation on the `line` variable. An attacker could send a specially crafted packet that causes the `readline` method to block indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
EXPLANATION: The `readline` method is called with a buffer size of `_MAXLINE + 1`, which is a large value. However, the `readline` method does not perform any input validation on the data it reads. An attacker could send a packet with a large amount of data that causes the `readline` method to block indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is a potential vulnerability because it allows an attacker to cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform input validation on the `line` variable to prevent an attacker from sending a large amount of data that causes the `readline` method to block indefinitely. This can be done by checking the length of the `line` variable and raising an exception if
