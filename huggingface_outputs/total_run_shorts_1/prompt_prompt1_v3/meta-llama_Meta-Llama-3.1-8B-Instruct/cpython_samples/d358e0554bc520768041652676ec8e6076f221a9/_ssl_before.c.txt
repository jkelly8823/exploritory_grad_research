 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SSL/TLS downgrade attack due to the use of SSL_OP_ALL, which enables SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols. This can allow an attacker to downgrade the connection to an insecure protocol.
EXPLANATION: The use of SSL_OP_ALL enables all possible SSL/TLS options, including the insecure SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols. This can be exploited by an attacker to downgrade the connection to an insecure protocol, potentially allowing them to intercept or modify sensitive data. The use of SSL_VERIFY_PEER is not sufficient to mitigate this vulnerability, as it only verifies the peer's certificate, but does not prevent the downgrade attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to explicitly disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols using SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 and SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3 options. This can be done by replacing the line `SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_ALL);` with `SSL_CTX_set_options(self->ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 | SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3);`. Additionally, the code should be updated to use the more
