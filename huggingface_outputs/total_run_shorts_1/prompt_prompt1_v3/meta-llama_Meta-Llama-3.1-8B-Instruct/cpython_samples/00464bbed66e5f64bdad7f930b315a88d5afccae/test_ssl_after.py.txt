VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `os.path.join()` function is used to construct a path to the certificate file, but the `os.path.dirname(__file__)` expression may return a relative path that can be manipulated by an attacker.
EXPLANATION: The `os.path.dirname(__file__)` expression returns the directory name of the current file. However, if the current file is a symbolic link, this expression will return the directory name of the symbolic link, not the actual directory name of the file it points to. This can be exploited by an attacker to traverse the directory tree and access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the `os.path.abspath()` function to ensure that the path to the certificate file is absolute. This can be done by replacing the line `certfile = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__) or os.curdir, certfile)` with `certfile = os.path.abspath(certfile)`. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to construct the path to the certificate file, such as using a library like `pathlib`
