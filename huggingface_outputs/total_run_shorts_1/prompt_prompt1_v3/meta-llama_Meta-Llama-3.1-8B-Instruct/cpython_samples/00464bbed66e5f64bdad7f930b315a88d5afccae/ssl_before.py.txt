 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SSL/TLS protocol downgrade attack. This is because the ssl_version parameter is set to PROTOCOL_TLS, which is a specific version of the SSL/TLS protocol. An attacker could potentially manipulate the client to use an older version of the SSL/TLS protocol, which could be vulnerable to known attacks.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the PROTOCOL_TLS constant, which is a specific version of the SSL/TLS protocol. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the client to use an older version of the SSL/TLS protocol, which could be vulnerable to known attacks. The use of a specific protocol version is generally not recommended, as it can make the application vulnerable to protocol downgrade attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use the PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 constant instead of PROTOCOL_TLS. This will ensure that the application uses the latest version of the SSL/TLS protocol, which is more secure. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the client does not support the latest version of the SSL/TLS protocol. This can be done by checking
