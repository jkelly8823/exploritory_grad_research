VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SSL/TLS protocol downgrade attack. This is because the code is setting the SSLContext object's class to SSLObject, which is a class that is known to be vulnerable to this type of attack.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the SSLContext object's sslobject_class attribute to set the class of the SSL object. However, the SSLObject class is known to be vulnerable to SSL/TLS protocol downgrade attacks. This type of attack allows an attacker to force the client to use a weaker SSL/TLS protocol, potentially allowing the attacker to intercept sensitive information. This is a serious security vulnerability that should be addressed immediately.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure class for the SSL object, such as the SSLContext object's default class. This can be done by removing the line that sets the sslobject_class attribute, or by using a more secure class that is not vulnerable to this type of attack. Additionally, the code should be updated to use a secure SSL/TLS protocol, such as TLS 1.2 or later. This can be done by setting
