 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A resource leak is present due to the use of goto statements. The goto statement can cause the function to exit prematurely, skipping the cleanup code and leading to resource leaks.
EXPLANATION: The use of goto statements can make the code harder to understand and maintain. In this case, the goto statement is used to exit the function early, but it can also cause the cleanup code to be skipped. This can lead to resource leaks, as the resources allocated in the function are not properly freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more structured approach to handle errors, such as using a try-except block or a return statement. This will ensure that the cleanup code is executed properly, even if an error occurs. Additionally, consider using a linter or code analysis tool to detect potential issues with the use of goto statements.  ```python
def load_data(state, self, file_obj):
    data_tuple = None

    utcoff = None
    dstoff = None

    try:
        # code that might raise an exception
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        # handle the exception
        pass
