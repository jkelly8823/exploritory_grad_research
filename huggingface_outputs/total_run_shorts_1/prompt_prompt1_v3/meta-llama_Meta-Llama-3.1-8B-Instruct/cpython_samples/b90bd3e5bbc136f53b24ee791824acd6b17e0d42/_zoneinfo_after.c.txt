VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A resource leak is present due to the lack of proper cleanup of the utcoff and dstoff pointers.
EXPLANATION: The utcoff and dstoff pointers are allocated but not freed in the event of an error. This can lead to a resource leak, where memory is allocated but not released, causing the program to consume increasing amounts of memory over time.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The utcoff and dstoff pointers should be freed in the error handling block to prevent resource leaks. This can be done by adding the necessary code to free the memory allocated for these pointers. For example: free(utcoff); free(dstoff); in the error handling block. Additionally, it would be a good practice to check for NULL before freeing the pointers to avoid potential crashes.  ```free(utcoff); free(dstoff);``` should be replaced with ```if (utcoff!= NULL) free(utcoff); if (dstoff!= NULL) free(dstoff);``` to prevent crashes. ```
