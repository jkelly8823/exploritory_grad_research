VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 11, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a hostname spoofing attack. This is because the code does not properly validate the hostname before passing it to the SSL library. Specifically, the code does not check if the hostname is a valid domain name or if it is a valid IP address.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the hostname is not None, but it does not check if the hostname is a valid domain name or IP address. This allows an attacker to pass a hostname that is not a valid domain name or IP address, which can lead to a hostname spoofing attack. The code also does not check if the hostname is a valid IDN A-label (ASCII str), which can also lead to a hostname spoofing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the hostname is a valid domain name or IP address before passing it to the SSL library. This can be done by using a library such as dns.resolver to check if the hostname is a valid domain name. The code should also check if the hostname is a valid IDN A-label (ASCII str) before passing it to the SSL
