VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Server Name Indication (SNI) vulnerability. This is because the server_hostname parameter is being passed a string that contains a null character (\x00), which can be used to inject malicious data.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the server_hostname parameter is being passed a string that contains a null character (\x00). This can be used to inject malicious data, potentially leading to a Server Name Indication (SNI) vulnerability. The null character is being used to separate the legitimate domain name from the malicious domain name. This is a classic example of a SNI vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the server_hostname parameter should be sanitized to remove any null characters. This can be done using the str.replace() method or a similar approach. Additionally, it's a good practice to validate the input to prevent such vulnerabilities in the future. For example, the server_hostname parameter could be checked to ensure it only contains valid characters.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles the case where the server_hostname parameter is not provided.  This could involve adding a
