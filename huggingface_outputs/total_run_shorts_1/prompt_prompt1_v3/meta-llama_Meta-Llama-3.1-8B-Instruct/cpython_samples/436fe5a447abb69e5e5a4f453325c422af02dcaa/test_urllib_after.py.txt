VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a proxy bypass attack. The proxy bypass list is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which could allow an attacker to bypass the proxy and make requests directly to the server.
EXPLANATION: The proxy bypass list is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which could allow an attacker to bypass the proxy and make requests directly to the server. This is a security risk because it could allow an attacker to make requests to the server without going through the proxy, potentially allowing them to bypass any security measures that are in place.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove 'anotherdomain.com' from the proxy bypass list. This can be done by modifying the line where the proxy bypass list is set to exclude 'anotherdomain.com'. For example: self.env.set('NO_PROXY', 'localhost, newdomain.com') would remove 'anotherdomain.com' from the proxy bypass list. Additionally, consider implementing a more secure proxy bypass mechanism, such as using a whitelist of allowed domains.  Also, the test case should be updated to test the correct behavior of the proxy bypass list.  The test case should verify that the proxy bypass list is correctly applied
