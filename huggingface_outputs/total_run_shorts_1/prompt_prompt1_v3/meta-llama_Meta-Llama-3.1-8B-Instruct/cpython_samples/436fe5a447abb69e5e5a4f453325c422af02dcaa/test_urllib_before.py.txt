VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a proxy bypass attack. The 'NO_PROXY' environment variable is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which is then used to bypass the proxy for the same domain.
EXPLANATION: The 'NO_PROXY' environment variable is used to bypass the proxy for certain domains. However, in this case, it is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which is then used to bypass the proxy for the same domain. This allows an attacker to bypass the proxy and make requests to the domain without being intercepted.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove 'anotherdomain.com' from the 'NO_PROXY' environment variable or use a more secure method to bypass the proxy. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to set environment variables, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable manager.  Also, consider using a more secure method to handle proxy bypass, such as using a whitelist of allowed domains.  Consider using a library like `requests` which has built-in support for proxy bypass.  Consider using a library like `urllib3` which has built-in support for proxy bypass.  Consider using a library like `httpx
