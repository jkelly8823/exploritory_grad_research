 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function proxy_bypass_environment is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack. This is because the function does not properly sanitize the input parameter host.
EXPLANATION: The function proxy_bypass_environment takes a parameter host, which is not validated or sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the host parameter. For example, if the host parameter is set to 'example.com OR 1=1', the function may return True, allowing the attacker to bypass proxy settings.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should validate and sanitize the input parameter host. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides input validation and sanitization. Additionally, the function should be updated to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.````
