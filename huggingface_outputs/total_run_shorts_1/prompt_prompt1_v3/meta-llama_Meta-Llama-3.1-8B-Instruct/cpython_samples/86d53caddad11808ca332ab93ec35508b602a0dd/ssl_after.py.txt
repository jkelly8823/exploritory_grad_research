 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a function that converts a DNS name to a pattern. It checks for the number of wildcards in each fragment of the DNS name and raises a CertificateError if more than one wildcard is found. This is a reasonable choice based on established policy among SSL implementations. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be secure and well-written.  ```python
def _dnsname_to_pat(dn, max_wildcards=1):
    pats = []
    for frag in dn.split(r'.'):
        if frag.count('*') > max_wildcards:
            # Issue #17980: avoid denials of service by refusing more
            # than one wildcard per fragment.  A survery of established
            # policy among SSL implementations showed it to be a
            # reasonable choice.
            raise CertificateError(
                "too many wildcards in certificate DNS name: " + repr(dn))
        if frag == '*':
            # When '*'
