VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that is used to convert a DNS name to a pattern. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The use of regular expressions is safe and does not pose any risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be secure and does not require any changes.  ```python
def _dnsname_to_pat(dn):
    pats = []
    for frag in dn.split(r'.'):
        if frag == '*':
            # When '*' is a fragment by itself, it matches a non-empty dotless
            # fragment.
            pats.append('[^.]+')
``` 
However, it is worth noting that the function does not handle the case where the input string is empty. This could potentially lead to an error if the function is called with an empty string. To fix this, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to return an empty list if the input string is empty.  ```python
def _dnsname_to_pat
