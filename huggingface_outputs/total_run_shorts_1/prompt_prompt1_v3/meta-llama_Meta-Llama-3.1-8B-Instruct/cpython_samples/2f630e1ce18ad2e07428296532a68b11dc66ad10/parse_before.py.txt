VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a URL parsing function. It defines a list of unsafe bytes to be removed from URLs and a function to clear the cache. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or buffer overflows. However, it's worth noting that the code is using the `replace()` method to remove unsafe bytes from URLs, which may not be the most efficient or secure approach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Consider using a more efficient and secure approach to remove unsafe bytes from URLs, such as using a regular expression or a dedicated URL parsing library. Additionally, consider adding input validation and sanitization to ensure that the input URLs are properly formatted and do not contain any malicious characters.  ```python
import re

def clear_cache():
    #...

    for b in _UNSAFE_URL_BYTES_TO_REMOVE:
        url = re.sub(b, "", url)
        scheme = re.sub(b, "", scheme)
``` ```python
import urllib.parse

def clear_cache():
    #...

    for b in
