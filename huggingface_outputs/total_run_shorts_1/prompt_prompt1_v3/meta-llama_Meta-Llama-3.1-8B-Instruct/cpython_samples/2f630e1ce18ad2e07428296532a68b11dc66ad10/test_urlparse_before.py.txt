VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of the `javascript:` protocol in the `geturl()` method. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL.
EXPLANATION: The `geturl()` method returns a URL that includes a `javascript:` protocol, which can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code. This is a classic example of an XSS vulnerability. The `javascript:` protocol is not a valid protocol for HTTP URLs, and its presence in the URL can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to remove the `javascript:` protocol from the URL. This can be done by using the `urllib.parse.urlparse()` function to parse the URL and then removing the `javascript:` protocol from the `scheme` attribute. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a safer URL parsing library that does not allow the `javascript:` protocol. For example, the `urlparse()` function from the `urllib.parse` module can be used instead of the `geturl()` method. Additionally, the code
