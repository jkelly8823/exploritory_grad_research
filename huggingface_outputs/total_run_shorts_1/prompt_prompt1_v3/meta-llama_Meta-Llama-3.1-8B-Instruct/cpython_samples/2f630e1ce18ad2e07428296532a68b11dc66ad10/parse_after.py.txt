VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression with a large number of possible matches.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression '0123456789' is used to match digits, but it is not anchored to the start of the string. This means that the regular expression engine will have to scan the entire string to find a match, which can lead to a denial of service if the string is very large. Additionally, the regular expression contains a large number of possible matches, which can also contribute to the ReDoS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be anchored to the start of the string using the '^' character. For example, the regular expression could be changed to '^0123456789'. This will prevent the regular expression engine from scanning the entire string and reduce the number of possible matches. Alternatively, the regular expression could be replaced with a more efficient and secure way of matching digits, such as using the '\d' character class. For example, the regular expression could be changed to '^[\d.]'.
