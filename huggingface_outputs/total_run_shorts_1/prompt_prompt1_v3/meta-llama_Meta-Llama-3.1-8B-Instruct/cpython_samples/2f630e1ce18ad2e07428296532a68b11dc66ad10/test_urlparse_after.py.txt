VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a URL parsing issue where it does not properly handle URLs with certain types of characters, such as JavaScript:alert() in the URL path. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the urllib.parse.urlsplit function to parse URLs, but it does not properly handle URLs with certain types of characters. Specifically, it does not remove JavaScript:alert() from the URL path, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. This is because the urlsplit function does not have a built-in mechanism to remove malicious characters from the URL path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more robust URL parsing library, such as the urlsplit function from the python-urllib3 library, which has built-in support for removing malicious characters from the URL path. Alternatively, you can use a regular expression to remove JavaScript:alert() from the URL path before passing it to the urlsplit function. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure way to handle URLs, such as using a URL validation library to ensure that the URL is valid and
