VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string formatting with user input.
EXPLANATION: The line `self.push('+OK %s %s' %(arg, arg))` is using string formatting with the `arg` variable, which is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `arg` variable. The `arg` variable is not validated or sanitized, making it a potential entry point for an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, you can use the `sqlite3` module's `paramstyle` to parameterize the query. Alternatively, you can use an ORM like SQLAlchemy to abstract away the underlying database and prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, validate and sanitize user input to prevent any malicious code from being injected. 

Note: The code snippet is using the `sqlite3` module, but the vulnerability is still present due to the use of string formatting with user input.
