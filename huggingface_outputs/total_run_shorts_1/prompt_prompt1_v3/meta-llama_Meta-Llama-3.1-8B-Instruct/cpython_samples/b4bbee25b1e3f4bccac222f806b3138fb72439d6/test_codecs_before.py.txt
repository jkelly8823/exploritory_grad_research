VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a UnicodeDecodeError when decoding certain byte sequences. This is because the `codecs.utf_16_le_decode` and `codecs.utf_16_be_decode` functions are called with a byte sequence that contains a byte with the value 0xFF, which is not a valid Unicode character in UTF-16 encoding.
EXPLANATION: The `codecs.utf_16_le_decode` and `codecs.utf_16_be_decode` functions are designed to decode byte sequences into Unicode strings. However, when a byte sequence contains a byte with the value 0xFF, it can cause a UnicodeDecodeError. This is because 0xFF is not a valid Unicode character in UTF-16 encoding. The code is attempting to decode this byte sequence with the "strict" error handler, which will raise a UnicodeDecodeError when it encounters an invalid character.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle the case where the byte sequence contains a byte with the value 0xFF. This could be done by using a different error handler, such as "replace" or "ignore",
