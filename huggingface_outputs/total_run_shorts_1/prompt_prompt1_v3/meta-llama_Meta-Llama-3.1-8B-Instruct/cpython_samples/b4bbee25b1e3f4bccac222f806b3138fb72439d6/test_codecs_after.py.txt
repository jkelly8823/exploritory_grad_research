VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a UnicodeDecodeError when decoding certain byte sequences. This is because the code does not properly handle surrogate pairs and non-BMP characters.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the'strict' error handler when decoding the byte sequences, which means that it will raise a UnicodeDecodeError if it encounters an invalid byte sequence. However, the code is not properly handling surrogate pairs and non-BMP characters, which can lead to a UnicodeDecodeError. This is because the code is not checking if the byte sequence is a valid surrogate pair or non-BMP character before decoding it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the'replace' error handler instead of'strict'. This will replace any invalid byte sequences with a replacement character, such as '\ufffd', instead of raising a UnicodeDecodeError. Additionally, the code should check if the byte sequence is a valid surrogate pair or non-BMP character before decoding it. This can be done by checking if the byte sequence starts with the surrogate pair prefix '\xd8' or '\xdc'. If it does, the code should decode the byte
