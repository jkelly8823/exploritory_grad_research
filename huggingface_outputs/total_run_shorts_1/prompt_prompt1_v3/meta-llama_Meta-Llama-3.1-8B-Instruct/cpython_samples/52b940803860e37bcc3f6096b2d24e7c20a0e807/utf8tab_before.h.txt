 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 0xFC
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a vulnerability due to the presence of a malformed byte sequence.
EXPLANATION: The presence of BT_MALFORM indicates that the byte sequence is malformed, which can lead to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace BT_MALFORM with a valid byte sequence, and ensure that all byte sequences are properly formatted to prevent security vulnerabilities.  Ensure that all byte sequences are properly validated to prevent security vulnerabilities.  Consider using a library or framework that can handle byte sequences for you.
