VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the NS(findEncoding) function. The function uses a fixed-size buffer (buf) to store the converted encoding, but it does not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the converted encoding. If the converted encoding is larger than the buffer size (ENCODING_MAX), it can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The NS(findEncoding) function uses the XmlUtf8Convert function to convert the encoding from the input string to a UTF-8 encoding. The converted encoding is then stored in the buf buffer. However, the buf buffer has a fixed size of ENCODING_MAX, which is 128. If the converted encoding is larger than 128 bytes, it can overflow the buf buffer, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the converted encoding is larger than the buffer size before storing it in the buf buffer. This can be done by checking the return value of XmlUtf8Convert, which returns the number of bytes converted. If the number of bytes converted is larger than the buffer size, the function should return an error
