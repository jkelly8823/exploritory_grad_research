VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation and handling of large responses from the FTP server. The getline() method can raise an Error exception when it receives more than MAXLINE bytes, but it does not properly handle this situation, leading to a potential DoS attack.
EXPLANATION: The getline() method is designed to read one line from the FTP server, but it does not validate the input before processing it. If the FTP server sends a large response, the getline() method can raise an Error exception, but it does not properly handle this situation. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, where the FTP client is unable to process the response and becomes unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the
