VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string formatting with user input.
EXPLANATION: The line `self.push('+OK %s %s' %(arg, arg))` is using string formatting with the `arg` variable, which is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `arg` variable. The `arg` variable is not validated or sanitized, making it a potential entry point for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, you can use the `sqlite3` module's `paramstyle` to parameterize the query. Alternatively, you can use an ORM like SQLAlchemy to abstract away the SQL and prevent injection attacks. Additionally, validate and sanitize the `arg` variable to ensure it only contains expected input. 

Note: The code snippet is using the `sqlite3` module, but the vulnerability is still present due to the use of string formatting with user input.
