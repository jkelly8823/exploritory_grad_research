 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of validation of the length of the input line.
EXPLANATION: The code reads a line from the file using readline() and then checks if the line is empty. However, it does not check the length of the line, which can lead to a buffer overflow attack if a malicious user sends a line that is longer than the buffer size. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the line before processing it. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the length of the line is within a safe range. For example, the code can check if the length of the line is less than or equal to a certain threshold, such as 1024 bytes. If the length of the line exceeds this threshold, the code can raise an error or take other appropriate action to prevent the buffer overflow attack. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the line where the code checks if the line is empty, which is line 11. This is because the code does not check the length of
