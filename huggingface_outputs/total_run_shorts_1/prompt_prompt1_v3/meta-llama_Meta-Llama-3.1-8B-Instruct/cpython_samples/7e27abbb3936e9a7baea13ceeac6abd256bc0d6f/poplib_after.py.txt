 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The readline() function is called with a buffer size of _MAXLINE + 1, which is 2049. However, the check for a line length greater than _MAXLINE is performed after the readline() function has already read the line into the buffer. This means that if a line longer than _MAXLINE is read, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a crash or allow an attacker to inject malicious code.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the readline() function is called with a buffer size that is one character larger than the maximum allowed line length. This is done to prevent a buffer overflow, but it actually introduces a vulnerability. The check for a line length greater than _MAXLINE is performed after the readline() function has already read the line into the buffer, so if a line longer than _MAXLINE is read, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a crash or allow an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the readline() function should be called with a buffer size of _MAXLINE, not _MAXLINE
