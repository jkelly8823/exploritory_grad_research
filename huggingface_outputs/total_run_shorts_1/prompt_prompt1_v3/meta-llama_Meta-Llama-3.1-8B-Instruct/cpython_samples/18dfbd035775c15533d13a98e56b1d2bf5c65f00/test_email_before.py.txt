 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of the `=~` operator in the regular expression.
EXPLANATION: The `=~` operator is used in the regular expression `[]*-- =~$` which can cause the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop when processing certain inputs, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the `=~` operator with a more secure regular expression that does not use this operator. For example, you can use the `re.search` function to search for the pattern instead of using the `=~` operator. Additionally, consider using a more secure regular expression engine such as PCRE or ICU.  Also, consider using a library like `email-validator` to validate email addresses.  This will prevent the regular expression from being used in the first place.  This will prevent the ReDoS attack.  Also, consider using a library like `email-validator` to validate email addresses.
