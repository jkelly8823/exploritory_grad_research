 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of the `utils.getaddresses` function with untrusted input. This function uses regular expressions to parse email addresses, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking and a denial of service if the input is carefully crafted.
EXPLANATION: The `utils.getaddresses` function is used to parse email addresses from a list of strings. However, the function uses regular expressions to parse the input, which can lead to a ReDoS attack if the input is carefully crafted. The regular expression used in the function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is likely that it uses a pattern that can lead to catastrophic backtracking. This can happen when the input contains a large number of nested parentheses or other characters that can cause the regular expression engine to take a long time to process.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `utils.getaddresses` function should be modified to use a more robust regular expression that is resistant to ReDoS attacks. One possible solution is to use a regular expression that uses possessive quantifiers and atomic grouping to prevent
