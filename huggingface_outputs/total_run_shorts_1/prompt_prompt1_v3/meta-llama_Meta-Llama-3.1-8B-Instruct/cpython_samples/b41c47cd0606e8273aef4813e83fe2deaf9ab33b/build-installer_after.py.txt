 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a dictionary definition for a package, specifically OpenSSL 1.1.1t. It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is a simple dictionary definition that includes metadata about the OpenSSL package. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability, such as user input handling, database queries, or other security-sensitive operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it appears to be a straightforward and innocuous dictionary definition. However, it is always a good practice to ensure that any external dependencies, such as the OpenSSL package, are properly validated and secured in a production environment.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger build or installation process, and should be evaluated in that context.  Further, the use of a hardcoded checksum may be a security risk if the checksum is not properly validated.  Consider using a more secure method to validate the package integrity.
