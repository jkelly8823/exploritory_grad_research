VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the use of an insecure template engine. The template engine is being used to execute arbitrary code, which can lead to a command injection vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The template engine is being used to execute arbitrary code, which can lead to a command injection vulnerability. This is because the template engine is being used to generate a command that is executed by the operating system. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the template, which would be executed by the operating system, leading to a command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the template engine should be replaced with a safer alternative, such as a templating engine that uses a whitelist of allowed variables and does not execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the use of user-input data in the template should be avoided. The code should be reviewed to ensure that all user-input data is properly sanitized and validated before being used in the template. The template engine should also be configured to prevent the execution of arbitrary code. This can be done by setting the template engine to use a safe mode, such as "safe" or "strict", which will prevent
