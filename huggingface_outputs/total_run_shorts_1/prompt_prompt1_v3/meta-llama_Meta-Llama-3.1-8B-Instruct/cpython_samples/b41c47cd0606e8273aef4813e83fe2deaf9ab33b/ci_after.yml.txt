VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a command injection vulnerability. The variables section is used to define variables that are then used in the template. However, the variables section is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands. This is particularly concerning because the variables are used to construct the test run title and platform, which are then used to execute the posix-steps.yml template. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious command by manipulating the Build.SourceBranchName variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the variables section should be properly sanitized to prevent command injection. This can be achieved by using a library or framework that provides input validation and sanitization. Additionally, the variables should be validated and sanitized before being used to construct the test run title and platform. This can be done by using a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensuring that only expected characters are allowed. Furthermore, the posix-steps.yml template should be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to command injection. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides template engine security features.  The variables section should be reviewed to
