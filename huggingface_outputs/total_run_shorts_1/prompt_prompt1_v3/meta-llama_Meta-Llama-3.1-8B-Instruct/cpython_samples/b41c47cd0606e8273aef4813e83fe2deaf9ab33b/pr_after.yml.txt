VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a command injection vulnerability. The variables section is using the system.pullRequest.TargetBranch and Build.SourceBranchName variables without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating these variables. The./posix-steps.yml template is being used with parameters that are not properly sanitized, which can lead to command injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that all user-input variables are properly sanitized and validated before using them in commands. Use a library or function that can safely escape or quote user-input to prevent command injection attacks. Additionally, consider using a templating engine that supports safe templating and avoids the use of user-input in command construction. For example, you can use the Jinja2 templating engine, which has built-in support for safe templating and can help prevent command injection attacks.  Also, consider using a parameterized query approach to separate the command logic from the user-input variables. This will make it easier to identify and prevent command injection attacks.  Finally, ensure that the./posix-steps.yml template is properly validated and
