VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a maximum limit on the size of the data being read from the file. This can cause the program to consume excessive memory and potentially crash.
EXPLANATION: The code reads data from a file in chunks, but it does not check the total size of the data being read. This allows an attacker to send a large amount of data, causing the program to consume excessive memory and potentially crash. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a maximum limit on the size of the data being read from the file. You can do this by checking the total size of the data being read and stopping the loop when it reaches the maximum limit. For example, you can add a check like this: `if size_remaining > max_data_size: break`. You should also consider adding error handling to handle cases where the data being read is larger than the maximum limit.
