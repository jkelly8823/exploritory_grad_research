VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential proxy bypass attack. The 'NO_PROXY' environment variable is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which is then used to bypass the proxy for the same domain.
EXPLANATION: The 'NO_PROXY' environment variable is used to specify domains that should not be proxied. However, in this case, it is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which is then used to bypass the proxy for the same domain. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass the proxy and make requests to the domain without being detected.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove 'anotherdomain.com' from the 'NO_PROXY' environment variable or use a more secure method to bypass the proxy. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to set environment variables, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable manager.  The 'urllib.request.proxy_bypass_environment' function should be used with caution and only when necessary, as it can potentially allow an attacker to bypass the proxy.  Consider using a more secure method to handle proxy bypassing, such as using a whitelist of allowed domains.  The 'FakeHTTPMixin' class should
