 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a proxy bypass attack. The proxy bypass environment variable 'NO_PROXY' is set to include 'anotherdomain.com', which means that any request to 'anotherdomain.com' will bypass the proxy, potentially allowing an attacker to access internal resources.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is also vulnerable to a proxy bypass attack due to the 'REQUEST_METHOD' environment variable being set to 'GET' in the test_proxy_cgi_ignore method. This can allow an attacker to bypass the proxy by setting the 'REQUEST_METHOD' environment variable to 'GET' and making a request to a proxy server.
EXPLANATION: The 'NO_PROXY' environment variable is used to specify domains that should not be proxied. However, in this code, 'anotherdomain.com' is included in the 'NO_PROXY' list, which means that any request to 'anotherdomain.com' will bypass the proxy. This can be exploited by an attacker to access internal resources. Additionally, the 'REQUEST_METHOD' environment variable being set to 'GET' in the test_proxy_cgi_ignore method can also be exploited to bypass the proxy.
