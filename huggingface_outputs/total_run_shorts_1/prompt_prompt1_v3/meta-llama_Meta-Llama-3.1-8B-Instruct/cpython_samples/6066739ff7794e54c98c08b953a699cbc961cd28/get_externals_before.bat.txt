VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to command injection because it directly uses user input from the environment variable "%IncludeTkinterSrc%" to construct a command. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the value of this variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameter expansion to safely construct the command, and validate the input to prevent malicious commands from being executed. For example, use the following code: if NOT "%IncludeTkinterSrc%"=="false" set "libraries=%libraries% tk-8.6.12.1" && if NOT "%IncludeTkinterSrc%"=="false" set "libraries=%libraries% tix-8.4.3.6". Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input and prevent malicious commands from being executed.  Also, use the `if exist` command with the full path to the library to prevent directory traversal attacks.  For example: `if exist "%EXTERNALS_DIR%\%%e" (... )`.  This will prevent an attacker from manipulating the value of the `libraries` variable to inject malicious commands.  Finally, consider using a
