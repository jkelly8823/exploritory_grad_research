VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to command injection because it uses the `set` command to construct a string that is then used to set the `libraries` variable. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the `libraries` variable. This is particularly concerning because the code is using the `set` command to construct the string, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to construct the string, such as using a loop to iterate over the libraries and append them to the string. Additionally, the code should validate the input to ensure that it only contains valid library names. The `set` command should be avoided whenever possible, and instead, the code should use a more secure method to construct the string. For example, the code could use the `&` operator to concatenate the strings, like this: `set libraries=%libraries% & tk-8.6.12.1`. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious commands. 

Note: The vulnerability is in the `set` command,
