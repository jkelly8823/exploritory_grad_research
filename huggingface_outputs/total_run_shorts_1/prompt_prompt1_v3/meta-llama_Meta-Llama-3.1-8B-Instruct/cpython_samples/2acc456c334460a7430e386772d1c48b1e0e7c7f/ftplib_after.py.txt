VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The getline method is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. This is because it does not properly handle the case where the server sends a line that is larger than the maximum allowed size. In this case, the method will raise an Error exception, but it will not close the connection. This allows an attacker to send a large line and then repeatedly send smaller lines, causing the method to enter an infinite loop.
EXPLANATION: The getline method is designed to read one line from the server and return it. However, it does not properly handle the case where the server sends a line that is larger than the maximum allowed size. When this happens, the method will raise an Error exception, but it will not close the connection. This allows an attacker to send a large line and then repeatedly send smaller
