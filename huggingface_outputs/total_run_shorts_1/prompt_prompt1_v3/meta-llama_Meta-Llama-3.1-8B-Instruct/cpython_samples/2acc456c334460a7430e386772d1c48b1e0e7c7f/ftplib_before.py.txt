 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of error handling in the getline() method. If the server returns an invalid response, the method will enter an infinite loop, consuming system resources and potentially causing the program to crash.
EXPLANATION: The getline() method is designed to read one line from the server, but it does not properly handle the case where the server returns an invalid response. If the server returns a response that is not a single line, the method will enter an infinite loop, repeatedly reading from the file and printing debug messages. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the program consumes all available system resources and becomes unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the getline() method should be modified to properly handle invalid responses from the server. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the response is a single line, and raising an exception if it is not. Additionally, the method should be modified to handle the case where the server returns an empty response, which can also lead to an infinite loop. The modified method should look something like
