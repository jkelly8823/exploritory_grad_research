 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `urllib.request.URLopener` class, which is deprecated and can lead to security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `open_local_file` method is not properly implemented, allowing an attacker to potentially access local files.
EXPLANATION: The `urllib.request.URLopener` class is deprecated and should not be used in new code. The `open_local_file` method is not properly implemented, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. The code is also vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `local_file://` scheme, which is not properly handled by the `urllib` module.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `urllib.request.urlopen` function instead of the `urllib.request.URLopener` class. Additionally, the `open_local_file` method should be properly implemented to reject the `local_file://` scheme. The code should also be updated to handle the `local_file://` scheme properly.
