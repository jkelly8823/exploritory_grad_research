 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the exponential increase in delay time.
EXPLANATION: The line `delay = min(delay * 2, max_delay)` causes the delay time to double with each iteration, which can lead to an exponential increase in delay time. This can cause the program to hang indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more controlled approach to increasing the delay time, such as a linear increase or a bounded exponential increase. For example, you could use `delay = min(delay + 1, max_delay)` to increase the delay time by a fixed amount each iteration. Alternatively, you could use a bounded exponential increase, such as `delay = min(delay * 2, max_delay)` but with a maximum number of iterations to prevent the delay time from growing indefinitely.  ```python
import time

max_delay = 10

def my_function():
    delay = 1
    while True:
        time.sleep(delay)
        delay = min(delay * 2, max_delay)

my_function()
