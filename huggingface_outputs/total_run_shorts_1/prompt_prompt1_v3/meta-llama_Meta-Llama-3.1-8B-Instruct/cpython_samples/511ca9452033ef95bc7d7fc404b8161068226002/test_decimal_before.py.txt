VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential vulnerability due to the use of a mutable default argument in the class definition. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the class is instantiated multiple times.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `decimal` attribute in the `PyUsabilityTest` and `PyCoverage` classes is assigned a mutable object (`P`). When the class is instantiated multiple times, the same mutable object is referenced, leading to unexpected behavior. This is because default argument values are evaluated only once at the point of function definition in the defining scope. This can lead to issues when the default argument is a mutable object that is modified after the function definition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the default argument value should be replaced with a default value that is not mutable, such as a tuple or a list. Alternatively, the `decimal` attribute can be assigned a new value in the `__init__` method of the class. For example: `def __init__(self, decimal=None): self.decimal = decimal`. This ensures that each instance of the class has its own copy of the `decimal
