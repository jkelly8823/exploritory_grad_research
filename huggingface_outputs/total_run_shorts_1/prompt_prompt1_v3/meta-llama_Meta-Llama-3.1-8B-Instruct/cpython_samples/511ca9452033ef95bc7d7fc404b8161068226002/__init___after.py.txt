 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger system that manages the integer string conversion length limit. It includes a context manager that temporarily adjusts the limit and a function that adjusts the delay value. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code is secure as is.

Here is the segment you will be evaluating:


        if not isinstance(delay, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("delay must be a number")
        if delay < 0:
            raise ValueError("delay must be non-negative")
        if delay > max_delay:
            raise ValueError("delay must not exceed max_delay")
        time.sleep(delay)
        delay = min(delay * 2, max_delay)


@contextlib.contextmanager
def adjust_int_max_str_digits(max_digits):
    """Temporarily change the integer string conversion length limit."""
    current = sys.get_int_max_str_digits()
    try:
        sys.set_int_max_str_digits(max_digits)
        yield
    finally:
        sys.set_int_max_str_digits(current)

This concludes your task.
