VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of sys.hash_info.modulus in a comparison. This can lead to an infinite loop if the modulus is very large.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the line where sys.hash_info.modulus is compared to 2**sys.hash_info.width. If sys.hash_info.modulus is very large, this comparison will always be true, causing the assertLess function to fail and potentially leading to an infinite loop.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the comparison should be changed to a more robust check, such as checking if sys.hash_info.modulus is less than 2**sys.hash_info.width - 1. This will prevent the potential DoS attack. Additionally, it's a good practice to add a check for potential overflow when working with large numbers.
