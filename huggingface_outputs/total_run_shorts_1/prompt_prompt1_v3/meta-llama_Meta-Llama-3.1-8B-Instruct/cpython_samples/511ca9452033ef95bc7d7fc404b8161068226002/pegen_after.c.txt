VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the size of the object being added to the arena.
EXPLANATION: The _PyArena_AddPyObject function does not perform any bounds checking on the size of the object being added, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the object is larger than the available space in the arena. This could result in undefined behavior, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the _PyArena_AddPyObject function should be modified to perform bounds checking on the size of the object being added. This can be done by checking the size of the object against the available space in the arena before attempting to add it. If the object is too large, an error should be raised to prevent the buffer overflow. Additionally, consider using a more robust memory management system, such as a memory pool, to reduce the risk of buffer overflows.  ```c
#include <Python.h>
#include "pycore_ast.h"           // _PyAST_Validate(),
#include "pycore_pystate.h"       // _PyThreadState_GET()
