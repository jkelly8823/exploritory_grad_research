VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer in the flags_desc struct.
EXPLANATION: The flags_desc struct has a fixed size of 17, but the number of fields in the flags_fields array is not guaranteed to be less than or equal to 17. If the number of fields exceeds 17, a buffer overflow will occur when the struct is initialized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the flags_desc struct should be dynamically allocated based on the number of fields in the flags_fields array. Alternatively, the flags_fields array should be limited to a maximum size of 17 to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the flags_desc struct is not used in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow.
