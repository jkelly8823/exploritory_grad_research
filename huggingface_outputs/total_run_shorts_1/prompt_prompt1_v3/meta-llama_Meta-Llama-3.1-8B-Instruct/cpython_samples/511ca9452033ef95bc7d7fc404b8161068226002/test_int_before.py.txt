VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. The base 32 number '1_2_3_4_5_6_7' is converted to an integer, which is then compared to an expected value. However, the conversion of the base 32 number to an integer can result in an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect comparison.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the int() function to convert a base 32 number to an integer. However, the base 32 number '1_2_3_4_5_6_7' is too large to be represented by an integer in Python. When the int() function attempts to convert this number, it will result in an integer overflow, causing the function to return an incorrect value. This can lead to a false negative result in the assertion.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a library that can handle large numbers, such as the gmpy2 library. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a different base for the number, such as base 10. The code should also be modified to handle the case where the
