 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a struct definition for a types_state and a callable_cache. The fields are exposed through PyInterpreterState pointer fields, but they are not directly accessible outside of the init function.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The struct definitions are straightforward and do not contain any potential security risks. The comment suggests that the fields are exposed through PyInterpreterState pointer fields, but this is not a vulnerability in itself. It is simply a design choice to avoid allocation during init.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a safe and secure implementation.  ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
