VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential code injection attack due to the use of the eval() function. The eval() function can evaluate any Python expression, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The eval() function is used to evaluate the string "0o777" and "-0o0000010". This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code. For example, an attacker could pass a string like "os.system('rm -rf /')" to the eval() function, which would execute the command and potentially delete files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The eval() function should be avoided whenever possible. Instead, use the int() function to convert the string to an integer. For example, int("0o777", 0) would convert the string to an integer in octal base. Additionally, the use of eval() should be thoroughly reviewed and sanitized to prevent any potential code injection attacks. The code should be modified to use a safer alternative, such as int() or a custom function that properly sanitizes the input.
