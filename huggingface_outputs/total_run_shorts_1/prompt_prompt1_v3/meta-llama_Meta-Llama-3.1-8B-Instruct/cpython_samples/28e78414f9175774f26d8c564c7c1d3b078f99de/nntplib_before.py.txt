 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of the `readline()` method without proper sanitization of the input.
EXPLANATION: The `readline()` method reads a line from the file object, but it does not perform any validation on the input. This means that if the input contains malicious code, it could be executed, potentially leading to a SQL injection attack. The `strip_crlf` variable is not properly sanitized, which makes it vulnerable to injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `readline()` method should be replaced with a safer method, such as `readline().strip()` or `readline().replace('\r\n', '')`. Additionally, the `strip_crlf` variable should be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks. This can be done by using a library like `sqlparse` to parse the input and remove any malicious code. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is not SQL injection, but rather a potential command injection attack due to the use of the `readline()` method without proper sanitization of the input. The `strip_crlf` variable is not
