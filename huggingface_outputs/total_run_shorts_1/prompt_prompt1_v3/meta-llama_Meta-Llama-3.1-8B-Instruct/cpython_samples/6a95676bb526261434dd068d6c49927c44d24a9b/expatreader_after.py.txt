 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the lack of proper handling of the file object returned by source.getCharacterStream(). If an exception occurs during the execution of the _close_source method, the file object will not be closed, leading to a resource leak.
EXPLANATION: The _close_source method is intended to close the source object, but it does not properly handle the file object returned by source.getCharacterStream(). If an exception occurs during the execution of the _close_source method, the file object will not be closed, leading to a resource leak. This can cause issues such as file descriptor leaks, memory leaks, and other resource-related problems.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the file object should be closed in a finally block to ensure that it is closed regardless of whether an exception occurs. The corrected code should look like this:
```
def _close_source(self):
    source = self._source
    try:
        file = source.getCharacterStream()
        #... (rest of the code remains the same)
    finally:
        file.close()
```            # FIXME: when to invoke error()?
