VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (MAX_CHUNK_SIZE) without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The MAX_CHUNK_SIZE constant is defined as 1 << 20, which is a fixed-size buffer. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking on the buffer size, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. An attacker could potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large XML document, leading to undefined behavior and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform bounds checking on the buffer size before allocating memory for the buffer. This can be achieved by using a dynamic buffer size or by using a library that provides bounds checking for buffer operations. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer alternative to fixed-size buffers, such as using a vector or a dynamic array. The code should also consider using a library that provides protection against buffer overflow attacks, such as AddressSanitizer or Valgrind.  VULNERABLE: YES
