 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the lack of a finally block to close the file object in the event of an exception.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to close a file object in the _close_source method, but it does not handle the case where an exception occurs while trying to close the file. This can lead to a resource leak if an exception is thrown after the file object is obtained but before it is closed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a try/finally block to ensure that the file object is closed regardless of whether an exception occurs. For example: 
try:
    file = source.getCharacterStream()
except Exception as e:
    # handle the exception
    pass
finally:
    if file is not None:
        file.close() 
```
