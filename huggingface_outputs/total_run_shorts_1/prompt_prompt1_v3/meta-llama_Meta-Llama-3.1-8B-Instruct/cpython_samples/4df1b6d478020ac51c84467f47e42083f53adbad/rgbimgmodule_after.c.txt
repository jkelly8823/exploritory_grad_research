VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a calculated value (rlebuflen) that is not checked for overflow before being used as an array size.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a calculated value (rlebuflen) to determine the size of an array, but does not check if this value is within the valid range for the array size. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the calculated value is larger than the maximum allowed array size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the calculated value (rlebuflen) is within the valid range for the array size before using it. This can be done by checking if the value is less than or equal to the maximum allowed array size. Additionally, consider using a safer method to calculate the array size, such as using a fixed value or a value that is calculated based on a known maximum size.  The code should also consider using a safer method to handle the buffer, such as using a buffer that is large enough to hold the maximum possible data.  The code should also consider using a safer method to handle the buffer
