VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cookie injection attack. This is because the `cookies.SimpleCookie().load()` method does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary cookies.
EXPLANATION: The `cookies.SimpleCookie().load()` method is used to parse a string into a dictionary of cookie values. However, this method does not perform any validation on the input string, making it vulnerable to cookie injection attacks. An attacker could inject arbitrary cookies by crafting a malicious input string that is parsed by the `load()` method.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to parse the cookie string, such as using a library that properly sanitizes user input. One possible solution is to use the `http.cookies.SimpleCookie()` constructor with the `unescape()` method to properly unescape the cookie string before parsing it. For example: `C = http.cookies.SimpleCookie(unescape(data))`. Additionally, the code should validate the input string to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This can be done by using a regular expression to match the input string against a known format. For example: `if not
