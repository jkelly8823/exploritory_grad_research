VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string concatenation with user input. The `str.translate(_Translator)` expression is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious input.
EXPLANATION: The `str.translate(_Translator)` expression is used to translate special characters in the input string. However, the `_Translator` object is not properly initialized or validated, making it susceptible to manipulation by an attacker. This can lead to a SQL injection attack if the translated string is used in a database query.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `_Translator` object should be properly initialized and validated to ensure that it only translates legitimate special characters. Additionally, the use of string concatenation should be avoided in favor of parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should be refactored to use a safer method of string manipulation, such as using a library like `sqlalchemy` or `psycopg2` that provides parameterized queries. The `_unquote` function should also be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles special characters and does not introduce any new vulnerabilities.  The `_get
