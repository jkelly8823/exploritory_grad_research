VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cookie tampering attack. An attacker could modify the cookie value and the version number, and the test would still pass.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the fact that the test_load method is only checking if the cookie value and version number match the expected values, but it does not verify the integrity of the cookie. An attacker could modify the cookie value and version number, and the test would still pass. This is a classic example of a cookie tampering attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the test_load method should be modified to verify the integrity of the cookie. This can be done by checking the cookie's signature or using a secure cookie library that provides integrity checks. Additionally, the test should be updated to check for any unexpected cookie attributes. For example, the test could check if the cookie has any unexpected attributes, such as a'secure' or 'httponly' attribute. This would help to prevent an attacker from modifying the cookie and making it appear as if it was set by the server.
