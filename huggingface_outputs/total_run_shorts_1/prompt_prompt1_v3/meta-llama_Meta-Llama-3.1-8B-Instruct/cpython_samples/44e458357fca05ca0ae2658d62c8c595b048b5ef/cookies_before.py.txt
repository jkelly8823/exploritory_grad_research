VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string concatenation with user input. The `_unquote` function does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The `_unquote` function is designed to unquote special characters in a string, but it does not properly handle user input. The `str.translate(_Translator)` expression is used to translate special characters, but it does not check if the input is safe to use in a SQL query. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by providing a specially crafted input string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `_unquote` function should be modified to properly sanitize the input using a whitelist approach. This can be achieved by using a library like `sqlparse` to parse the input string and remove any malicious SQL code. Additionally, the `str.translate(_Translator)` expression should be replaced with a safer method of translating special characters, such as using a library like `unicode-escape`. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.  V
