VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a proxy bypass attack. The proxy_bypass_environment function is being used to bypass proxy settings for specific domains. However, the function is being used in a way that allows an attacker to bypass proxy settings for any domain by specifying a port number in the domain name.
EXPLANATION: The proxy_bypass_environment function is designed to bypass proxy settings for specific domains. However, by specifying a port number in the domain name, an attacker can bypass proxy settings for any domain. This is because the function does not properly handle port numbers in the domain name. For example, if an attacker specifies a domain name like "example.com:80", the function will bypass proxy settings for the entire domain, not just the specific port.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the proxy_bypass_environment function should be modified to properly handle port numbers in the domain name. This can be done by splitting the domain name at the colon character and only bypassing proxy settings for the specific port if it is specified. Alternatively, the function can be modified to only allow bypassing proxy settings for specific ports, rather than allowing any port
