VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential proxy bypass attack. This is because it does not properly handle the case where the 'http_proxy' environment variable is set to a non-standard value, such as a value that includes a port number.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the 'http_proxy' environment variable is set and if it is, it removes it from the proxies dictionary. However, it does not check if the value is a standard proxy URL. This means that if an attacker sets the 'http_proxy' environment variable to a non-standard value, such as 'http://example.com:8080', it will be removed from the proxies dictionary, but the non-standard value will still be used. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass proxy settings and make requests directly to the target server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle non-standard proxy URLs. This could be done by using a library such as urllib.parse to parse the proxy URL and check if it is valid. If the proxy URL is not valid, it should be removed from the proxies dictionary. Additionally, the code should be
