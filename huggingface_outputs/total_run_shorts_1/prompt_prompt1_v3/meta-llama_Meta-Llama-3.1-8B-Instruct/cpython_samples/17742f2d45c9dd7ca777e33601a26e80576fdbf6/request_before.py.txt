VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential proxy bypass attack. This is because it does not properly validate the proxy names before adding them to the proxies dictionary. An attacker could potentially add a malicious proxy to the dictionary by manipulating the environment variables.
EXPLANATION: The code is iterating over the environment variables and adding any proxy variables to the proxies dictionary. However, it does not check if the proxy name is valid before adding it. This could allow an attacker to add a malicious proxy to the dictionary by manipulating the environment variables. For example, if the environment variable 'HTTP_PROXY_MALICIOUS' is set, it would be added to the proxies dictionary without any validation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the proxy names before adding them to the proxies dictionary. This could be done by checking if the proxy name is in a list of known valid proxy names. Additionally, the code should also check if the proxy value is valid before adding it to the dictionary. This could be done by checking if the proxy value is a valid URL. The code should also consider using a more secure way to store and retrieve proxy settings
