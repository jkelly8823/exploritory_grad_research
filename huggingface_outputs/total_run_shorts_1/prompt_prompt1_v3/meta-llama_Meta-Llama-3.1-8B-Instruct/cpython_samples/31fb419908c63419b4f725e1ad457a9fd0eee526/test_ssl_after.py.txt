 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to the lack of validation of the server hostname in the ssl.match_hostname function. This function does not properly handle wildcards in the server hostname, which can lead to a denial of service attack.
EXPLANATION: The ssl.match_hostname function is used to validate the server hostname against the certificate subject. However, this function does not properly handle wildcards in the server hostname, which can lead to a denial of service attack. In the provided code, the function is called with a wildcard in the server hostname, which will cause the function to raise a CertificateError. However, the error message does not provide any information about the cause of the error, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the ssl.match_hostname function should be modified to properly handle wildcards in the server hostname. This can be done by adding additional validation to the function to check for wildcards in the server hostname and raising a more informative error message if a wildcard is found. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle server sockets properly, as the provided code demonstrates. This
