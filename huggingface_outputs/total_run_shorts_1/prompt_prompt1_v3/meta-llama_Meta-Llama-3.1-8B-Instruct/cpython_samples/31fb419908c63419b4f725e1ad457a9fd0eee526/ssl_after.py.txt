VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a function that converts a DNS name to a pattern. It checks for the number of wildcards in each fragment of the DNS name and raises an error if it exceeds a certain limit. The code seems to be well-structured and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were found.  The code appears to be secure.  However, it would be beneficial to add input validation to ensure that the input DNS name is not empty or null.  This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function.  Additionally, it would be a good practice to handle the CertificateError exception that is raised when the number of wildcards exceeds the limit.  This can be done by adding a try-except block to handle the exception and provide a meaningful error message to the user.  However, these are just suggestions and do not affect the security of the code.  The code is secure as it is.  It is always a good practice to follow best practices and handle
