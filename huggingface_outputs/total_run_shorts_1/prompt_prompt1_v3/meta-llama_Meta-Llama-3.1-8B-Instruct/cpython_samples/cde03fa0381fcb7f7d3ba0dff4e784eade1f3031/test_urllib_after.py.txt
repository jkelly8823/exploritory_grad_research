 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to proxy bypass attacks. This is because the proxy_bypass_environment function is being used to bypass proxy settings for certain domains, but the function is not properly configured to handle cases where the domain has a port number.
EXPLANATION: The proxy_bypass_environment function is used to bypass proxy settings for certain domains. However, in this code, the function is being used to bypass proxy settings for domains with port numbers (e.g. anotherdomain.com:8888, newdomain.com:1234). This can allow an attacker to bypass proxy settings and make requests to internal domains. To fix this vulnerability, the proxy_bypass_environment function should be modified to properly handle cases where the domain has a port number.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The proxy_bypass_environment function should be modified to properly handle cases where the domain has a port number. This can be done by splitting the domain and port number, and then checking if the domain is in the bypass list. If the domain is in the bypass list, then the proxy bypass should be allowed. If the domain is not in the bypass list, then the proxy bypass should be denied. Additionally,
