 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a configuration file for a build process, and it does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet defines a set of directory paths and library references for a build process. It uses a mix of environment variables and hardcoded paths. The use of environment variables is a good practice, as it allows for flexibility and customization. However, the hardcoded paths may pose a risk if they are not properly validated or sanitized. Nevertheless, in the context of this code snippet, the hardcoded paths are likely intended to be specific to the build process and do not appear to be vulnerable to common web application vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet appears to be secure in its current form. However, it is always a good practice to validate and sanitize any user-input or environment variables to prevent potential security issues. Additionally, consider using more modern and secure ways to manage dependencies and library references, such as using a package manager or a dependency injection framework.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger build process, and the security of the overall system depends on the security of the entire process.
