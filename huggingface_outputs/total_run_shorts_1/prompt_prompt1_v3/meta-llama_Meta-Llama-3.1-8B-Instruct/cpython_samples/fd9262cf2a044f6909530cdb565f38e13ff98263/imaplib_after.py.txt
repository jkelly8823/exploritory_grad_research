VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the readline function. This is because the readline function does not check if the line is longer than _MAXLINE before calling readline() on the file object. This could potentially allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The readline function is designed to prevent reading arbitrary length lines by checking if the line is longer than _MAXLINE. However, it does not check if the line is longer than _MAXLINE before calling readline() on the file object. This means that if the file object returns a line longer than _MAXLINE, the readline function will still call readline() on the file object, potentially overflowing the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the readline function should be modified to check if the line is longer than _MAXLINE before calling readline() on the file object. This can be done by adding a check before calling readline() to ensure that the line is not longer than _MAXLINE. For example: if len(line) <= _MAXLINE: line = self.file.readline(_MAXLINE + 1) else: raise self.error("got more than
