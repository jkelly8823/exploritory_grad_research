 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential privilege escalation attack due to the use of the 'perUser' InstallScope in the Package element. This allows the installer to install the product for the current user, potentially allowing an attacker to elevate privileges.
EXPLANATION: The 'perUser' InstallScope allows the installer to install the product for the current user, which can be exploited by an attacker to elevate privileges. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to install software that can potentially modify system settings or access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, change the InstallScope to 'perMachine' to ensure that the product is installed for all users on the system, rather than just the current user. This will prevent an attacker from exploiting the vulnerability to elevate privileges. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as code signing and secure deployment practices, to further mitigate the risk.  Change the Package element to the following: <Package InstallerVersion="500" Compressed="yes" InstallScope="perMachine" />.  Also, ensure that the code is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential code injection attacks.  Consider
