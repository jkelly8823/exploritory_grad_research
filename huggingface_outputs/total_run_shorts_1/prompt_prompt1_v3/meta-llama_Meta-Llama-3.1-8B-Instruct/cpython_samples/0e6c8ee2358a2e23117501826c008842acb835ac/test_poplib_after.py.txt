VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of input validation in the apop method. An attacker can provide a very long welcome message, causing the apop method to take a significant amount of time to execute.
EXPLANATION: The apop method does not validate the length of the welcome message, allowing an attacker to provide a very long message that can cause the method to take a significant amount of time to execute. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The apop method should be modified to validate the length of the welcome message and prevent an attacker from providing a very long message. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the length of the welcome message is within a reasonable limit. Additionally, the method should be designed to handle unexpected input in a way that prevents a denial-of-service attack. This can be done by using a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may be raised when processing the welcome message.  The welcome message should also be validated to ensure it is a valid string.  The apop method should also be designed to handle the case
