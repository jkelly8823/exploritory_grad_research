VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code. The `size_remaining` variable is not checked for negative values, which could lead to an infinite loop if `max_chunk_size` is set to a value that is less than or equal to 0.
EXPLANATION: The code reads data from the file in chunks, appending each chunk to the list `L`. However, it does not check if `size_remaining` is negative before subtracting `len(L[-1])` from it. If `max_chunk_size` is set to a value that is less than or equal to 0, `size_remaining` will become negative, causing the loop to run indefinitely. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the data being read is large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that `size_remaining` is not negative before subtracting `len(L[-1])` from it. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if `size_remaining` is greater than or equal to 0 before the subtraction. For example: `if size_remaining >= 0: size_remaining -= len
