VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocol downgrade attacks due to the use of SSL_OP_ALL and SSL_CTX_set_verify(SSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL).
EXPLANATION: The use of SSL_OP_ALL enables all SSL/TLS protocol versions, including SSLv2 and SSLv3, which are known to be vulnerable to various attacks. Additionally, setting SSL_CTX_set_verify to SSL_VERIFY_NONE disables certificate verification, making it possible for an attacker to intercept and modify encrypted data. This combination of settings makes the code vulnerable to SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocol downgrade attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the SSL_OP_ALL option and set SSL_CTX_set_verify to a more secure value, such as SSL_VERIFY_PEER. Also, consider setting SSL_CTX_set_options to a more secure value, such as SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 | SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3. Additionally, ensure that certificate verification is enabled and properly configured. This will prevent an attacker from intercepting and modifying encrypted data.  ```python
    self->ctx = ctx;
    /* Defaults */
    SSL_CTX_set_verify(self->ctx,
