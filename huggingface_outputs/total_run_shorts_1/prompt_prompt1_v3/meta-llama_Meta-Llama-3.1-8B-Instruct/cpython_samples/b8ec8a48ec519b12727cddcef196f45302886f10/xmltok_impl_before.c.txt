VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a pointer (ptr) that is not checked for null before being dereferenced in the switch statement.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a pointer (ptr) that is not checked for null before being dereferenced in the switch statement. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the pointer is null. Additionally, the use of a switch statement with a pointer that is not checked for null can lead to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Check the pointer (ptr) for null before dereferencing it in the switch statement.
2. Use a safer approach to handle the pointer, such as using a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when dereferencing the pointer.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a vector or an array, to store the data instead of using a pointer. This can help prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. 4. Use a static analyzer or a code review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. 5. Consider using a safer language, such as Rust, that has built-in support
