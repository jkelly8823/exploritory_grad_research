VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of bounds checking on the 'ptr' variable.
EXPLANATION: The 'ptr' variable is incremented by 'n' in each case of the switch statement without checking if it exceeds the 'end' pointer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the 'ptr' variable is incremented beyond the 'end' pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that 'ptr' does not exceed 'end' before incrementing it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if 'ptr + n' is less than or equal to 'end' before incrementing 'ptr'. For example: if (ptr + n <= end) ptr += n; else break;. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability.  ```c
#define LEAD_CASE(n) \
    case BT_LEAD ## n: \
      if (ptr + n <= end) ptr += n; else break; \
```  ```c
#define LEAD_CASE(n) \
    case BT_LEAD ## n: \
      ptr += n; \
```  ```c
#define LEAD
