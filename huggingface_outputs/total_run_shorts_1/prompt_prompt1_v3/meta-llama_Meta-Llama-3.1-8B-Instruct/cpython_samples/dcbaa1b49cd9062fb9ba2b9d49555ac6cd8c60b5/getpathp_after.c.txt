VULNERABLE_LINES: 34
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `change_ext` function. The `wcsncpy_s` function is used to copy the source string to the destination string, but the length of the source string is not checked correctly. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The `wcsncpy_s` function is used to copy the source string to the destination string. However, the length of the source string is not checked correctly. The `wcsnlen_s` function is used to get the length of the source string, but it returns the length of the string without the null terminator. Therefore, if the source string is longer than the destination buffer, a buffer overflow can occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the length of the source string should be checked correctly before calling the `wcsncpy_s` function. The correct length should be the minimum of the length of the source string and the length of the destination buffer minus one. The code should be modified to use the correct length when calling the `wcsncpy_s` function. Additionally, the `wcsncpy_s
