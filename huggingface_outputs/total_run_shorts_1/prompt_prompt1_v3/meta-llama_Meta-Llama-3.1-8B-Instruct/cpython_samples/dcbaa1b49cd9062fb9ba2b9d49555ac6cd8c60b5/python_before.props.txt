 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a build script or configuration file, likely for a Python extension. It defines the name of the resulting DLL and the version and platform tag to include in.pyd filenames. However, there are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses conditional statements to determine the value of the PydTag based on the architecture. This is a common and safe practice. The use of variables such as MajorVersionNumber, MinorVersionNumber, and PyDebugExt suggests that these values are defined elsewhere in the build script or configuration file. There are no obvious security risks or vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. This code snippet appears to be secure and does not require any changes to fix potential vulnerabilities.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger build script or configuration file, and any potential vulnerabilities may be present in other parts of the code.  It is always a good practice to review the entire codebase for potential security risks.  However, based on this snippet alone, there are no apparent vulnerabilities.  If you are concerned about
