VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `PreprocessorDefinitions` property with user input from the `$(Platform)` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `PreprocessorDefinitions` property is used to define preprocessor macros that are used during compilation. However, in this case, the value of `$(Platform)` is used to construct the definition without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code by manipulating the value of `$(Platform)`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input from `$(Platform)` before using it to construct the preprocessor definition. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed values for `$(Platform)` or by using a secure method to construct the definition. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to define preprocessor macros, such as using a separate file or a secure macro definition mechanism.  ```c
#define PLATFORM_SAFE_VALUE "x64"
#define PLATFORM_SAFE_VALUE "x86"
//...
#define PLATFORM_SAFE_VALUE "arm64"
```  Then, use the safe values in the `PreprocessorDefinitions
