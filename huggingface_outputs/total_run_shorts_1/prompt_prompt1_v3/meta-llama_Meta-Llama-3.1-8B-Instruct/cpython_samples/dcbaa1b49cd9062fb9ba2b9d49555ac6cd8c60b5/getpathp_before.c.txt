VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the change_ext function. This is because the wcsncpy_s function is used without checking the length of the destination buffer, and the wcscat_s function is used without checking the length of the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The change_ext function is used to change the extension of a file path. However, it does not properly check the length of the destination buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This is because the wcsncpy_s function is used without checking the length of the destination buffer, and the wcscat_s function is used without checking the length of the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the destination buffer before calling the wcsncpy_s and wcscat_s functions. This can be done by checking the length of the destination buffer and returning an error if it is too small. Additionally, the code should use the wcsncpy_s function with the correct length parameter to prevent buffer overflows. The correct length parameter should be the minimum of
