VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential SQL injection vulnerability due to the use of string formatting to construct a command string. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The `send` method takes a string `data` as input and sends it to the remote server. However, the `readline` method is called without any validation or sanitization of the input data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by crafting a specially formatted string that is executed by the `readline` method. This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `readline` method should be modified to validate and sanitize the input data before executing it. This can be done by using a library such as `sqlparse` to parse the input data and ensure it conforms to a valid SQL syntax. Additionally, the `send` method should be modified to prevent the injection of malicious SQL code by using parameterized queries or prepared statements. For example, the `send` method could be modified to use a parameterized query like `self.file.readline().format(data)` instead
