VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of BIO_gets() function which does not check the length of the buffer before copying data into it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data is greater than the size of the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_gets() function is used to read data from a BIO (Basic I/O) object into a buffer. However, it does not check the length of the buffer before copying data into it. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data is greater than the size of the buffer. In this code snippet, the BIO_gets() function is used to read data from the biobuf object into the buf buffer. If the length of the data is greater than the size of the buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can use the BIO_read() function instead of BIO_gets(). The BIO_read() function reads data from a BIO object into a buffer and returns the number of bytes read, which can be used to prevent buffer overflows. Alternatively, you can use a
