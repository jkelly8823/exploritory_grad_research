 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential certificate validation issue due to the use of a non-existent certificate file ("XXXnonexisting.pem") and a potentially malicious certificate file ("badkey.pem").
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to load certificates from files, but one of the files ("XXXnonexisting.pem") does not exist, which could lead to a certificate validation error. Additionally, the code loads a certificate from a file named "badkey.pem", which could potentially be a malicious certificate. This could allow an attacker to intercept or tamper with encrypted communications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Ensure that the certificate files exist and are valid before attempting to load them. Verify the authenticity of the certificates by checking their signatures or using a trusted certificate authority. Consider using a secure method to load certificates, such as using a certificate store or a secure protocol like HTTPS. Additionally, consider implementing certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  Also, consider using a secure way to handle the certificate files, such as using a secure file system or a secure way to read the files.  Consider using a library that can handle certificate validation for you, such as cryptography or py
