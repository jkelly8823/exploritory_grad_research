VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a null byte vulnerability in the subjectAltName field of an SSL certificate. This is a known vulnerability, CVE-2013-4073.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it does not properly handle null bytes in the subjectAltName field of an SSL certificate. This can lead to a buffer overflow and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is present in the test_parse_cert_CVE_2013_4073 function, where the subjectAltName field contains a null byte.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle null bytes in the subjectAltName field. This can be done by using a library that is designed to handle SSL certificates, such as OpenSSL. Additionally, the code should be updated to check for null bytes in the subjectAltName field before attempting to parse the certificate. This can be done by using a regular expression to check for null bytes in the subjectAltName field.
