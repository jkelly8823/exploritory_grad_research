VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a simple header file that defines version numbers for an XML parser. The version numbers are defined as macros, and the code includes a comment referencing the semver.org specification for versioning. The code also includes a conditional compilation directive to close a block of code if the compiler is C++.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a straightforward and innocuous header file. However, it is worth noting that the use of macros for version numbers may not be the most modern or flexible approach, and alternative methods such as using a version control system or a separate version file may be more suitable for larger projects. Nevertheless, this code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
