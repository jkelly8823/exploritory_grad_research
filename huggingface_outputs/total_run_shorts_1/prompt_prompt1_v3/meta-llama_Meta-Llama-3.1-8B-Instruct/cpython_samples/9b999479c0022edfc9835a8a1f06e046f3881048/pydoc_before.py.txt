VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of the `html.escape()` function, which is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks. The `html.escape()` function only escapes special characters, but does not remove them, which can still allow an attacker to inject malicious code.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `html.escape()` function to escape special characters in the file listing. However, this function only escapes special characters, but does not remove them. This means that an attacker can still inject malicious code by including special characters in the file path. For example, an attacker could inject a script tag by including `</script>` in the file path. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to prevent XSS attacks, such as using a library like `bleach` or `html5lib` that can remove special characters and prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, the code should validate user input to prevent malicious code from being injected. The `html.escape()` function should be replaced with a more secure
