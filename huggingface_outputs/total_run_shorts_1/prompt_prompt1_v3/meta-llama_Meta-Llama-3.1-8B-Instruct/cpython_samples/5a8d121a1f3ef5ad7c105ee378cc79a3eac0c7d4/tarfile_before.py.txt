VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The value of `length` is taken directly from the match object, which could be manipulated by an attacker to overflow the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `match.groups()` method to extract the length and keyword from the match object. However, the `length` variable is not validated or sanitized, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate the match object to return a large value for `length`, causing a buffer overflow when trying to access `buf[match.end(2) + 1:match.start(1) + length - 1]`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `length` variable before using it to access the buffer. This could be done by checking if the value is within a reasonable range, or by using a library that provides safe string manipulation functions. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer way to access the buffer, such as using a library that provides bounds checking.  The code should also consider using a safer way to handle the match object, such as using a library that provides secure parsing of regular
