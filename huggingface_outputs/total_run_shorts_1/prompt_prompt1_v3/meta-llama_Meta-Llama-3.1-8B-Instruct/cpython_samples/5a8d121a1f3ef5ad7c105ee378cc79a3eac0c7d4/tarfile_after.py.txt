VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not handle the case where the encoding is not supported by the Python interpreter. This could lead to a UnicodeDecodeError when trying to decode the value.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the'strict' error handler when decoding the value, which means that it will raise a UnicodeDecodeError if the encoding is not supported. However, the code does not check if the encoding is supported before trying to decode the value. This could lead to a UnicodeDecodeError if the encoding is not supported.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should check if the encoding is supported before trying to decode the value. You can use the 'errors' parameter of the decode method to specify an error handler that will replace any unsupported characters with a replacement marker. For example, you can use the'replace' error handler to replace any unsupported characters with a replacement marker. Alternatively, you can use the 'ignore' error handler to ignore any unsupported characters. However, using the 'ignore' error handler may lead to data loss if the encoding is not supported.  You can also use the chardet library to detect the encoding of the value and
