VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability due to the use of `to_model` method which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The `to_model` method is used to convert an object to its corresponding model. However, if the object is not a model, it can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a potential SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Validate the input to ensure it is a model before calling `to_model` method.
2. Use a whitelist approach to ensure only expected models are allowed.
3. Consider using a more secure method to convert objects to models, such as using a mapping or a factory method. 
4. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks. 
5. Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract away the underlying database and reduce the risk of SQL injection. 6. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 8. Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities. 9. Always follow secure coding practices and guidelines
