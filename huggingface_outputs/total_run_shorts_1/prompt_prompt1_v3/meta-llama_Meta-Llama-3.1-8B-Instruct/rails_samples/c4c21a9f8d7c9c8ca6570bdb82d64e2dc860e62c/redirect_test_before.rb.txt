VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a JavaScript injection attack. The `redirect_to` method is being used with a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload.
EXPLANATION: The `redirect_to` method is being used with a URL that includes a JavaScript payload, specifically the `eval(name)` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to a JavaScript injection attack. The `ActionController::Parameters.new` method is used to create a new parameters object, but it does not sanitize the input, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `redirect_to` method should be used with a sanitized URL. The `ActionController::Parameters.new` method should be used with a trusted source of data, or the input should be sanitized before being passed to this method. Additionally, the `eval` function should be avoided whenever possible, as it can pose a security risk. Instead, consider using a safer alternative, such as `JSON.parse` or a library like `js-yaml`. The `redirect_to` method should be used with a URL that is trusted and sanitized, and the `ActionController
