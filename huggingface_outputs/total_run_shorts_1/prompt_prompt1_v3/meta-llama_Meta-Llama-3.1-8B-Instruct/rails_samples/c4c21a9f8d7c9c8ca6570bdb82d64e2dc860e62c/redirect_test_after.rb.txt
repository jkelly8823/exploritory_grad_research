VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of user-controlled input in the redirect URL.
EXPLANATION: The `redirect_to_params` method is vulnerable because it uses the `ActionController::Parameters.new` method to create a hash with user-controlled input. The `f` parameter is set to `"%0Aeval(name)"`, which is a malicious string that can be used to inject JavaScript code into the redirect URL. This can lead to a stored XSS attack, where an attacker can inject malicious code into the redirect URL and execute it on the client-side.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid using user-controlled input in the redirect URL. Instead, use a secure method to generate the redirect URL, such as using a parameterized query or a secure URL generator. Additionally, you should validate and sanitize any user input to prevent XSS attacks. In this case, you can replace the `f` parameter with a secure value, such as a random token or a secure hash. For example: `redirect_to ActionController::Parameters.new(status: 200, protocol: "javascript
