VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of `to_model` method which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The `to_model` method is used to convert an object to its corresponding model. However, if an attacker can manipulate the `record` object to point to a malicious model, they can inject SQL code through the `model_name.singular_route_key` method. This can lead to a SQL injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the `record` object to ensure it is a valid model instance before calling `to_model` on it. You can use the `is_a?` method to check if the `record` object is an instance of a model class. Additionally, you should consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
