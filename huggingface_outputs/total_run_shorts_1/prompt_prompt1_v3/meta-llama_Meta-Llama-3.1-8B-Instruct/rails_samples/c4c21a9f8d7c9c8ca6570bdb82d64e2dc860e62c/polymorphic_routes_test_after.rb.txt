VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of unsanitized user input in the polymorphic_url method. This could lead to a potential path traversal attack.
EXPLANATION: The polymorphic_url method is called with unsanitized user input, specifically the @project variable. This variable could potentially contain malicious input that could be used to manipulate the route path. The use of unsanitized user input in this manner could lead to a potential path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the @project variable should be sanitized before being passed to the polymorphic_url method. This could be achieved by using a method such as sanitize_path or strip_tags to remove any malicious input. Additionally, the polymorphic_url method should be updated to handle sanitized input. For example, it could be modified to use a whitelist of allowed characters for the route path. This would help prevent any potential path traversal attacks.  The with_namespaced_routes method should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not passing any unsanitized user input to the polymorphic_url method.  It is also recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to
