VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of the `assert_url` method with an array of strings or symbols that can be manipulated by an attacker.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_url` method is called with an array of strings or symbols that can be manipulated by an attacker. This can lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker can manipulate the URL to access unauthorized resources. The `assert_url` method should be called with a single string or symbol that represents the expected URL, rather than an array of values that can be manipulated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `assert_url` method should be called with a single string or symbol that represents the expected URL. For example, instead of `assert_url "http://example.com/projects", ["projects"]`, use `assert_url "http://example.com/projects"`. Similarly, instead of `assert_url "http://example.com/series/new", [:new, :series]`, use `assert_url "http://example.com/series/new"`. This will prevent an attacker from manipulating the URL to access unauthorized resources. Additionally, consider using a
