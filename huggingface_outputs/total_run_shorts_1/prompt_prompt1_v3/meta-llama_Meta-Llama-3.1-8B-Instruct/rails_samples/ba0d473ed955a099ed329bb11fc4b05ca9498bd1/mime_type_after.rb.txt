 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a complex regular expression with a large number of possible matches.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the MIME_REGEXP variable is complex and can lead to catastrophic backtracking, which can cause the program to consume excessive resources and potentially crash. This is a known vulnerability in regular expressions, particularly when used with user-supplied input.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust regular expression engine, such as the Oniguruma engine, or use a library that provides a safer way to match MIME types. Additionally, consider limiting the number of possible matches by using a more restrictive regular expression or by using a whitelist of allowed MIME types. It's also a good practice to use a regular expression with a possessive quantifier (e.g., `+?>`) to prevent backtracking. Finally, consider using a library that provides a safer way to parse MIME types, such as the `mime-types` gem.  Also, consider using a more secure way to escape the regular expression, such as using a library like `
