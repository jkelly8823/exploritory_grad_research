 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a complex regular expression with a large number of possible matches.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the MIME_REGEXP variable is complex and can lead to catastrophic backtracking, which can cause the program to consume excessive resources and potentially crash. This is a known vulnerability in regular expressions, particularly when used with user-supplied input.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust regular expression engine, such as the one provided by the'rex' gem. Alternatively, you can try to simplify the regular expression by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Additionally, consider using a library that can help prevent ReDoS attacks, such as're2' or'regex'. It's also a good practice to limit the number of possible matches by using possessive quantifiers or atomic grouping. Finally, make sure to properly sanitize any user-supplied input before passing it to the regular expression.  ```ruby
    MIME_NAME = "[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9#{Regexp
