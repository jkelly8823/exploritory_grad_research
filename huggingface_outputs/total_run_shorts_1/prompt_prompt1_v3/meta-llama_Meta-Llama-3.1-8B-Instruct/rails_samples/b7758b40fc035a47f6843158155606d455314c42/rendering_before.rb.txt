VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential code injection attack due to the use of the `is_a?` method to check if the `action` parameter is a hash. This method can be bypassed by an attacker who passes a hash object that is not an instance of the `Hash` class, but rather an instance of a subclass of `Hash`.
EXPLANATION: The `is_a?` method checks if an object is an instance of a particular class or its subclasses. However, in Ruby, it is possible to create a subclass of `Hash` that behaves like a hash but is not an instance of the `Hash` class. An attacker could create such a subclass and pass an instance of it to the `_normalize_args` method, causing the method to incorrectly identify it as a hash and potentially leading to a code injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `respond_to?` method to check if the `action` parameter responds to the `to_hash` method, which is a more reliable way to determine if an object is a hash. Alternatively, the code could use the `Hash ===
