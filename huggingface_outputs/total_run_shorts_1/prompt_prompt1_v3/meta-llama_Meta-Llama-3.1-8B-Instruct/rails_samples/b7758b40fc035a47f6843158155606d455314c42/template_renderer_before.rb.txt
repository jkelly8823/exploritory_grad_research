VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of the `with_fallbacks` method without proper error handling. This could lead to an exception being raised if the fallbacks are not properly configured.
EXPLANATION: The `with_fallbacks` method is used to handle template fallbacks, but it does not provide any error handling. If the fallbacks are not properly configured, an exception could be raised, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add proper error handling to the `with_fallbacks` method. This could involve wrapping the method call in a `begin`/`rescue` block to catch and handle any exceptions that may be raised. For example: `begin; with_fallbacks {... }; rescue Exception => e; # handle the exception end`. Additionally, you should ensure that the fallbacks are properly configured to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities. ```ruby
      elsif options.key?(:html)
        Template::HTML.new(options[:html], formats.first)
      elsif options.key?(:file)
        begin
          with_fallbacks { find_template(options[:file], nil
