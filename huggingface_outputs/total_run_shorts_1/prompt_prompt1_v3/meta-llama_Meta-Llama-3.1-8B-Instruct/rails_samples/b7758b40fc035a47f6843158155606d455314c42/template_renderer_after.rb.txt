 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of the `eval` method in the `Template.handler_for_extension` method. This method is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but it is likely that it uses `eval` to execute the template handler. The use of `eval` can lead to code injection attacks if the template handler is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `Template.handler_for_extension` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is likely that it uses `eval` to execute the template handler. This is a potential vulnerability because `eval` can execute arbitrary Ruby code, which can lead to code injection attacks if the template handler is not properly sanitized. The `with_fallbacks` block is also a potential vulnerability because it uses the `find_file` method, which may not properly sanitize the file path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `Template.handler_for_extension` method should be modified to use a safer method of executing the template handler, such as `eval` with a sandboxed environment or a safer alternative like `binding.eval`. Additionally, the `find_file` method should
