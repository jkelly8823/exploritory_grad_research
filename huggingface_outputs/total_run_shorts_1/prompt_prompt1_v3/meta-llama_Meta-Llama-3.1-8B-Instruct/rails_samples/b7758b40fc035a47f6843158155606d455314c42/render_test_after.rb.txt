VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `render` method is called with a template path that is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially manipulate the path to access arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `render` method is called with a template path that is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path to access arbitrary files on the system. In the `test_render_outside_path` method, the `render` method is called with a path that is constructed by concatenating the current directory and a path that is provided by the attacker. This path is not properly sanitized, allowing the attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `render` method should be called with a sanitized template path. This can be achieved by using the `File.join` method to properly join the path components, and by using the `File.expand_path` method to expand the path to an absolute path. Additionally, the `render` method should be called with a path that is within the application's root directory, to prevent path traversal attacks. For example: `
