VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of `Regexp.escape` on a large number of strings.
EXPLANATION: The `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape special characters in a string so that it can be used in a regular expression. However, if the input string is very large or contains a large number of special characters, the method can take a significant amount of time to execute, potentially leading to a denial of service attack. In this code, the `Regexp.escape` method is called on each extension in the `exts` hash, which can lead to a ReDoS attack if the extensions contain a large number of special characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more efficient method to escape special characters, such as a loop that iterates over the extensions and escapes each one individually. Alternatively, consider using a regular expression that is designed to handle large inputs, such as one that uses a possessive quantifier (`+`) to prevent backtracking. Additionally, consider adding input validation to ensure that the extensions do not contain a
