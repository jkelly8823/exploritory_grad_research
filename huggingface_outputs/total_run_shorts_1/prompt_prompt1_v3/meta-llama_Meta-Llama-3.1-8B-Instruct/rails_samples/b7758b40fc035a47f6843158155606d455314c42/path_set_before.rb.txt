VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the recursive nature of the find_all method. If the input path is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially cause the method to recurse indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.
EXPLANATION: The find_all method is designed to recursively search for templates in the given path. However, if the input path is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially manipulate the path to cause the method to recurse indefinitely. This could lead to a stack overflow, resulting in a denial of service attack. The vulnerability is present in the find_all method, which is called by the exists? method.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the find_all method should be modified to include input validation and sanitization to prevent recursive calls. This could be achieved by checking the input path for any malicious patterns or characters before proceeding with the recursive search. Additionally, the method could be modified to use an iterative approach instead of recursion to prevent stack overflows. The private method typecast could also be modified to include input validation to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.  ```bash
def find_all(path, prefixes
