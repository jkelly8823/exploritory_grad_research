VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `find_template_paths` method uses `Dir[]` to find files matching a glob pattern, and the glob pattern is constructed by concatenating the `@path` and `query` variables. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `query` variable to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `find_template_paths` method uses `Dir[]` to find files matching a glob pattern. The glob pattern is constructed by concatenating the `@path` and `query` variables. If an attacker can manipulate the `query` variable to include directory traversal characters (e.g. `../`), they could potentially access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `find_template_paths` method should be modified to use a more secure method for finding files, such as `File.expand_path` or `Pathname`. Additionally, the `query` variable should be sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks. For example,
