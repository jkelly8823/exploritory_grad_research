VULNERABLE_LINES: 34, 35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `find_template_paths` method uses `Dir[]` to find files matching a glob pattern, and the glob pattern is constructed by concatenating user-provided input (`@pattern.dup`) with a directory path (`File.join(@path, '')`). An attacker could potentially manipulate the glob pattern to traverse outside of the intended directory, leading to unauthorized access to files.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `find_template_paths` method uses `Dir[]` to find files matching a glob pattern. The glob pattern is constructed by concatenating user-provided input (`@pattern.dup`) with a directory path (`File.join(@path, '')`). This allows an attacker to manipulate the glob pattern to traverse outside of the intended directory, leading to unauthorized access to files. The `inside_path?` method is used to filter out files outside of the intended directory, but this method is not foolproof and can be bypassed by an attacker.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to find files, such as
