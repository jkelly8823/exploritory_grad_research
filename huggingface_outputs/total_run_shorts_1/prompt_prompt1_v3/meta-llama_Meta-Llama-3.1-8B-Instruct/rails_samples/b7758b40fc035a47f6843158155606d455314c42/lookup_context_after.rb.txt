VULNERABLE_LINES: 5,6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `find_file` and `find_all` methods do not properly sanitize the `name` parameter, allowing an attacker to potentially traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
EXPLANATION: The `args_for_lookup` method is called with the `name` parameter, but it does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious file paths, leading to a path traversal attack. The `find_file` and `find_all` methods then use the unvalidated input to search for files, which can lead to sensitive files being accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `args_for_lookup` method should be modified to properly sanitize the `name` parameter. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides path sanitization functionality. Additionally, the `find_file` and `find_all` methods should be modified to use the sanitized input when searching for files. This can be done by using the sanitized input as the first argument to the `find_file` or `
