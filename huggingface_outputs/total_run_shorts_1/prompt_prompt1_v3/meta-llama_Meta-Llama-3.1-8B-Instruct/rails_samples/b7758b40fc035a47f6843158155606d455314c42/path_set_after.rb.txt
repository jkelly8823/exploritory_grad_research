VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential path traversal attack. This occurs when the `find_all` and `find_file` methods do not properly sanitize the input `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `find_all` and `find_file` methods do not validate the input `path` parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `path` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory. The `find_all` and `find_file` methods use the `find_all_anywhere` method of the `resolver` object, which does not perform any validation on the `path` parameter. This makes it possible for an attacker to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `find_all` and `find_file` methods should be modified to validate the input `path` parameter. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed directories or by using a library that performs path validation. Additionally, the `find_all_anywhere` method of the `resolver` object should be modified to perform path validation
