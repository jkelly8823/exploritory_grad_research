VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly sanitize user input when rendering a file. This can lead to a potential path traversal vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the `action` parameter is an instance of `ActionController::Parameters` and if it is permitted. However, it does not check if the `action` parameter is a string that contains a path to a file. If an attacker can manipulate the `action` parameter to contain a path to a file, they may be able to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the `action` parameter is a string and if it contains a path to a file. If it does, the code should raise an error or sanitize the path to prevent path traversal. The code should also consider using a whitelist approach to validate the file path. For example, it could only allow file paths that start with a specific directory. Additionally, the code should consider using a library like `rails-secure` to help prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.  The code should also consider using the `ActionController::Parameters#permit` method to sanitize the
