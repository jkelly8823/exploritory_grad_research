VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of `Regexp.escape` on a string that is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape special characters in a string so that it can be used in a regular expression. However, if the input string is not properly sanitized, it can lead to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability, also known as a ReDoS attack. In this code, the `exts[ext].map` block is iterating over an array of file extensions, and the `Regexp.escape` method is being called on each extension. However, if an attacker can manipulate the `exts` hash to include a malicious extension, it can lead to a ReDoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer method to construct the regular expression, such as using a library like `rubocop` to validate the input, or using a more robust regular expression construction method. Additionally, you should ensure that the `exts` hash is properly sanitized and validated before using it to construct
