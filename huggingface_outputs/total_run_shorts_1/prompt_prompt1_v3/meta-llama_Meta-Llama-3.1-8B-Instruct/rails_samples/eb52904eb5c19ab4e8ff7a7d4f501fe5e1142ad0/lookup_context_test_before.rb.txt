VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential bug due to the use of the deprecated `assert_deprecated` block. This block is used to test deprecated code, but it is not necessary in this case, and its use can lead to unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_deprecated` block is used to test deprecated code, but in this case, the code is not deprecated. The block is used to wrap the test code, but it is not necessary, and its use can lead to unexpected behavior. The block is also not properly closed, which can cause issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the `assert_deprecated` block from the code. The code should be refactored to remove the unnecessary block and ensure that the test code is properly closed. This will prevent potential bugs and make the code more maintainable.  The `@lookup_context = @lookup_context.with_fallbacks` line should be moved inside the `assert_deprecated` block to ensure that the fallbacks are only added once.  The test should also be refactored to remove the duplicate assertions.  The test should be refactored to use the `
