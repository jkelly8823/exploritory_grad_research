VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of `Regexp.escape` on a string that is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape special characters in a string so that it can be used in a regular expression. However, if the input string is not properly sanitized, it can lead to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability, also known as a ReDoS attack. In this code, the `exts[ext].map { |e| e && Regexp.escape(".#{e}") }` line is vulnerable because it uses `Regexp.escape` on the `e` variable, which is not properly sanitized. This can lead to a ReDoS attack if the input string contains a large number of special characters.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer method to escape special characters, such as `URI.escape` or `CGI.escape`. Alternatively, you can use a regular expression that is designed to handle large input strings, such as `Regexp.union`. Additionally, you should ensure that the
