VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. This is because the `render` method is being called with a path that is constructed by concatenating a relative path with a directory name. An attacker could potentially manipulate the directory name to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `render` method is being called with a path that is constructed by concatenating a relative path with a directory name. This allows an attacker to manipulate the directory name to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, if the relative path is `../actionpack/test/fixtures/test/dot.directory/`, an attacker could access files in the parent directory by manipulating the directory name to `../actionpack/test/fixtures/test/dot.directory/../../../etc/passwd`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to construct the path, such as using the `File.join` method to join the relative path with the directory name. Additionally, the code should validate the directory name to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters. For example: `render file: File.join(Rails.root, 'actionpack', 'test', '
