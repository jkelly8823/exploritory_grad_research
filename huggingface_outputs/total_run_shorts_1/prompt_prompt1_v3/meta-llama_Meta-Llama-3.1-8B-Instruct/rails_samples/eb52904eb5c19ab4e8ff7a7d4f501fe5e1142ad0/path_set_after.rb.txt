VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential path traversal attack. This occurs when the `find_all` method is called with a path that contains a directory traversal character (`..`), allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `find_all` method does not properly sanitize the input path, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack. The `paths.each` loop iterates over a list of resolvers, which are expected to return a list of templates. However, if an attacker provides a path with a directory traversal character, they can access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `find_all` method should be modified to properly sanitize the input path. This can be achieved by using a library such as `Pathname` to normalize the path and prevent directory traversal attacks. Additionally, the `paths.each` loop should be modified to handle the case where an attacker provides a path with a directory traversal character. This can be achieved by using a library such as `FileUtils` to normalize the
