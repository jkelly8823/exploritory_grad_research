VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH` variable is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious paths.
EXPLANATION: The `FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH` variable is not validated or sanitized, which means an attacker could potentially inject malicious paths by manipulating this variable. This could lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker could access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH` variable should be sanitized and validated to ensure it only contains expected values. This could be done by using a whitelist approach, where only specific directories are allowed. Additionally, the `find_all` method should be reviewed to ensure it properly handles and validates user input.
