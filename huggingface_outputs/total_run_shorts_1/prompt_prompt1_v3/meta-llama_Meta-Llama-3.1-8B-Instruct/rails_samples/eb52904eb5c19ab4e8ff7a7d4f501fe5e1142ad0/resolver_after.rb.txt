VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `map!` method, which modifies the original array. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes if the `locals` array is modified externally.
EXPLANATION: The `map!` method is used to sort the `locals` array in place. However, if the `locals` array is modified externally while the sorting is in progress, it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes. This is because the `map!` method modifies the original array, and any external modifications to the array can cause the sorting to be interrupted or produce incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using the `map` method instead of `map!`, which returns a new sorted array without modifying the original array. This will prevent any external modifications to the `locals` array from affecting the sorting process. Additionally, consider using a thread-safe sorting algorithm to ensure that the sorting process is not interrupted by external modifications to the array. ```ruby
locals = locals.map(&:to_s).sort.freeze
``` ```ruby
