VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `get` method is being called with a parameter that is a string containing a path that is being interpreted as a file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate this path to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `get` method is being called with a parameter that is a string containing a path that is being interpreted as a file path. This path is being constructed by concatenating the `__dir__` method with a string containing a path. An attacker could potentially manipulate this path to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, if the `__dir__` method returns `/path/to/current/directory`, an attacker could manipulate the path to access files outside of this directory by including `../` in the path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a whitelist of allowed file paths or to use a library that can safely handle file paths. The `get` method should be called with a parameter that is a hash containing the file path, rather than a string containing the file path.
