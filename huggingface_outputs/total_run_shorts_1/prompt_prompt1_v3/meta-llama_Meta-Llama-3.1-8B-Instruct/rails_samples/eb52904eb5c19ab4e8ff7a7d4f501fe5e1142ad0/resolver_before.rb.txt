VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `map` method with the `!` modifier, which can lead to an infinite loop if the `locals` array contains a block that modifies the array.
EXPLANATION: The `map` method with the `!` modifier is used to sort the `locals` array in place. However, if the `locals` array contains a block that modifies the array, the `!` modifier will cause the `map` method to call the block repeatedly, leading to an infinite loop. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `map` method should be used without the `!` modifier, and the `sort` method should be called separately to sort the array in place. Additionally, the `freeze` method should be called separately to freeze the array. The corrected code should look like this: `locals = locals.map(&:to_s).sort.freeze`. This will prevent the infinite loop and ensure that the array is sorted and frozen correctly.
