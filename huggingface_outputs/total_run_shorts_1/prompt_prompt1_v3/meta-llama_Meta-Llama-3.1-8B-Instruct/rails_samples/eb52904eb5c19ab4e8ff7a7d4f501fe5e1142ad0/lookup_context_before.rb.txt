VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack due to the use of the `find_file` and `find_all` methods, which do not properly sanitize the input `name` parameter.
EXPLANATION: The `args_for_lookup` method is not shown in this code snippet, but it is likely that it does not properly validate the input `name` parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path traversal. This could lead to a security vulnerability where an attacker can access arbitrary files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `args_for_lookup` method should be modified to properly validate the input `name` parameter, ensuring that it does not contain any path traversal characters (e.g. `..`, `/`). Additionally, the `find_file` and `find_all` methods should be updated to use a whitelist of allowed directories or files, rather than relying on the `args_for_lookup` method to sanitize the input. This will help prevent an attacker from accessing arbitrary files on the system.  The `args_for_lookup` method should also be reviewed to ensure it does not contain any other potential vulnerabilities.
