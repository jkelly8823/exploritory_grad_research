VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of `Regexp.escape` on a string that is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape special characters in a string so that it can be used in a regular expression. However, if the input string is not properly sanitized, it can lead to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability, also known as a ReDoS attack. In this code, the `exts[ext].map { |e| e && Regexp.escape(".#{e}") }` line is vulnerable because it uses `Regexp.escape` on the `e` variable, which is not properly sanitized. This can lead to a ReDoS attack if an attacker can control the input of the `ext` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer method to escape special characters in the regular expression, such as using a library like `rubocop` to sanitize the input. Alternatively, you can use a more robust regular expression engine like `Oniguruma` which is designed to
