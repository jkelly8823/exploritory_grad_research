VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack. The `find_all` and `find_file` methods do not properly sanitize the `args` parameter, which can lead to an attacker injecting malicious SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The `find_all` and `find_file` methods use the `args` parameter to construct a SQL query. However, the `args` parameter is not properly sanitized, which means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `args` parameter. This can lead to a SQL injection attack, which can compromise the security of the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `find_all` and `find_file` methods should be modified to properly sanitize the `args` parameter. This can be done by using a parameterized query or by using a library that provides SQL injection protection, such as `ActiveRecord`. Additionally, the `args` parameter should be validated to ensure that it only contains valid input. This can be done by using a library such as `ActiveModel::Validations`.
