VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential path traversal vulnerability. The `find_file` method is called with the `options[:file]` parameter, which is not validated or sanitized. This allows an attacker to potentially traverse the file system and access sensitive files by manipulating the `options[:file]` parameter. The `with_fallbacks.find_file` method is not designed to handle user-supplied input, and it may not properly sanitize or validate the input, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `options[:file]` parameter should be validated and sanitized before passing it to the `find_file` method. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed file paths or by using a library that provides path sanitization. Additionally, the `find_file` method should be reviewed to ensure it properly handles user-supplied input and prevents path traversal attacks. The `ActiveSupport::Deprecation.warn` call should also be removed, as it does not provide any security benefits and may be misleading. Instead, a more informative error message should be displayed to
