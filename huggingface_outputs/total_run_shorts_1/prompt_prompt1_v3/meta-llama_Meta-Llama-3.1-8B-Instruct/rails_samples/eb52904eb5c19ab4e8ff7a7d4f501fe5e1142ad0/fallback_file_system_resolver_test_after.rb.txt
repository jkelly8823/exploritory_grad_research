VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH variable is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious paths.
EXPLANATION: The FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH variable is not validated or sanitized, which means an attacker could potentially inject malicious paths by manipulating this variable. This could lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker could access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH variable should be sanitized and validated to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed paths or by using a library that provides path validation. Additionally, the use of the FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH variable should be reviewed to ensure it is not used in a way that could lead to a path traversal attack.  The FIXTURE_LOAD_PATH variable should be validated and sanitized before being used in the find_all method. This can be achieved by using a library that provides path validation, such as the 'pathvalidate' gem.  The find_all method should be reviewed to ensure it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed paths
