 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential bug due to the use of deprecated methods. The `assert_deprecated` block is used to test deprecated code, but it is not clear if the code within the block is actually deprecated or not. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_deprecated` block is used to test deprecated code, but it is not clear if the code within the block is actually deprecated or not. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The code within the block is using the `with_fallbacks` method, which is not deprecated, but the block itself is marked as deprecated. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential bugs.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the `assert_deprecated` block is only used for actual deprecated code. If the code within the block is not deprecated, the block should be removed or modified to accurately reflect the code's status. Additionally, the code should be updated to use the latest methods and best practices to avoid potential bugs and errors.  The `assert_deprecated` block should be removed and the
