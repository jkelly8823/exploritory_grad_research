VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `get` method in the `test_dynamic_render_with_file` and `test_permitted_dynamic_render_file_hash` methods is not properly sanitizing the `params` hash, allowing an attacker to inject malicious file paths.
EXPLANATION: The `get` method is not validating the `params` hash, which can lead to a path traversal attack. An attacker can inject a malicious file path by manipulating the `id` parameter in the `params` hash. This can result in the server attempting to render a file that is outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `params` hash should be properly sanitized before being passed to the `get` method. This can be achieved by using a library like `rails-parameter` to validate and sanitize the input. Additionally, the `get` method should be modified to only allow specific file paths or directories, and to raise an error if an invalid file path is detected. For example: `get :dynamic_render_with_file, params: { id: File
