VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `options[:file]` parameter is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious file paths. The `ActiveSupport::Deprecation.warn` message is a red herring, as it does not address the underlying vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `options[:file]` parameter should be sanitized and validated to ensure it only accepts absolute paths. This can be achieved by using a library like `Pathname` to normalize the path and prevent directory traversal attacks. For example: `options[:file] = Pathname.new(options[:file]).expand_path` or `options[:file] = File.expand_path(options[:file])`. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the file extension and prevent malicious file types from being rendered.  ```ruby
            # Sanitize and validate the file path
            options[:file] = Pathname.new(options[:file]).expand_path
            # Validate the file extension
            if options[:file].extname!= ".erb
