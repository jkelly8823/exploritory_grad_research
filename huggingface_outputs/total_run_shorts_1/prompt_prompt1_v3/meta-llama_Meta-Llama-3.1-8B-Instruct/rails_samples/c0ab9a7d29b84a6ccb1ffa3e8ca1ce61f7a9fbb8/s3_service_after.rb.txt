 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `whitelist_headers` option in the `presigned_url` method. This option is not properly validated, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious headers into the presigned URL.
EXPLANATION: The `whitelist_headers` option is used to specify a list of headers that are allowed to be included in the presigned URL. However, in this code snippet, the `whitelist_headers` option is not properly validated, which means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious headers into the presigned URL. This could lead to a security vulnerability, such as a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `whitelist_headers` option should be properly validated to ensure that only allowed headers are included in the presigned URL. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed headers and checking that the provided headers are in the whitelist before including them in the presigned URL. Additionally, the `upload_options` hash should be validated to ensure that it does not contain any malicious keys or values. This can be done by using
