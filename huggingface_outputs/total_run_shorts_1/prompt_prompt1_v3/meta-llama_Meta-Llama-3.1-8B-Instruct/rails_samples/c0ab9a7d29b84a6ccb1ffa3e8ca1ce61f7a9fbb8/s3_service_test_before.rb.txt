VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of User.create! method which directly executes a SQL query without proper sanitization of user input.
EXPLANATION: The User.create! method is used to create a new user with the provided name and avatar. However, the name attribute is directly assigned a string value "DHH" which is not sanitized. If an attacker were to manipulate the name attribute to include malicious SQL code, it could lead to a SQL injection attack. This is a serious security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code on the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the User.create! method should be replaced with a parameterized query or an ORM that properly sanitizes user input. For example, using User.create(name: "DHH", avatar: blob) with a parameterized query or an ORM like ActiveRecord would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, it's recommended to validate and sanitize all user input to prevent similar attacks in the future.  ```ruby
User.create!(name: params[:name], avatar: blob)
```  would be a safer way to create a user.
