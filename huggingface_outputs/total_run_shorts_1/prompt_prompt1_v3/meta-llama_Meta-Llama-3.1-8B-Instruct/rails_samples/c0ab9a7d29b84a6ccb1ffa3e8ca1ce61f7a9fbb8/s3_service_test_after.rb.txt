 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of a hardcoded secret key in the `SecureRandom.base58(24)` function. This hardcoded key can be used to generate a predictable key, which can be exploited by an attacker to access sensitive data.
EXPLANATION: The `SecureRandom.base58(24)` function generates a random key using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. However, in this code snippet, the key is hardcoded, which means that an attacker can predict the key and use it to access sensitive data. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to generate a random key, such as `SecureRandom.uuid` or `SecureRandom.base64(24)`. Additionally, the code should ensure that the key is properly stored and protected to prevent unauthorized access. The `SecureRandom.base58(24)` function should be replaced with a more secure method to generate a random key. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all sensitive data is properly protected and that the key is not hardcoded
