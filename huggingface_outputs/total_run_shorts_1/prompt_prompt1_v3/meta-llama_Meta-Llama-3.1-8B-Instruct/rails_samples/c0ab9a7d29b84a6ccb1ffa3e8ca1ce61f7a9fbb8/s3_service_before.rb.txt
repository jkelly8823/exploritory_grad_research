 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of the `object_for` method, which may return a malicious object that can be used to inject SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The `object_for` method is called with a key that is not validated or sanitized, which means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the key to inject malicious SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or even a complete takeover of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the key before passing it to the `object_for` method. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed keys or by using a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the code should consider using a more secure method to generate the presigned URL, such as using a library like AWS Signature Version 4. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is not SQL injection, but rather a potential issue with the use of the `object_for` method. The explanation and recommendations provided are based on this assumption.
