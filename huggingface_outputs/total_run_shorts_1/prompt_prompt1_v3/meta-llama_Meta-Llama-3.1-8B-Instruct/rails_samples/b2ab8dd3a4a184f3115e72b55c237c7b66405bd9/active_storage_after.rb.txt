 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a configuration file for a Rails application, specifically for Active Storage. It defines several class-level attributes using the `mattr_accessor` method, which is a Rails-specific method for defining class-level attributes. The attributes are used to configure various settings for Active Storage, such as the content types to serve as binary, the content types allowed inline, and the routes prefix. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which are common types of vulnerabilities found in web applications. However, it is worth noting that the code does not include any validation or sanitization of user input, which could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if not properly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. However, it is recommended to add validation and sanitization of user input to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that all attributes are properly configured and validated to prevent any unexpected behavior.  ```bash
