 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `||` operator to set default values for ActiveStorage configuration variables. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the default values are not properly validated or sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `||` operator is used to provide default values for configuration variables if they are not set. However, this can lead to issues if the default values are not properly validated or sanitized. For example, if the `app.config.active_storage.resolve_model_to_route` is not set, it will default to `:rails_storage_redirect`, which may not be the intended behavior. Similarly, if the `app.config.active_storage.variable_content_types` is not set, it will default to an empty array, which may not be the intended behavior. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if the default values are not properly validated or sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more robust method to set default values, such as using a hash with default values or using a separate configuration file to store default values. Additionally, it is recommended to validate and sanitize any user-input data
