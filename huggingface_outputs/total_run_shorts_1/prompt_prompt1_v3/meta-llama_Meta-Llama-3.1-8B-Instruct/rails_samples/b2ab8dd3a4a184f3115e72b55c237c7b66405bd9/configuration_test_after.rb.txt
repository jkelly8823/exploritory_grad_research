 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `remove_from_config` method, which can be used to remove configuration settings that are necessary for the application's security. This can lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The `remove_from_config` method is used to remove configuration settings from the application's configuration. However, this method can be used to remove settings that are necessary for the application's security, such as the configuration for supported image processing methods and unsupported image processing arguments. This can lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `remove_from_config` method should be used with caution and only when necessary. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the configuration settings being removed are not necessary for the application's security. Additionally, the use of the `remove_from_config` method can be avoided by using other methods to configure the application, such as using environment variables or a separate configuration file.  The `remove_from_config` method should be removed or replaced with a safer alternative.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that all necessary configuration settings are
