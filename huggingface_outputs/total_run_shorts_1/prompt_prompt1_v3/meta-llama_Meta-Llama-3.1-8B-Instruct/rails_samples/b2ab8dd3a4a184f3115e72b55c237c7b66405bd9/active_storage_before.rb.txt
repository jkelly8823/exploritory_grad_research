VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a set of class attributes defined using the mattr_accessor method. The attributes are set with default values, which is a good practice. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure.  Please note that this code snippet is likely part of a larger Rails application, and the security of the application depends on many factors beyond this code snippet.  It is always a good idea to review the entire application for potential security vulnerabilities.  However, based on this code snippet alone, there are no obvious security issues.  It is also worth noting that the use of mattr_accessor is generally considered safe in Rails applications, as it is a part of the Rails framework.  However, it is always a good idea to review the code and ensure that it is being used correctly.  In this case, the code appears to be using mattr_accessor correctly.  The default values for the attributes are set, which is a good practice.  The attributes themselves do not appear to be vulnerable
