VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `||` operator to assign default values to ActiveStorage configuration variables. This can lead to unintended behavior if an attacker is able to manipulate the `app.config.active_storage` hash.
EXPLANATION: The `||` operator is used to provide a default value if the variable is `nil` or `false`. However, in this case, the default values are being assigned to sensitive configuration variables, such as `ActiveStorage.supported_image_processing_methods` and `ActiveStorage.unsupported_image_processing_arguments`. If an attacker is able to manipulate the `app.config.active_storage` hash, they may be able to inject malicious values into these variables, leading to potential security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the `||=` operator instead of the `||` operator to assign default values. This will ensure that the default values are only assigned if the variable is `nil`, and not if it is `false`. Additionally, it is recommended to validate and sanitize any user-input data that is being used to configure ActiveStorage. This can be done by
