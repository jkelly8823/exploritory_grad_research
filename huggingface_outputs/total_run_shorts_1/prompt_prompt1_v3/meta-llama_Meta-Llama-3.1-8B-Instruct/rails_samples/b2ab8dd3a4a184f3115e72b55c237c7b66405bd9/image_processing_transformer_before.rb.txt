VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an error when the `combine_options` transformation is encountered. This is because the `operations` method raises an `ArgumentError` when it encounters this transformation, but it does not handle the case where the transformation is not present in the `transformations` array.
EXPLANATION: The `operations` method iterates over the `transformations` array and checks if the transformation name is equal to `"combine_options"`. If it is, it raises an `ArgumentError`. However, if the transformation is not present in the array, the method will not raise an error, but it will also not perform any operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that the transformation is present in the `transformations` array before raising the `ArgumentError`. You can do this by using the `include?` method to check if the transformation name is present in the array. If it is not present, you can return an empty array or raise a different error. For example: `if transformations.include?("combine_options") && name
