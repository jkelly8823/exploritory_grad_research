VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the `test_sum_with_type_cast` method. The `@connection.execute` method is used to execute a SQL query with user input data. The input data is not properly sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. In this case, the input data is a string that is concatenated with a SQL query, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user input data. For example, you can use the `@connection.execute` method with a parameterized query like this: `@connection.execute("INSERT INTO postgresql_moneys (id, wealth) VALUES ($1, $2)", 1, '123.45'::money)`. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract away the underlying database operations and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.  VULNERABLE: YES
