VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The regular expressions used in the code are vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, which can lead to a denial of service attack. This is because the regular expressions are not anchored to the start of the string, allowing the regex engine to backtrack and try different possibilities, leading to exponential time complexity. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the program to consume excessive resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expressions should be anchored to the start of the string using the '^' character. Additionally, the regular expressions should be optimized to avoid backtracking. This can be done by using possessive quantifiers, such as '+*', and by avoiding the use of lazy quantifiers, such as '.*'. The regular expressions should also be tested for performance and security to ensure they are not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. 

Note: The lines (1) and (2) in the code snippet are the ones that contain the regular expressions that are vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
