VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The regular expressions used in the code are vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, which can lead to a denial of service attack. This is because the regular expressions are not anchored to the start of the string, allowing the regex engine to backtrack and try different possibilities, leading to exponential time complexity.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expressions should be anchored to the start of the string using the '^' character. Additionally, the regular expressions should be optimized to avoid backtracking. This can be done by using possessive quantifiers, such as '+*', or by using a more efficient regex engine, such as the 'oniguruma' engine. For example, the regular expression '/^-?\D*[\d,]+\.\d{2}$/' can be replaced with '/\A^-?\D*[\d,]+\.\d{2}\z/', and the regular expression '/^-?\D*[\d.]+,\d{2}$/' can be replaced with '/\A^-?\D*[\d.]+,\d{2
