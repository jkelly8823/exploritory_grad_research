VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression with a large number of repetitions, which can cause the system to hang or crash.
EXPLANATION: The code in the test_money_regex_backtracking method uses a regular expression with a large number of repetitions (100000) to test the PostgresqlMoney type. This can cause the system to hang or crash due to the excessive backtracking required by the regular expression engine. This is a classic example of a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to use a more efficient algorithm or to limit the number of repetitions. One possible solution is to use a possessive quantifier (e.g., "+*") to prevent backtracking. Alternatively, the regular expression can be rewritten to use a more efficient algorithm, such as a finite state machine. Additionally, the timeout value can be increased to allow for more time to process the regular expression. However, this may not be sufficient to prevent a DoS attack, and a more robust solution is recommended.  The use of a
