VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The `strip_tags` method is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks, as it only removes HTML tags, but does not prevent JavaScript code from being executed. Additionally, the `html_safe?` method is used incorrectly, as it does not prevent XSS attacks.
EXPLANATION: The `strip_tags` method is used to remove HTML tags from a string, but it does not prevent JavaScript code from being executed. This means that if an attacker can inject JavaScript code into the application, they can execute arbitrary code on the client-side. The `html_safe?` method is used to mark a string as safe for HTML rendering, but it does not prevent XSS attacks. In this code, the `strip_tags` method is used to remove HTML tags from a string, but the `html_safe?` method is used incorrectly, as it does not prevent XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more robust method to prevent XSS attacks, such as the `sanitize` method, which removes
