VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly sanitize user input, which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This is because the strip_tags function is not being used correctly to remove all script tags.
EXPLANATION: The strip_tags function is being used to remove HTML tags from a string, but it is not being used to remove script tags. This means that if a malicious user were to input a string containing a script tag, the strip_tags function would not remove it, allowing the script to be executed. The code also uses the html_escape function to escape HTML characters, but this is not enough to prevent XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the strip_tags function should be used to remove all script tags from the input string. This can be done by using the strip_tags function with the option to remove script tags, like this: strip_tags(blank, '<script>'). The html_escape function should also be used to escape any remaining HTML characters. Additionally, the sanitize function should be used to mark the sanitized string as safe, like this: sanitize("<html><script></script></html>").html_safe? should be changed to sanitize("<
