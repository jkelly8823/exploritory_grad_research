VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The strip_tags method is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it uses the full_sanitizer.sanitize method which does not properly sanitize HTML tags, allowing malicious code to be injected.
EXPLANATION: The strip_tags method is intended to remove HTML tags from a string, but it uses the full_sanitizer.sanitize method which is not designed to remove all HTML tags. This allows malicious code to be injected, potentially leading to XSS attacks. The sanitize method is intended to remove malicious code, but it does not remove all HTML tags, making it vulnerable to attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the strip_tags method should be modified to use a more robust HTML sanitizer, such as the Nokogiri library, which can properly remove all HTML tags. Alternatively, the method could be modified to use a whitelist approach, where only specific, safe HTML tags are allowed. This would prevent malicious code from being injected. For example: def strip_tags(html) html.gsub(/<.*?>/,'') end. This would remove all HTML tags from the string, preventing XSS attacks.  However, this approach may not be suitable for all use cases, as it
