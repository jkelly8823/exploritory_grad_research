VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The strip_tags method is vulnerable to XSS attacks because it uses the full_sanitizer which does not properly sanitize HTML tags.
EXPLANATION: The full_sanitizer is not designed to remove all HTML tags, it is designed to sanitize them. This means that it will not remove malicious HTML tags, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the application. This is a serious vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The strip_tags method should be modified to use a sanitizer that properly removes all HTML tags, such as the white_list_sanitizer. The method should also be modified to remove any HTML tags that are not in the white list. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious code into the application. For example, the method could be modified as follows: def strip_tags(html) self.class.white_list_sanitizer.sanitize(html) end. This will ensure that only the specified HTML tags are allowed in the application.  Additionally, the method should be modified to remove any HTML tags that are not in the white list. This can be done by using the remove_tags method provided by the sanitizer. For
