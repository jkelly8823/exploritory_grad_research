 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `assert_equal` method with user-provided input. This can lead to a potential code injection vulnerability if the input is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_equal` method is used to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `number_to_currency` method. However, if the input to the `number_to_currency` method is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code by providing a specially crafted input. This could lead to a code injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize the input to the `number_to_currency` method. This can be done by using a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensuring that only expected characters are allowed. Additionally, the use of `assert_equal` with user-provided input should be avoided in favor of using a more secure method of comparison. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is not in the provided code snippet, but rather in the potential use of the `assert_equal` method with user-provided input in a larger context. The provided code snippet
