VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack. This is because the `options[:delimiter]` and `options[:separator]` variables are not properly sanitized before being used in a string interpolation.
EXPLANATION: The `html_escape` method is used to prevent XSS attacks, but it does not prevent SQL injection attacks. The `html_safe?` method is used to check if a string is safe to be used in an HTML context, but it does not prevent SQL injection attacks. In this code snippet, the `options[:delimiter]` and `options[:separator]` variables are not properly sanitized before being used in a string interpolation, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a parameterized query or a library that properly sanitizes user input, such as `ActiveRecord` or `pg`. You should also validate and sanitize the `options[:delimiter]` and `options[:separator]` variables before using them in a string interpolation. For example, you can use the `sanitize` method from the `sanitize` gem to sanitize the variables. Additionally, you should consider using
