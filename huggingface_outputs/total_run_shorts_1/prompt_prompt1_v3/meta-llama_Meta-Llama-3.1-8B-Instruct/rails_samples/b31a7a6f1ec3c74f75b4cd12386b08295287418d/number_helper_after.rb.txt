VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `escape_unsafe_delimiters_and_separators` does not properly sanitize user input. It uses `html_escape` to escape HTML special characters, but it does not prevent XSS attacks. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the `options` hash.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `wrap_with_output_safety_handling` does not check if the `number` parameter is an integer before passing it to the `block` parameter. This could lead to a potential error if the `number` parameter is not an integer.
