VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the assert_equal method. This method can be used to inject malicious code by an attacker who has control over the input values being compared. This is a classic example of a "code injection" vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The assert_equal method is used to compare two values and raise an assertion error if they are not equal. However, if the input values are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious code by crafting a specially formatted input value. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to compare values, such as the == operator. Additionally, the input values should be properly sanitized to prevent code injection attacks. For example, the code could use the strip method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input values before comparing them. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).  The use of assert_equal should be avoided in favor of more secure methods such as assert or expect
