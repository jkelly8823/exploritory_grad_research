 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of deprecated methods. The `assert_deprecated` method is used in the `test_render_file` and `test_render_file_with_locals` methods, which may indicate that the code is using deprecated functionality. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the deprecated methods are removed or modified in future versions of the framework or library being used.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_deprecated` method is used to test deprecated methods, but it may also indicate that the code is using deprecated functionality. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the deprecated methods are removed or modified in future versions of the framework or library being used. The code is also using the `buffered_render` method, which may be deprecated or have security implications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not using any deprecated methods or functionality. The `assert_deprecated` method should be removed or replaced with a more secure alternative. Additionally, the `buffered_render` method should be reviewed to ensure that it is secure and not deprecated. If it is deprecated, it should be replaced with a more
