VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape the file name, but it does not properly escape all special characters. An attacker could craft a malicious file name that, when used in the regular expression, would cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the code is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks because it uses the `Regexp.escape` method to escape the file name. However, this method does not properly escape all special characters, which can be used by an attacker to craft a malicious file name that would cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources. This is a classic example of a ReDoS attack, where an attacker can cause the regular expression engine to take an excessive amount of time to match the regular expression, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to use a more robust method of escaping special characters, such as the `String#scan` method. Additionally, the
