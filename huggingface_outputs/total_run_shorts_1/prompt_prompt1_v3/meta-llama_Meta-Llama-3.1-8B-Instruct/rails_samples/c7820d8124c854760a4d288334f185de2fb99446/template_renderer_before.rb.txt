VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `find_file` method does not properly sanitize the input file path, allowing an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `find_file` method takes the file path as an argument, but it does not validate or sanitize the input. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the file path to access sensitive files on the system. For example, if the attacker passes a file path like `../../../etc/passwd`, the method could potentially return the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, revealing sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `find_file` method should be modified to properly sanitize the input file path. This can be done by using a library like `Pathname` to normalize the file path and prevent path traversal attacks. Additionally, the method should be modified to check for any suspicious characters in the file path, such as `..` or `/`. If any suspicious characters are detected, the method should raise an error or return an error message. ```ruby
