VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `File.exist?` check is not sufficient to prevent an attacker from accessing arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `File.exist?` check only verifies that the file exists, but does not check if the file is accessible or if it is a directory. An attacker could potentially access sensitive files or directories by manipulating the `options[:file]` parameter. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `File.expand_path` method to ensure that the file path is absolute and does not contain any relative paths. You should also use the `File.directory?` method to check if the file is a directory before attempting to access it. Additionally, you should consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the files that can be accessed. For example, you could only allow access to files within a specific directory or with a specific extension. ```ruby
if File.expand_path(options[:file]).start_with?(Rails.root.join('public'))
  # allow access to files within the public directory
elsif File.directory
