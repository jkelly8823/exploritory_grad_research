 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of deprecated methods and assertions that may not be reliable in all scenarios.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `assert_deprecated` method, which is deprecated and may not behave as expected in certain situations. Additionally, the assertions used in the code may not be reliable in all scenarios, as they rely on the `assert_match` and `assert_equal` methods, which may not catch all potential issues. Furthermore, the code uses the `File.expand_path` method to resolve file paths, which may lead to security issues if not used correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be refactored to use modern and reliable methods for assertions and file path resolution. The `assert_deprecated` method should be replaced with a more reliable assertion method, and the file path resolution should be done using a more secure method, such as `Pathname`. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all assertions are reliable and catch all potential issues.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all deprecated methods are replaced with modern and reliable alternatives.  The code should also be reviewed to
