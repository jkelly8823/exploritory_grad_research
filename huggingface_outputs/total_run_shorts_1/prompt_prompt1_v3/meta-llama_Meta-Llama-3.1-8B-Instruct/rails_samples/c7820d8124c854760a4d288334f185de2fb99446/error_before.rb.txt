VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the `Regexp.escape` method is used to escape the file name, but it does not prevent the regular expression from being used as a pattern to match against the entire input string.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `/#{Regexp.escape File.basename(file_name)}:(\d+)/` is used to match the file name and line number in the backtrace. However, if the file name contains a large number of special characters, the regular expression can become very large and complex, leading to a denial of service attack. This is because the regular expression engine has to iterate over the entire input string to determine whether it matches the pattern, which can take a long time for large inputs.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can use a more efficient regular expression that does not rely on `Regexp.escape`. For example, you can use a regular expression that matches the file name and line number in a more limited way, such as `/#{File.basename(file_name)}:(\d+)/`. Additionally, you can consider using a more
