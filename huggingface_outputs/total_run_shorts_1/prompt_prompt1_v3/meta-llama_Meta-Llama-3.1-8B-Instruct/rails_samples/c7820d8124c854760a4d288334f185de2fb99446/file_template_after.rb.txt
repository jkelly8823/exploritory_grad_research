VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `@filename` variable is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `source` method reads a file from disk using `::File.binread`. However, the `@filename` variable is not validated or sanitized, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate this variable to read files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the `@filename` variable to ensure it only points to files within the intended directory. You can use the `Pathname` class to achieve this. For example, you could use `Pathname.new(@filename).expand_path` to ensure the file path is within the intended directory. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific file paths to be read. This will help prevent arbitrary file reads and reduce the attack surface.  ```ruby
    def source
      Pathname.new(@filename).expand_path
    end
    ```  ```ruby
    def source
