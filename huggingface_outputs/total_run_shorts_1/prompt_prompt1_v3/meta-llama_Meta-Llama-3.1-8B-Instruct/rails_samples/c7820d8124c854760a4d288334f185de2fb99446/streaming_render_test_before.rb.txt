VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of ERb (Embedded RuBy) templating engine without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Ruby code, potentially leading to code injection attacks.
EXPLANATION: The `buffered_render` method is not shown in this code snippet, but it is likely using ERb to render templates. ERb allows the use of Ruby code within templates, which can be a security risk if not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious Ruby code, leading to code injection attacks. This is a significant security concern, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `buffered_render` method should be modified to properly sanitize any user-input data before rendering the template. This can be done by using a library like ERb::Util to escape any user-input data. Additionally, consider using a safer templating engine like ERb::Safe or a third-party library like Liquid. It's also a good practice to validate and sanitize any user-input data before passing it to the `buffered_render` method.
