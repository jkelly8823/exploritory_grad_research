VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of `assert_match` with a regular expression that may match arbitrary strings. This could lead to a false positive or false negative assertion, potentially masking or revealing a security vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_match` method is used to verify that a string matches a regular expression. However, the regular expression used in this code snippet is quite broad and may match strings that are not intended to be matched. For example, the regular expression `/You invoked render but did not give any of (.+) option\./` may match strings that contain the phrase "You invoked render" followed by any characters, potentially including sensitive information. This could lead to a false positive assertion, where a security vulnerability is reported when none exists. Conversely, if the regular expression does not match a string that it should, it may lead to a false negative assertion, where a security vulnerability is not reported when one exists.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, the regular expression used in the `assert_match` method should be made more specific to only match the intended strings. This can be achieved by using a more
