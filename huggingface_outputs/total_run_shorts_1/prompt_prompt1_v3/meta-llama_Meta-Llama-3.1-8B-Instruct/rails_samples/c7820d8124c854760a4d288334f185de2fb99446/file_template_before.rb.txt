 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `File.binread` method does not perform any validation on the file path, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `File.binread` method is used to read a binary file from disk. However, it does not perform any validation on the file path, which means that an attacker can manipulate the `@filename` variable to read arbitrary files on the system. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `Pathname` class to validate the file path before passing it to `File.binread`. You can use the `Pathname#cleanpath` method to remove any directory traversal characters from the path. For example: `Pathname.new(@filename).cleanpath.to_s`. This will ensure that the file path is safe and cannot be manipulated by an attacker. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure method to read files, such as `File.open` with the `rb` mode, which will also help to prevent path traversal attacks. ```ruby
