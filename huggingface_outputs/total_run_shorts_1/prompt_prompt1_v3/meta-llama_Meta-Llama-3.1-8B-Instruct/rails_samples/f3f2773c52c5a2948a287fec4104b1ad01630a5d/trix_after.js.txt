VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a DOM-based XSS attack due to the use of `HTMLSanitizer.sanitize()` without proper validation of the input HTML.
EXPLANATION: The `HTMLSanitizer.sanitize()` function is used to sanitize user-input HTML, but it does not properly validate the input HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code, which can be executed by the browser, leading to a DOM-based XSS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more robust HTML sanitizer library, such as DOMPurify, which properly validates and sanitizes user-input HTML. Additionally, you should validate the input HTML before passing it to the sanitizer library to prevent any malicious code from being executed. You can use a library like `html-escaper` to escape any special characters in the input HTML before sanitizing it. Here is an example of how you can use DOMPurify to sanitize the HTML: `const sanitizedHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(html, { ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p','span'], ALLOWED_ATTR: ['style'] });` Make sure to update the `ALLOWED
