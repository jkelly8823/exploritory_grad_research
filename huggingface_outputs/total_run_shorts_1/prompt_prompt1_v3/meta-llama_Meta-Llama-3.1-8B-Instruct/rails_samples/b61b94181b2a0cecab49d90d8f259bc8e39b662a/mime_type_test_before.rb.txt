VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential nil pointer dereference error. This is because the Mime::Type.new method is called with a nil argument, which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The Mime::Type.new method is called with a nil argument, which could lead to a nil pointer dereference error. This is because the nil argument is not checked for before being passed to the method. In Ruby, calling a method on a nil object will raise a NoMethodError, but in this case, the method is called with a nil argument, which could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check for nil arguments before passing them to the Mime::Type.new method. This can be done by adding a simple nil check before calling the method. For example: if argument.nil? then raise ArgumentError, "Argument cannot be nil" end. This will prevent the potential nil pointer dereference error and provide a more robust solution.  The Mime::Type.new method should also be modified to handle nil arguments and raise a meaningful error message.  This can be done by adding a simple check
