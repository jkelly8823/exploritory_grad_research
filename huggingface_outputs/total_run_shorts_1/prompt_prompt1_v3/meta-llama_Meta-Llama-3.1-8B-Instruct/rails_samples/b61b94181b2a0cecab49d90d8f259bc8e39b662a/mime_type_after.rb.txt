 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a complex regular expression with a large number of possible matches.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the MIME_REGEXP variable is complex and can lead to catastrophic backtracking, which can cause the program to consume excessive resources and potentially crash. This is a known vulnerability in regular expressions, and it can be exploited by an attacker to launch a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more robust regular expression engine, such as the Oniguruma engine, or use a simpler regular expression that is less prone to catastrophic backtracking. Additionally, consider using a library that provides a safe and efficient way to handle regular expressions, such as the're2' library. It's also a good practice to limit the number of possible matches by using possessive quantifiers or atomic grouping. For example, you can replace the MIME_REGEXP variable with a simpler regular expression like /\A(?:\*\/\*|#{MIME_NAME}\/(?:\*|#{MIME_NAME})(?>\s*
