VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the potential for an excessively long mime type string.
EXPLANATION: The Mime::Type.new method is called with a string that contains a very long list of semicolon-separated values. This could potentially cause the method to take an excessive amount of time to process, leading to a denial-of-service attack. This is because the method may need to iterate over each value in the string, which could be very time-consuming if the string is very long.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the length of the mime type string before passing it to the Mime::Type.new method. This could be done by checking the length of the string and raising an error if it exceeds a certain threshold. Additionally, the code could consider using a more efficient data structure to store the mime types, such as a hash or a trie, which would allow for faster lookup and iteration.  The Mime::Type.new method should also be designed to handle very long strings in a way that does not cause a denial-of-service attack. This could be done by using a streaming approach
