VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential security issue due to the use of the `sanitize_content_attachment` method without proper validation of the input. This method is used to sanitize the content of an attachment, but it does not check if the input is a string or not. If an attacker provides a non-string input, it could lead to a security vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `sanitize_content_attachment` method is used to sanitize the content of an attachment. However, it does not check if the input is a string or not. This could lead to a security vulnerability if an attacker provides a non-string input. The `sanitize_content_attachment` method is called with the `node["content"]` as an argument, which is not guaranteed to be a string. This could lead to a security vulnerability if the input is not a string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the input is a string before calling the `sanitize_content_attachment` method. You can use the `String` class's `===` method to check if the input is a string. If it is not a string, you should raise an error
