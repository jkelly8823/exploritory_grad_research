 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of `sanitize_action_text_content` and `sanitize_content_attachment` methods which allow user-generated content to be sanitized but do not account for the possibility of malicious JavaScript code being injected.
EXPLANATION: The `sanitize_action_text_content` and `sanitize_content_attachment` methods use the `sanitize` method from the `sanitizer` object to sanitize user-generated content. However, the `sanitize` method only allows a limited set of tags and attributes, which can be bypassed by an attacker who injects malicious JavaScript code. This can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more robust sanitization library, such as `DOMPurify`, which can remove malicious JavaScript code. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all user-generated content is properly sanitized before being rendered. The `sanitize_action_text_content` and `sanitize_content_attachment` methods should be updated to use the `DOMPurify` library and to account for the
