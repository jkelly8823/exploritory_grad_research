VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `escape_once` is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the regular expression `/[\"><]|&(?!([a-zA-Z]+|(#\d+));)/` can take a very long time to execute for certain inputs, potentially causing a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression in question is a complex one, and it uses a negative lookahead assertion to match certain HTML entities. However, this assertion can be exploited by an attacker to create a catastrophic backtracking scenario, where the regular expression engine takes a very long time to execute. This can be done by crafting a specially designed input that causes the regular expression engine to repeat the same steps over and over again, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, we can use a more efficient regular expression that does not use a negative lookahead assertion. One possible solution is to use the `String#scan` method to find all occurrences of the HTML entities, and then use a loop to replace them. Alternatively, we can use a library like `sanitize` that is designed to handle HTML escaping
