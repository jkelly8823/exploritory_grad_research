VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function escape_once is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the regular expression used in the gsub method contains a pattern that can cause the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the gsub method is /[\"><]|&(?!([a-zA-Z]+|(#\d+));)/. This regular expression contains a negative lookahead assertion (?!...) that can cause the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop if the input string contains a large number of characters that match the pattern. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to use a possessive quantifier (+?) instead of a greedy quantifier (*). This will prevent the regular expression engine from entering an infinite loop. The modified regular expression would be /[\"><]|&(?!([a-zA-Z]+|(#\d+));)/+?. The function escape_once should also be modified to use the modified regular expression. Additionally, the function should be modified to use a
