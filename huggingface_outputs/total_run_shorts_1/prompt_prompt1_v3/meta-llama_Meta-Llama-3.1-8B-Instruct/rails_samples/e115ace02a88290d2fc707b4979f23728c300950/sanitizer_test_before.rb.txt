 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code is not properly sanitizing user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a whitelist sanitizer to sanitize user input, but it is not properly configured to prevent XSS attacks. The vulnerability is present in the first four lines of the code, where the code is using the `%(<IMG SRC="...")` syntax to create a string that contains malicious JavaScript code. This code is then passed to the `assert_sanitized` method, which is not properly configured to prevent XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly configure the whitelist sanitizer to prevent XSS attacks. This can be done by adding the `javascript` protocol to the whitelist, or by using a more robust sanitizer that can prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, the code should be modified to properly sanitize user input before passing it to the `assert_sanitized` method. This can be done by using a library such as `sanitize` to remove any malicious code from the input
