VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a complex regular expression with a large number of possible matches.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used to match the protocol separator is overly complex and can lead to catastrophic backtracking, which can cause the program to consume excessive resources and potentially crash. This is a known vulnerability in regular expressions, and it can be exploited by an attacker to launch a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be simplified and made more efficient. One possible solution is to use a simpler regular expression that only matches the specific characters that are expected, such as `self.protocol_separator = /[:/]/i`. Additionally, the `allowed_protocols` set should be checked before attempting to match the protocol separator, to prevent unnecessary regular expression evaluations. ```python
    def contains_bad_protocols?(attr_name, value)
      uri_attributes.include?(attr_name) &&
      (allowed_protocols.include?(value.split(self.protocol_separator).first.downcase.strip) ||!value =~ self.protocol_separator)
    end
``` ```python
