 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of a complex regular expression in the `protocol_separator` variable. This regular expression can cause the `contains_bad_protocols?` method to take an excessive amount of time to execute when given a malicious input.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression in the `protocol_separator` variable is complex and can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack. The regular expression contains multiple alternatives and character classes, which can cause the regular expression engine to take a long time to execute when given a malicious input. This can lead to a denial of service attack, where the system becomes unresponsive due to the excessive time taken by the regular expression engine.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression in the `protocol_separator` variable should be simplified and made more efficient. One way to do this is to use a simpler regular expression that only matches the colon character. Additionally, the `contains_bad_protocols?` method should be modified to use a more efficient algorithm for checking the protocol, such as using a set of allowed protocols instead of a regular
