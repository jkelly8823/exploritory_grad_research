VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks due to the use of unsanitized user input in the assert_sanitized method. The method does not properly sanitize the input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the HTML::WhiteListSanitizer to sanitize user input, but it is not properly configured to handle all types of XSS attacks. The use of JavaScript code in the input strings, such as "javascript:alert('XSS');", can be executed by the browser, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This is a classic example of an XSS vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the assert_sanitized method should be modified to properly sanitize the input using a more robust sanitizer, such as the Rails built-in sanitize method. Additionally, the method should be updated to handle all types of XSS attacks, including those that use JavaScript code. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized before being used in the application. 

Note: The code is using the HTML::WhiteListSanitizer, which is a custom sanitizer, and it
