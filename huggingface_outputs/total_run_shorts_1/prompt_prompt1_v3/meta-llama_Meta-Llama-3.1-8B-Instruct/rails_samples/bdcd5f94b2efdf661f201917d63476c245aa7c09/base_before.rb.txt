VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential ActionNotFound exception when the action is not found. This is because the method_for_action method does not handle the case where the action_name is nil or empty.
EXPLANATION: The method_for_action method checks if the action_name is an action method using the action_method? method. However, it does not check if the action_name is nil or empty before calling the action_method? method. If the action_name is nil or empty, the action_method? method will raise an exception, and the method_for_action method will not handle this exception, leading to an ActionNotFound exception.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the action_name is not nil or empty before calling the action_method? method. You can do this by adding a simple if statement to check if the action_name is nil or empty, and return nil or raise an exception if it is. For example: if action_name.nil? || action_name.empty?; return nil; end. This will prevent the ActionNotFound exception from being raised when the action_name is nil or empty.
