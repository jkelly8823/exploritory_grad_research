VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential action name spoofing attack. An attacker could potentially pass a malicious action name that contains a directory separator, which could lead to unintended behavior or even code execution.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability lies in the `_valid_action_name?` method, which uses a regular expression to check if the action name contains a directory separator. However, this regular expression is not sufficient to prevent all types of malicious input. An attacker could potentially pass a specially crafted action name that contains a directory separator, which could lead to unintended behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `_valid_action_name?` method should be modified to use a more robust regular expression that can prevent all types of malicious input. For example, it could use a regular expression that matches any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore. Additionally, the method should be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `validate_action_name`. The `method_for_action` method should also be modified to handle the case where the action name is not valid, and raise an `ActionNotFound` exception instead of returning `nil`. Finally
