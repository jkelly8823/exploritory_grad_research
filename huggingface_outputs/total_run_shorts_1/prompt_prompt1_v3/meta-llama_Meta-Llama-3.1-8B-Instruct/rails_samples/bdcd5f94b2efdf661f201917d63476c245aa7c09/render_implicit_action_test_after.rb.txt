VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `action_name` variable is not properly sanitized before being used to access the file system. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `action_name` variable to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `action_name` variable is constructed by joining multiple strings together using `File::SEPARATOR`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `action_name` variable by including `..` or other directory traversal characters. For example, an attacker could set `action_name` to `../evil.rb` to access a malicious file. The `available_action?` method does not properly sanitize the `action_name` variable, allowing the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `action_name` variable should be sanitized before being used to access the file system. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides path sanitization. Additionally, the `available_action?` method should be modified to properly sanitize the `action_name` variable before checking if it is an available action. This can
