VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of =~ operator on user-controlled input (remote_addr and remote_ip) without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The =~ operator in Ruby is used for pattern matching and can be exploited for SQL injection attacks if used on user-controlled input without proper sanitization. In this case, the code is using =~ on remote_addr and remote_ip, which are likely user-controlled input. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially extract sensitive data or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The =~ operator should be replaced with a parameterized query or a prepared statement. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize user-controlled input to prevent any potential attacks. For example, the code can use the `params` hash to pass parameters to the query, and use a library like `pg` or `mysql2` to execute the query with parameterized values. The `deep_munge` method can be used to remove nils from the params hash, but it should be
