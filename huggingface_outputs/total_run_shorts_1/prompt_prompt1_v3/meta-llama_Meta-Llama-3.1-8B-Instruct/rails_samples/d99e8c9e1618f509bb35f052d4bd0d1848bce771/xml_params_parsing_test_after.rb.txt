 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to XML injection attacks. This is because the `assert_parses` method does not properly sanitize the input XML, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary XML code.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_parses` method uses the `post` method to send an XML payload to the `/parse` endpoint. However, it does not validate or sanitize the input XML, making it vulnerable to XML injection attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious XML payload that would be executed by the `/parse` endpoint, potentially leading to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `assert_parses` method should be modified to properly sanitize the input XML. This can be done by using a library such as `Nokogiri` to parse the XML and remove any malicious tags or attributes. Additionally, the `/parse` endpoint should be modified to validate and sanitize the input XML before processing it. This can be done by using a library such as `RexML` to parse the XML and remove any malicious tags or attributes. The `default_headers` hash should also be validated to ensure that it does not contain any malicious headers.
