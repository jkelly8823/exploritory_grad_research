VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: YAML.load() is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to the potential for a malicious YAML file to contain a malicious payload.
EXPLANATION: The YAML.load() function is not safe to use with untrusted input. It can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary code. This is because YAML is a markup language that can contain arbitrary Ruby code. An attacker could craft a malicious YAML file that, when loaded, would execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a serious security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the safe_load method instead of load. This method will prevent the execution of arbitrary code. The safe_load method will raise an exception if the YAML file contains any malicious code. The code should be modified to use safe_load instead of load. For example: YAML.safe_load(request.raw_post) instead of YAML.load(request.raw_post). This will prevent the execution of arbitrary code and ensure the security of the application.  Additionally, ensure that the YAML file is properly sanitized and validated before loading it. This can be done by using a library such as yaml-sanitizer.  It is also recommended to use a whitelist approach to validate the YAML file,
