VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: YAML.load() is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to the potential for a malicious YAML file to contain a "require" statement.
EXPLANATION: The YAML.load() function in Ruby is a powerful tool for parsing YAML data, but it can also be used to execute arbitrary Ruby code if the YAML data contains a "require" statement. This is because YAML.load() will execute any Ruby code it encounters, including "require" statements, which can load and execute arbitrary Ruby code. This makes it a potential vector for arbitrary code execution attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Instead of using YAML.load(), consider using YAML.safe_load() which is a safer alternative that does not execute arbitrary Ruby code. If you need to execute arbitrary Ruby code, consider using a safer alternative such as eval() with a whitelist of allowed methods. Additionally, consider validating and sanitizing any user-input YAML data before parsing it to prevent potential attacks.  Also, consider using a YAML parser that does not execute arbitrary Ruby code, such as the "psych" library.  Finally, consider using a safer alternative to YAML, such as JSON, for data exchange.  Always validate and sanitize any
