VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of a user-supplied value in a database query.
EXPLANATION: The `Edge.where(blank)` method is using the `blank` variable directly in the database query. This variable can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the user-supplied input from the SQL code. For example, you can use the `where` method with a hash of conditions, like `Edge.where(sink_id: blank)`. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like ActiveRecord to help protect against SQL injection attacks.  Also, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.  This will help prevent unexpected input from causing issues.  Consider using a library like `rails-secure` to help secure your application.  Consider using a linter to catch potential issues before they become vulnerabilities.  Consider using a code analysis
