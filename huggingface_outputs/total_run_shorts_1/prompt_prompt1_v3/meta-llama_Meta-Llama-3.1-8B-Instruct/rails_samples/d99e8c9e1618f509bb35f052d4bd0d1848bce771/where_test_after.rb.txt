VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack. The `where` method is being used with user-supplied input (the `blank` variable) without proper sanitization or parameterization.
EXPLANATION: The `where` method in Active Record is used to filter records based on a set of conditions. However, when used with user-supplied input, it can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. In this code, the `blank` variable is being used to filter records, but it is not being properly sanitized or parameterized. This means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `blank` variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `where` method should be used with parameterized queries, such as `where("sink_id =?", blank)`. Alternatively, the `where` method can be used with a hash of conditions, such as `where(sink: blank)`, which will automatically parameterize the query. Additionally, the `blank` variable should be validated and sanitized before being used in the query to prevent any potential SQL injection attacks.  The `test_where_with_table_name_and_empty_array
