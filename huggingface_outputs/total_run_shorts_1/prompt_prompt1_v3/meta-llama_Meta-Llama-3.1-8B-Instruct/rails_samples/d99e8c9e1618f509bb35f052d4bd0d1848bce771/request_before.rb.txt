VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of =~ operator on user-controlled input (remote_addr and remote_ip) without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The =~ operator in Ruby is used for pattern matching, but it can be exploited for SQL injection attacks if used on user-controlled input without proper sanitization. In this case, the code is using =~ on remote_addr and remote_ip, which are likely user-controlled input. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially extract sensitive data or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The =~ operator should be replaced with a safe method for pattern matching, such as String#match or Regexp#match. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize user-controlled input to prevent any potential attacks. For example, the code could use a library like Rack::Attack to validate and sanitize user input.  The code should also consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input, where only expected input is allowed.  This will help prevent any potential attacks.  The
