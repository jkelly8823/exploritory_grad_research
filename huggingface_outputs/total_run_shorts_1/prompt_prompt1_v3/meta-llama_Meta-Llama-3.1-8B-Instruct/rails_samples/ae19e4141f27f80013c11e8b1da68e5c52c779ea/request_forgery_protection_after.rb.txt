VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks. This is because the `verified_request?` method does not properly validate the authenticity token in the request.
EXPLANATION: The `verified_request?` method checks if the request is a GET request, or if the form authenticity token matches the token value from the params or the X-CSRF-Token header. However, it does not check if the token value from the params is actually set. This allows an attacker to bypass the CSRF protection by not including the token value in the request.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the token value from the params is set before comparing it to the form authenticity token. You can do this by adding a simple `if` statement to check if `params[request_forgery_protection_token]` is set before the comparison. For example: `if params[request_forgery_protection_token].present? && form_authenticity_token == params[request_forgery_protection_token]`. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure method to generate and store the authenticity token
