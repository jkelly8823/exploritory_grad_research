VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The deprecate method is used incorrectly. The deprecate method is used to warn about the deprecation of a method, but it is not used to update the code. The deprecate method should be used to warn about the deprecation of a method, and the method should be updated or removed.
EXPLANATION: The deprecate method is used to warn about the deprecation of a method, but it is not used to update the code. The deprecate method should be used to warn about the deprecation of a method, and the method should be updated or removed. In this case, the deprecate method is used to warn about the deprecation of the forgery_whitelisted? method, but the method is not updated or removed. This can cause confusion and errors in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The deprecate method should be used to warn about the deprecation of the forgery_whitelisted? method, and the method should be updated or removed. The updated code should be:
    def forgery_whitelisted?
      get?
    end

    # The forgery_whitelisted
