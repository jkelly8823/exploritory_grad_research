VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack. This is because the `protect_from_forgery` method is not properly configured to protect against CSRF attacks.
EXPLANATION: The `protect_from_forgery` method is not properly configured to protect against CSRF attacks because the `request_forgery_protection_token` is set to `:authenticity_token` by default. However, the `request_forgery_protection_token` should be set to a unique token for each request. Additionally, the `verify_authenticity_token` method is not properly configured to handle unverified requests.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should set the `request_forgery_protection_token` to a unique token for each request. You can do this by using the `protect_from_forgery` method with the `:except` option to specify the actions that should not be protected. For example: `protect_from_forgery :except => [:index]`. Additionally, you should modify the `verify_authenticity_token` method to handle unverified requests properly. You can do this by
