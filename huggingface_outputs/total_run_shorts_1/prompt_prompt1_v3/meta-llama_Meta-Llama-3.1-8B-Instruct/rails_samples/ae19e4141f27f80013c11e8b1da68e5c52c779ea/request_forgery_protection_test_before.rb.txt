VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The controller class FreeCookieController has disabled request forgery protection by setting allow_forgery_protection to false. This makes the controller vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
EXPLANATION: The allow_forgery_protection attribute is used to enable or disable request forgery protection for a controller. By setting it to false, the controller is no longer protected against CSRF attacks. This can allow an attacker to send a malicious request to the controller, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data modifications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, set allow_forgery_protection to true in the FreeCookieController class. This will enable request forgery protection and prevent CSRF attacks. Additionally, consider using a secure token or other authentication mechanism to further protect the controller from unauthorized access.
