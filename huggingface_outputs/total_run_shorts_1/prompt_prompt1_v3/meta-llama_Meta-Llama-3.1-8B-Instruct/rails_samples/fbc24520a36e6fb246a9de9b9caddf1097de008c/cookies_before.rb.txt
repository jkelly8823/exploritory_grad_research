VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the DOMAIN_REGEXP regular expression. This regular expression can be exploited to cause a denial of service by providing a malicious input that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression DOMAIN_REGEXP contains a pattern that can be exploited to cause a denial of service. The pattern `[^.]*\.([^.]*|..\...|...\...)$` can be matched by a string that contains a large number of subdomains, causing the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to prevent it from consuming excessive resources. One possible solution is to use a more efficient regular expression pattern, such as `/\.[^.]+$/`, which matches the top-level domain without consuming excessive resources. Additionally, the regular expression should be validated to ensure that it does not match any malicious input. The code should also be updated to handle the case where the input is too large to match the regular expression, to prevent a denial of service attack
