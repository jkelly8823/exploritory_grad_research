VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to cookie domain hijacking. This is because the code sets the domain of the cookie to the root domain of the website, which can be exploited by an attacker to steal the cookie.
EXPLANATION: The code sets the domain of the cookie to the root domain of the website using the `domain: :all` option. This allows an attacker to steal the cookie by setting a CNAME record for the subdomain to point to their own domain. The attacker can then access the cookie by visiting the subdomain.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should set the domain of the cookie to the subdomain instead of the root domain. This can be done by setting the `domain` option to the subdomain instead of `:all`. Additionally, the code should validate the `tld_length` option to ensure it is not set to a value that is too long. This can be done by checking if the `tld_length` is greater than the actual TLD length of the domain. If it is, the code should raise an error or log a warning. 

Note: The code also has a vulnerability
