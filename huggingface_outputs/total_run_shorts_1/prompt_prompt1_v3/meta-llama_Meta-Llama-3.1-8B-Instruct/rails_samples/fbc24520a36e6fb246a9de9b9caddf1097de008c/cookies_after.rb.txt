VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential cookie domain spoofing attack. This is because the code does not properly validate the domain of the request, allowing an attacker to potentially set cookies for a different domain.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to determine the domain of the request based on the host header. However, it does not properly handle cases where the host header is an IP address or an invalid domain. Additionally, the code does not validate the domain against a list of known domains, making it vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the domain of the request. This can be done by checking if the host header is an IP address or an invalid domain, and if so, setting the domain to nil. Additionally, the code should be modified to validate the domain against a list of known domains. This can be done by using a library such as Rack::Attack to validate the domain. The code should also be modified to handle cases where the tld_length is not provided, and to properly handle cases where the host header is a domain with a TLD like co.uk
