 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to cookie tampering due to the use of the `domain: :all` option in the `delete_cookie_with_domain_and_tld` method. This option allows the cookie to be deleted from any domain, which can be exploited by an attacker to delete cookies from other domains.
EXPLANATION: The `domain: :all` option is used to delete cookies from all domains, including subdomains. This can be a security risk if the cookie is intended to be deleted from a specific domain only. An attacker can exploit this by setting a cookie with the same name on a different domain, and then deleting it using the `delete_cookie_with_domain_and_tld` method. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as deleting cookies from other domains or sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `domain: :all` option should be removed from the `delete_cookie_with_domain_and_tld` method. Instead, the method should delete the cookie from the specific domain it was set on. Additionally, the `tld_length: 2` option should be removed, as it is not necessary and can also be exploited
