VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `get` method directly calls `@app.call` with a path that is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `get` method takes a path as an argument and passes it directly to `@app.call` without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious paths, leading to a path traversal attack. For example, if the path is `/../../../../etc/passwd`, the attacker could potentially access sensitive files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `get` method should be modified to properly sanitize the path before passing it to `@app.call`. This can be done by using a library such as `uri` to parse the path and ensure it does not contain any malicious characters. Additionally, the `get` method should be modified to handle errors and exceptions properly to prevent further attacks. For example, the method could be modified to raise an exception if the path is not properly sanitized. ```ruby
    def get(path)
      begin
        sanitized_path = URI.parse(path).path
        @app.call
