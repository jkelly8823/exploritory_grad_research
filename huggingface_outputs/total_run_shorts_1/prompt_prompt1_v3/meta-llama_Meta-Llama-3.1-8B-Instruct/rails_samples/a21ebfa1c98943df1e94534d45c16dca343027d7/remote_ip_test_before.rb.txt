 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential information disclosure due to the use of a hardcoded secret key in the key generator.
EXPLANATION: The hardcoded secret key "b3c631c314c0bbca50c1b2843150fe33" is used to initialize the key generator. This key should be kept secret and not hardcoded in the code. Hardcoding a secret key makes it easier for an attacker to obtain the key and use it to access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The secret key should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secrets manager. The key generator should be initialized with a secure key that is not hardcoded in the code. For example, you can use a secrets manager like Hashicorp's Vault to store and retrieve the secret key. Additionally, consider using a secure random number generator to generate the key instead of hardcoding it.  ```ruby
# Using a secrets manager
ActiveSupport::CachingKeyGenerator.new(
  ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(ENV['SECRET_KEY'], iterations: 1000)
)
```  ```ruby
# Using a secure random number generator
