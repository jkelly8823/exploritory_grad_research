 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Host Header Injection attack. This is because the code does not properly validate the HTTP_HOST header, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary hostnames.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a regular expression to match the HTTP_HOST header, but it does not account for the possibility of an attacker injecting a malicious hostname. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or access unauthorized resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to validate the HTTP_HOST header, such as using a whitelist of allowed hostnames or using a library that provides secure hostname validation. Additionally, the code should be updated to properly handle the case where the HTTP_HOST header is not present. This could involve using a default hostname or throwing an error if the header is missing.
