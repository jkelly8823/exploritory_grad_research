 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Host Header Injection attack. This is because the code does not properly sanitize the 'HOST' header in the request.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the 'HOST' header in the request to determine the host to block. However, the 'HOST' header can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious hostnames. This can lead to a Host Header Injection attack, where the attacker can trick the application into blocking or allowing requests to arbitrary hosts.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the 'HOST' header in the request. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed hostnames or by using a library that can safely parse and validate the 'HOST' header. Additionally, the code should avoid using the 'HOST' header directly and instead use a more secure method to determine the host to block. For example, the code could use the 'Host' header from the request object, which is less susceptible to manipulation by an attacker.
