 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential information disclosure due to the use of a hardcoded secret key in the key generator.
EXPLANATION: The hardcoded secret key "b3c631c314c0bbca50c1b2843150fe33" is used to generate keys for the caching key generator. This key should be kept secret to prevent unauthorized access to the application. However, by hardcoding it in the code, it is exposed and can be easily accessed by an attacker. This can lead to information disclosure and potential security breaches.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The secret key should be stored securely, such as in environment variables or a secrets manager, and not hardcoded in the code. The key generator should be configured to use the stored secret key instead of the hardcoded one. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as key rotation and revocation, to further protect the application.  ```ruby
