VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential path traversal attack. This is because the `get` method directly calls the `@app` object with a user-provided path, which can be manipulated to access arbitrary files on the server.
EXPLANATION: The `get` method takes a path as an argument and uses it to call the `@app` object with a Rack::MockRequest. However, the `env_for` method of Rack::MockRequest does not perform any validation on the path, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory. This can lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker can access sensitive files on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `get` method should validate the path before passing it to the `@app` object. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed paths or by using a library that performs path validation. Additionally, the `env_for` method of Rack::MockRequest should be used with caution and its behavior should be thoroughly understood. It may be necessary to use a different method to create a mock request that does not allow path
