 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Host Header Injection attack. This is because the `request.get_header("HTTP_HOST")` method is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary hostnames.
EXPLANATION: The `request.get_header("HTTP_HOST")` method is used to retrieve the hostname from the HTTP request. However, this method does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input. An attacker can exploit this by injecting a malicious hostname, potentially leading to a Host Header Injection attack. This can be used to bypass security measures, steal sensitive information, or even take control of the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more secure method to retrieve the hostname, such as `request.host` or `request.headers["Host"]`. Additionally, you should validate and sanitize the input to prevent any malicious hostnames from being injected. You can use a regular expression to validate the hostname and ensure it matches the expected format. For example: `request.get_header("HTTP_HOST")&.match(HOSTNAME)`. This will prevent any malicious hostnames from being injected and reduce the risk of a Host Header Injection attack
