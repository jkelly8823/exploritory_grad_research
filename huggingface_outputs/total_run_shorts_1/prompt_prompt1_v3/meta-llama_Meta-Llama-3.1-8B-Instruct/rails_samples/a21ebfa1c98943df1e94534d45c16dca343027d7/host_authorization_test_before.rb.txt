 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential DNS rebinding attack. This is because the code does not properly validate the hostname before making a request to it. This could allow an attacker to make requests to internal hosts by manipulating the hostname.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `HOST` environment variable to determine the hostname of the request. However, this variable can be manipulated by an attacker to make requests to internal hosts. The code does not properly validate the hostname before making a request to it, which makes it vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the hostname before making a request to it. This can be done by using a library such as `uri` to parse the hostname and check if it is a valid hostname. Additionally, the code should not use the `HOST` environment variable to determine the hostname, but instead use a more secure method such as the `request.host` attribute. 

Note: The code is also using the `assert_deprecated` method, which is deprecated and should be removed. However, this is not a security vulnerability and is only a coding standard issue
