VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This occurs when a regular expression is crafted to cause the engine to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. This is because the regular expression contains a possessive quantifier (`*+`) which can cause the engine to consume excessive resources when matching certain inputs. The regular expression `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` is used to match a semicolon followed by an optional q parameter. However, the regular expression does not properly handle cases where the q parameter is not present, leading to a potential ReDoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` should be modified to properly handle cases where the q parameter is not present. This can be done by changing the regular expression to `/\s*;\s*q="?0"?/`. This change ensures that the regular expression does not consume excessive resources when matching certain inputs. Additionally, it is recommended to use a more robust regular expression engine,
