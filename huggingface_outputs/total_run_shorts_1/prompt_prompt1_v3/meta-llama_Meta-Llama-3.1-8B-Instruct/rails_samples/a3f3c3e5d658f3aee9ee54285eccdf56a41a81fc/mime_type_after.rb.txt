VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This occurs when a regular expression is crafted to cause the engine to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. This is because the regular expression contains a possessive quantifier (`*+`) which can cause the engine to consume excessive resources when matching certain inputs. The regular expression `ACCEPT_HEADER_REGEXP` is also vulnerable to a ReDoS attack for the same reason.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expressions should be rewritten to avoid possessive quantifiers. For example, the regular expression `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` could be rewritten as `/;\s*q="?/`, and the regular expression `ACCEPT_HEADER_REGEXP` could be rewritten as `/[^,\s"](?:[^,"]|"[^"]*")*/`. Additionally, consider using a more robust regular expression engine, such as the `oniguruma` engine, which is designed to handle large inputs more efficiently.  Also, consider using a more
