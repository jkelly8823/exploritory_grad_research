VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where options.data is not a string, but is instead an object. This could lead to a potential vulnerability if the object contains sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the code checks if options.data is a string, but does not account for the possibility that it could be an object. If options.data is an object, the code will still attempt to set the Content-Type header to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8', which could potentially expose sensitive information if the object contains it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to check if options.data is an object, and if so, set the Content-Type header to'multipart/form-data' instead. This would ensure that sensitive information is properly protected. For example: if typeof options.data is 'object' then xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type','multipart/form-data') else xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8') .
