VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to XXE attacks because it does not properly sanitize user input when parsing XML. In the test methods, the code is using the `Hash.from_xml` method to parse XML, which can lead to XXE attacks if the input XML contains malicious entities. Specifically, the `test_not_allowed_to_expand_entities_to_files` and `test_not_allowed_to_expand_parameter_entities_to_files` methods are vulnerable because they do not check if the input XML contains any malicious entities before parsing it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to parse XML, such as `Nokogiri::XML` or `Rexml::Document`. Additionally, the code should validate the input XML to ensure it does not contain any malicious entities. This can be done by using a library such as `libxml2` or `xmlsec`. Finally, the code should also consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific XML elements and attributes to be parsed. This will help prevent XXE attacks and ensure the code is more secure.
