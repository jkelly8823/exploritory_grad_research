VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the 'data' variable, which is used to construct an XML document.
EXPLANATION: The 'data' variable is not validated or sanitized before being used to construct an XML document. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code, potentially leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. The'merge_element!' method is called with a hash containing the 'CONTENT_KEY' key, which is then used to set the text content of an XML element. If the 'data' variable contains malicious XML code, it could be used to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'data' variable should be validated and sanitized before being used to construct the XML document. This can be achieved by using a library such as 'xmlsec' to parse and validate the XML data. Additionally, the'merge_element!' method should be modified to use a parameterized query or a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks. The 'CONTENT_KEY' key should also be validated and sanitized to prevent any malicious code from being injected. 

Note: The 'CONTENT_KEY
