VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle cases where the input string contains a hyphen (-) followed by an uppercase letter. This can lead to incorrect results when converting the string to camel case.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression /[A-Z-]|::/.match?(camel_cased_word) does not account for the case where the input string contains a hyphen followed by an uppercase letter. This can cause the function to incorrectly identify the string as not being camel case, resulting in the string being returned as is without any modifications.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the regular expression should be updated to account for the case where the input string contains a hyphen followed by an uppercase letter. This can be done by adding a negative lookahead assertion to the regular expression to ensure that the hyphen is not followed by an uppercase letter. For example: /[A-Z-](?![A-Z])|::/.match?(camel_cased_word) This will correctly identify the string as camel case and apply the necessary modifications. Alternatively, the function could be modified to handle the hyphen case separately, for example by checking for it explicitly before applying the regular
