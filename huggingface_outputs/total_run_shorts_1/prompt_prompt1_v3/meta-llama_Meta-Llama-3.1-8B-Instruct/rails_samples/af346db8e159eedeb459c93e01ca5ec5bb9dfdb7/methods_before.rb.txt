VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle cases where the input string contains a hyphen (-) or double colon (::) followed by a letter. This can lead to incorrect results when converting the string to camel case.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression /[A-Z-]|::/.match?(camel_cased_word) is used to check if the input string contains a hyphen or double colon followed by a letter. However, this regular expression does not account for cases where the hyphen or double colon is at the end of the string. For example, if the input string is "hello-world", the regular expression will not match and the function will return the original string. This can lead to incorrect results when converting the string to camel case.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be modified to account for cases where the hyphen or double colon is at the end of the string. For example, the regular expression could be changed to /[A-Z-]|::(?=[A-Z])/. This will ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the input string contains a hyphen or double colon followed by a letter. Additionally, the
