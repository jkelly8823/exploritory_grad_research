VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Host Header Attack. This is because it directly compares the host from the URL with the request host. An attacker could manipulate the host header to bypass this check.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to validate the URL host by comparing it with the request host. However, this comparison is done directly without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could manipulate the host header to bypass this check. For example, if the request host is "example.com", an attacker could send a request with a host header of "example.com/subdirectory" and the code would incorrectly validate it.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the host header by comparing it with the request host after sanitizing the host header to remove any subdirectories. This can be done by using the `URI` class to parse the URL and then comparing the host with the request host. Additionally, the code should handle cases where the host header is not present or is empty. The updated code should look like this:

def _url_host_allowed?(url)
  begin
    host = URI(url.to_s).host
    return true if
