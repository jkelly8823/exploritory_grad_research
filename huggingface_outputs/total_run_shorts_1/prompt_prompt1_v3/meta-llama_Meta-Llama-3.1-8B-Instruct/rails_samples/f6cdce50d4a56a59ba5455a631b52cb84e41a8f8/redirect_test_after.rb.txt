VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains several instances of unsafe redirects, which can be exploited by attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.
EXPLANATION: The code uses several methods that redirect to URLs without proper validation, including `redirect_to` with protocol-relative URLs, `redirect_to` with URLs containing double or triple slashes, and `redirect_to` with URLs that are not fully qualified. These types of redirects can be exploited by attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use `redirect_to` with fully qualified URLs, and to validate the URLs before redirecting. Additionally, the `allow_other_host` parameter should be set to `true` when redirecting to a URL that is not fully qualified. For example, instead of using `redirect_to "http:///www.rubyonrails.org/"`, use `redirect_to "http://www.rubyonrails.org/"`. Similarly, instead of using `redirect_to "//www.rubyonrails.org/"`, use `redirect_to "http://www.rubyonrails.org/"`. The `only_path_redirect` method should also be modified to use `
