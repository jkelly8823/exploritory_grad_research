 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a regular expression in the `url.to_s.start_with?("/")` method. This can lead to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `url.to_s.start_with?("/")` method uses a regular expression under the hood, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking if the input is crafted in a specific way. This can cause the method to consume excessive CPU resources and potentially lead to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can replace the `url.to_s.start_with?("/")` method with a simple string comparison using the `start_with?` method, like this: `url.to_s.start_with?("/")`. This will prevent the use of a regular expression and mitigate the risk of catastrophic backtracking. Additionally, you can consider using a more robust URL parsing library, such as `uriex`, which can handle malformed URLs more efficiently.  ```ruby
      def _url_host_allowed?(url)
        host = URI(url.to_s).host
        host == request.host || host.nil?
