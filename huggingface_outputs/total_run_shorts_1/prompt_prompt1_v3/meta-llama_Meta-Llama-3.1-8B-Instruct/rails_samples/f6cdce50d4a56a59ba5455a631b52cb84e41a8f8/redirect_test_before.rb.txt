 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains two instances of vulnerable redirects. The first instance is a redirect to an external URL without the `only_path: true` option, which can lead to an open redirect vulnerability. The second instance is a redirect to a URL with a protocol-relative path, which can also lead to an open redirect vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The first instance of vulnerable code is located in the `redirect_back_or_to` method. This method is used to redirect the user back to the previous page or to a specified URL. However, in this case, it is redirecting to an external URL without the `only_path: true` option. This means that the URL will be fully qualified, including the protocol (http or https), which can lead to an open redirect vulnerability. An attacker could potentially trick the user into visiting a malicious website by manipulating the URL.

The second instance of vulnerable code is located in the `redirect_to` method with a protocol-relative path. This type of path is denoted by a double forward slash (//) at the beginning of the URL. This can also lead to an open redirect vulnerability because an attacker could manipulate
