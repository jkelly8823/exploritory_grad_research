VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string concatenation in the `send(name + "=", value)` line. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `name` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `send` method is used to dynamically call a method on an object. In this case, the method name is constructed by concatenating the `name` variable with an equals sign. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by manipulating the `name` variable. For example, if the `name` variable is set to `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{id}"`, the `send` method will execute the SQL query, potentially leading to a SQL injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. One possible solution is to use the `send(name + "=", value)` line only when the `name` variable is a valid method name, and raise an error otherwise. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the `name` variable and ensure it only contains valid method names.
