VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. The `raw` method is used to prevent HTML escaping, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
EXPLANATION: The `raw` method is used to prevent HTML escaping, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This is a potential security risk, as an attacker could inject JavaScript code that could be executed by the browser, potentially leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `sanitize` method instead of `raw` to prevent XSS attacks. The `sanitize` method will remove any malicious code from the input, preventing an attacker from injecting malicious JavaScript code. For example, you can replace `raw(paragraph)` with `sanitize(paragraph)`. Additionally, you should ensure that any user-input data is properly sanitized before rendering it in the view. This can be achieved by using the `sanitize` method on any user-input data before passing it to the view.  You can also use the `strip_tags` method to remove any HTML tags from the input, but this may not be
