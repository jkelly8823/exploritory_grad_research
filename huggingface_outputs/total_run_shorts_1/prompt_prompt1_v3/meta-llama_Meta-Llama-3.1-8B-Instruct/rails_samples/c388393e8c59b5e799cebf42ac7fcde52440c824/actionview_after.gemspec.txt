VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a Gemfile, which is a common file used in Ruby projects to specify dependencies. However, there is a potential issue with the version specification for the "rails-html-sanitizer" gem. The version constraint "~> 1.0, >= 1.0.3" is not a valid version constraint. The "~>" operator is used to specify a version range, but it cannot be combined with the ">=" operator. This could potentially lead to issues with the gem version being installed.
EXPLANATION: 
The "~>" operator is used to specify a version range, but it cannot be combined with the ">=" operator. The correct way to specify a version range with a minimum version is to use the ">=" operator alone. For example, "~> 1.0, >= 1.0.3" should be changed to ">=" 1.0.3".
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Change the version constraint for the "rails-html-sanitizer" gem to ">=" 1.0.3". This will ensure that the correct version of the gem is installed. The corrected line should look like
