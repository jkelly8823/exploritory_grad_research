VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `select` method on the `v` variable without proper validation. This could lead to an attacker manipulating the `v` variable to inject malicious data.
EXPLANATION: The `select` method is used to filter the `v` variable based on certain conditions. However, the conditions used in the `select` method (`format.symbol || format.ref == "*/*"`) do not properly validate the input. An attacker could manipulate the `v` variable to inject malicious data, potentially leading to a security issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the input before using the `select` method. This can be achieved by using a more robust validation mechanism, such as using a whitelist of allowed formats or using a library that provides secure filtering. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all variables are properly sanitized before being used in the `select` method.  The `set_header` method should also be reviewed to ensure it is not vulnerable to similar issues.  The `k` variable should be validated to ensure
