VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a MIME Sniffing attack. MIME Sniffing is a technique used by attackers to bypass the Content-Type header of a response and force the client to interpret the response as a different type than what the server intended.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `respond_to` method to handle different types of requests. However, it does not properly handle the case where the client sends a `Content-Type` header that is not one of the registered types. In this case, the server will render the "Nothing" template, which could potentially be interpreted by the client as a different type of content. This allows an attacker to bypass the Content-Type header and force the client to interpret the response as a different type.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle unknown `Content-Type` headers. This can be done by adding a check for the `Content-Type` header in the `respond_to` block and rendering a specific template for unknown types. For example: `type.unknown { render body: "Unknown type" }`. Additionally, the server should be configured to send a `Content-Type
