VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a MIME Sniffing attack. This is because the code does not properly handle the Accept header, allowing an attacker to manipulate the response content type.
EXPLANATION: MIME Sniffing is a type of attack where an attacker manipulates the Accept header to force the server to return a response with a different content type than intended. In this case, the code checks the Accept header and returns a response with a content type based on the value. However, it does not properly validate the Accept header, allowing an attacker to manipulate the response content type. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate the Accept header to ensure it only accepts valid MIME types. This can be done by using a whitelist of accepted MIME types and checking the Accept header against this list. Additionally, the code should use the `Mime::Type.lookup` method to determine the content type of the response, rather than relying on the Accept header. This will ensure that the response content type is always correct, even if the Accept header is manipulated by an attacker. For example: `
