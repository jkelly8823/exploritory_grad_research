VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security issue due to the use of the `assert_body` method without proper validation of the response body. This could lead to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the response body is not sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_body` method is used to verify that the response body contains a certain string. However, if the response body is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the response body, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This is particularly concerning in the second test case where the `xhr` option is set to `true`, as this could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the response body.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize the response body before asserting its contents. This can be done by using a library such as `sanitize` to remove any malicious code from the response body. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all response bodies are properly sanitized before being asserted. It is also recommended to use a more secure method of asserting the response body, such as using a regular expression to match the
