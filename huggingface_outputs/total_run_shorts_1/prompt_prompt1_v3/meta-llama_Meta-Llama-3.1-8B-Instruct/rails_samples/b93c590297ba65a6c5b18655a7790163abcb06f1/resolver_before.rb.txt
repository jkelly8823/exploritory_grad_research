 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. This is because the `Dir[]` method is used with a user-controlled string (`query`) that is not sanitized. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `query` string to traverse the file system and access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The `Dir[]` method is used to list files in a directory. However, when used with a string that is not sanitized, it can be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. In this case, the `query` string is constructed by joining a list of strings with commas, which allows an attacker to inject malicious directory paths. For example, if the `ext` array contains the string `"../"`, the `query` string would be `"./../"`, which would list files in the parent directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `query` string should be sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be done by using a library like `Pathname` to normalize the directory path and prevent traversal. Alternatively, the `Dir[]` method can be replaced with a safer alternative, such as `Dir.glob`
