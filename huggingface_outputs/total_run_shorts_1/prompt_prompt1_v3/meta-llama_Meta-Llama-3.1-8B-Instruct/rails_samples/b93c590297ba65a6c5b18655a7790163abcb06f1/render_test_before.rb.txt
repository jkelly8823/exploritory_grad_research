VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of the `render` method with a string parameter that is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `render` method is used to render a template, but in this case, it is being used with a string parameter `"hello_world"`. This string parameter is not properly sanitized, which means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the template. This could lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `render` method with a symbol parameter instead of a string parameter. The symbol parameter should be a constant or a variable that is properly sanitized. For example: `render :action => :hello_world`. Additionally, the code should use a template engine that supports sanitization, such as ERb or Haml. The `assert_template` method should also be used with caution, as it may not catch all potential XSS attacks. A more robust solution would be to use a testing framework that supports sanitization, such as RSpec.  The `@response.body`
