VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a string comparison in the assertion.
EXPLANATION: The `assert_equal` method is used to compare the response body with the expected string. However, this comparison is done using a string equality check, which can be vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker could potentially manipulate the response body to be slightly different from the expected string, causing the assertion to fail or pass based on the timing of the comparison.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a constant-time string comparison method, such as `String#==?` with the `:case_sensitive` option set to `false`, or a library like `safe_compare`. This will ensure that the comparison is done in a way that is not vulnerable to timing attacks. Additionally, consider using a more robust assertion method, such as `assert_match`, which can help prevent timing attacks. ```ruby
assert_match /HTTP Token: Access denied\./, @response.body, "Authentication header was not properly parsed"
``` ```ruby
