VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential infinite recursion bug due to the use of the extend self method in the module Token. This can lead to a stack overflow error if the module is extended multiple times.
EXPLANATION: The extend self method is used to add methods to the current class. However, in this case, it is being used in a module, which can lead to unexpected behavior. If the module is extended multiple times, it can cause the methods to be added multiple times, leading to a potential infinite recursion bug.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, the extend self method should be removed and the methods should be added to the module using the module's class methods. For example, the method authenticate_or_request_with_http_token should be added to the module using the class method def self.authenticate_or_request_with_http_token. This will prevent the potential infinite recursion bug. Additionally, it is recommended to use a more robust method for adding methods to the module, such as using a mixin or a class that includes the module. This will help to prevent unexpected behavior and make the code more maintainable.  ```ruby
def self.authenticate_or_request
