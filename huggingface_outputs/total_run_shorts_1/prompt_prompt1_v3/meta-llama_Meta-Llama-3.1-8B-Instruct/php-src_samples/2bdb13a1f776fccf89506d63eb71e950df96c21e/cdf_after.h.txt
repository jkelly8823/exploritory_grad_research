 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a set of macro definitions for a C-like language. It defines several constants and enumerations for use in a larger program. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). The use of macro definitions is a common practice in C and C-like languages, and in this case, it does not appear to introduce any security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure and does not require any changes to address security vulnerabilities. However, it is always a good practice to review and test code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce any unexpected behavior.  Please note that this code snippet is a set of macro definitions and does not contain any executable code. Therefore, it is not possible to test it directly.  It is assumed that this code snippet will be used in a larger program that will be tested and reviewed separately.  If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.  I will be happy to help
