VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A command injection vulnerability is present due to the use of user-controlled input in the ADD_SOURCES function.
EXPLANATION: The ADD_SOURCES function is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates user-controlled input (configure_module_dirname) with a string that is used as a command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the configure_module_dirname variable.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the ADD_SOURCES function should be modified to use a safe method of concatenating strings, such as using a library function that escapes special characters. Additionally, the configure_module_dirname variable should be validated to ensure it only contains allowed characters. The ADD_FLAG function should also be modified to use a safe method of concatenating strings. The "/I " + configure_module_dirname part of the command should be validated to ensure it only contains allowed characters.  The use of user-controlled input in the ADD_SOURCES and ADD_FLAG functions should be avoided by using a whitelist of allowed values for the configure_module_dirname variable.  The configure_module_dirname variable should be validated to ensure it only contains allowed characters.  The use of user-controlled
