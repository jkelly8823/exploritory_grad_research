VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  There are no obvious vulnerabilities in this code snippet. However, it is worth noting that the use of string concatenation with the "+" operator may lead to potential issues if the variables being concatenated are not properly sanitized. It is also worth noting that the use of environment variables (e.g. configure_module_dirname) without proper validation may lead to potential security issues. To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to use a secure method of string concatenation, such as using a template engine or a secure string formatting library. Additionally, it is recommended to validate and sanitize any environment variables before using them in the code.
