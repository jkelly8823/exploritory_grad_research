VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code. The strncpy function is used to copy a string into the buffer 'hash', but the buffer is not checked for sufficient size before copying. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string being copied is longer than the buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using the strncpy function to copy a string into the buffer 'hash'. However, the buffer 'hash' is not checked for sufficient size before copying. The strncpy function will stop copying when it reaches the null character, but it will not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the string being copied is longer than the buffer. In this case, the buffer 'hash' is allocated with a size of (hash_len+1)*sizeof(char), but the strncpy function is copying a string of size hash_len. This means that the buffer 'hash' is not large enough to hold the string being copied, and a buffer overflow will occur.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should
