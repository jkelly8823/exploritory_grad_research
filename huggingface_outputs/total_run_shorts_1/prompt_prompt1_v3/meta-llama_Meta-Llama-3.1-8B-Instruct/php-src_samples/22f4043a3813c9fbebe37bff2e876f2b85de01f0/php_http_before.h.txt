VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger C codebase, possibly a PHP extension. It defines two function prototypes for authentication methods and a macro definition. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS). However, it's worth noting that the use of the TSRMLS_DC macro suggests that this code is using the Zend Engine, which has been deprecated since PHP 7.2. This may indicate that the code is outdated and in need of review.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Review the code for any potential security vulnerabilities that may have been introduced in the Zend Engine.
2. Consider updating the code to use a more modern PHP extension or framework.
3. Ensure that the TSRMLS_DC macro is used correctly and is not a source of any issues.  ```bash
