 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a notice error due to passing an array to the fputcsv function.
EXPLANATION: The fputcsv function expects a list of strings, but the code is passing an array containing a mix of types, including an array. This will cause a notice error when the function tries to convert the array to a string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that all elements in the $data array are strings before passing it to the fputcsv function. This can be done by using the array_map function to convert the array to a list of strings. For example: $data = array_map('strval', $data);. Alternatively, the code can use the fputcsv function's ability to handle arrays by passing the array as a single element, like this: $fo->fputcsv(array($data));. However, this approach may not be suitable for all use cases, as it will output the array as a single string, rather than as individual elements.  Also, the code should check the type of each element in the array before passing it to the fputcsv function
