VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of memmove without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The memmove function is used to copy data from one location to another. However, it does not perform bounds checking, which means that if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the data being copied, it will overflow and potentially cause a security vulnerability. In this code snippet, memmove is used to copy data into client->request.content and client->current_header_name without checking if the destination buffer has enough space. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the data being copied is larger than the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a safer function like memcpy or strcpy, which perform bounds checking. Alternatively, use a function that allocates memory dynamically, such as pemalloc, to ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. Additionally, consider using a library that provides bounds checking for memory operations, such as AddressSanitizer. It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice, such as using a fixed-size buffer and checking
