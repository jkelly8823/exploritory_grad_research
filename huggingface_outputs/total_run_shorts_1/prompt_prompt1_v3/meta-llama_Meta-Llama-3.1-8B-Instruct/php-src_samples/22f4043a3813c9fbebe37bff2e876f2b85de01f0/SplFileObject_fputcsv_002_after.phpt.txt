VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a notice error due to passing an array to the fputcsv function which expects a string.
EXPLANATION: The fputcsv function expects a string as its second argument, but an array is being passed. This will result in a notice error when the function is called.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The array should be converted to a string before being passed to the fputcsv function. This can be done using the implode function. For example: $fo->fputcsv(array_map('strval', $data));. Alternatively, the array can be converted to a string using the json_encode function: $fo->fputcsv(json_encode($data));. However, this will result in a string that is not a valid CSV. The implode function is the recommended solution.
