VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential file inclusion vulnerability due to the use of a user-controlled filename in the SplFileObject constructor.
EXPLANATION: The SplFileObject constructor is being passed a filename that is not validated or sanitized. This could potentially allow an attacker to include arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the filename. However, in this specific case, the filename is hardcoded and does not pose an immediate risk. Nevertheless, it is still a vulnerability that should be addressed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the filename should be validated and sanitized before being passed to the SplFileObject constructor. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed filenames or by using a function like realpath() to ensure the filename is an absolute path. Additionally, it would be a good practice to use a constant or a configuration variable for the filename instead of hardcoding it. This would make it easier to change the filename in the future if needed.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that any user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential security risks.  It is also recommended to use a more secure way to handle file operations, such as
