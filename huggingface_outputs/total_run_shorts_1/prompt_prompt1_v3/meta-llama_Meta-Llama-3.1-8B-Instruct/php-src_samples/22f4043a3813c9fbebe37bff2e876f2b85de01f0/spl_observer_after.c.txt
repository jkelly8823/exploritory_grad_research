VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code. The memcpy function is used to copy a variable number of bytes from the source to the destination. However, the destination buffer size is not checked, and the hash_len variable is used as the size of the destination buffer. If hash_len is larger than the actual size of the destination buffer, a buffer overflow will occur.
EXPLANATION: The memcpy function is used to copy data from the source to the destination. The size of the destination buffer is specified by the hash_len variable. However, the hash_len variable is not checked to ensure it is within the bounds of the destination buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if hash_len is larger than the actual size of the destination buffer. In this case, the destination buffer is a char array of size hash_len + 1, which is allocated using emalloc. However, the memcpy function will copy hash_len bytes from the source to the destination, but the destination buffer is not checked to ensure it has enough space to hold the copied data.
