VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (path_translated) to store a dynamically-sized string (path_translated_len).
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to calculate the length of the PATH_TRANSLATED string by subtracting the length of the SCRIPT_NAME from the length of the PATH_TRANSLATED string. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of a buffer overflow, where the PATH_TRANSLATED string is longer than the allocated buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a dynamically-sized buffer to store the PATH_TRANSLATED string, or use a safer function such as strcpy_s or strncpy to copy the string into the buffer. Additionally, the code should check the length of the PATH_TRANSLATED string before allocating the buffer to ensure that it does not overflow. The corrected code should look like this: char *path_translated = emalloc(strlen(pt) + 1); memcpy(path_translated, pt, strlen(pt));. 

Note: The emalloc function is assumed to be
