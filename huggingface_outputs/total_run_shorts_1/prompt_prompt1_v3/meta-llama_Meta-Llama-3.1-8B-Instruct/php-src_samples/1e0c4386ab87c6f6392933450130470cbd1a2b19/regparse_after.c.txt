VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `BITSET_SET_BIT` without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `BITSET_SET_BIT` function is used to set a bit in a bitset without checking if the index is within the bounds of the bitset. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the index is larger than the size of the bitset.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the bitset before calling `BITSET_SET_BIT`. This can be done by checking if the index is less than the size of the bitset before setting the bit. For example: `if (index < BITSET_SIZE(cc->bs)) BITSET_SET_BIT(cc->bs, index);`. Additionally, consider using a safer function that checks bounds automatically, such as `BITSET_SET_BIT_SAFE`.  VULNERABLE: YES
