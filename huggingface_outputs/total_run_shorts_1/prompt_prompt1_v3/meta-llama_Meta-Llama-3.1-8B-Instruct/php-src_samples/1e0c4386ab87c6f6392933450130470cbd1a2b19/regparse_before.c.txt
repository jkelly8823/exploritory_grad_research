VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `BITSET_SET_BIT` without bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The `BITSET_SET_BIT` function does not perform any bounds checking on the index being set. If the index is out of range, it could potentially lead to a buffer overflow. This is a concern because the `BITSET_SET_BIT` function is used to set a bit in a bitset, and if the index is out of range, it could overwrite adjacent bits or even the bitset's metadata.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that the index being set is within the valid range of the bitset. This can be done by checking if the index is less than the size of the bitset before calling `BITSET_SET_BIT`. For example: `if (index < cc->bs.size) BITSET_SET_BIT(cc->bs, index);`. Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to `BITSET_SET_BIT`, such as `bitset_set` from the `bitset` library, which performs bounds checking internally.  VULNERABLE: YES
