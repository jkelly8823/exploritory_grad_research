VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the gethostbyname function, which is deprecated and can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving hostnames.
EXPLANATION: The gethostbyname function is deprecated and can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving hostnames. This function is vulnerable to CVE-2015-0235, which allows an attacker to overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code. The code checks for hostname length, but it does not prevent the buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the gethostbyname function with a safer alternative, such as getaddrinfo or getnameinfo. These functions are more secure and do not have the same buffer overflow vulnerability. Additionally, consider using a hostname validation library to prevent hostname length attacks.  Also, consider using a secure way to handle the hostname, such as using a library that can handle long hostnames.  It is also recommended to use a secure way to handle the error, such as using a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur.  Finally, consider using a secure way to handle the return value, such as using a
