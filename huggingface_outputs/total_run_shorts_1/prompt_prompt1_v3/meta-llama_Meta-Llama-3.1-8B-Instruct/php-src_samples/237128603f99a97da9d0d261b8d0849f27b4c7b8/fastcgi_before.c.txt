VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of gethostbyname() which is deprecated and can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving hostnames.
EXPLANATION: The gethostbyname() function is deprecated and has been removed in modern systems. It is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. The function can return a pointer to a static buffer which can be overwritten by an attacker. This can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving hostnames. The use of this function is not recommended and should be replaced with a safer alternative such as getaddrinfo().
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace gethostbyname() with getaddrinfo() and use the returned address family and address to resolve the hostname. Also, check for errors when calling getaddrinfo() to handle any potential issues. For example: int status = getaddrinfo(host, NULL, NULL, &hints); if (status!= 0) { // handle error } else { // use the returned address family and address } ```c
