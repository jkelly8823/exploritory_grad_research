VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack. This is because the code does not properly validate the hostname before passing it to the gethostbyname function. An attacker could potentially exploit this by passing a hostname that resolves to an IP address that is not the intended target, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable because it does not check if the hostname is valid before passing it to the gethostbyname function. This allows an attacker to potentially pass a hostname that resolves to an IP address that is not the intended target, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions. The gethostbyname function can return a pointer to a hostent structure, which contains information about the hostname. However, if the hostname is not valid, the function will return NULL, and the code will not handle this case properly. This is a classic example of a DNS rebinding attack, where an attacker can trick the code into connecting to a different IP address than intended.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the hostname before passing it to the get
