VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of `strchr` to check for the presence of a '=' character in the query string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the query string contains a large number of '=' characters.
EXPLANATION: The `strchr` function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the '=' character in the query string. However, if the query string contains a large number of '=' characters, the function will return a pointer to the last '=' character, which can lead to a buffer overflow when the decoded query string is allocated using `strdup`. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function such as `strpbrk` to check for the presence of a '=' character in the query string. Additionally, the code should use a fixed-size buffer to store the decoded query string, and check for buffer overflows before allocating memory. The code should also consider using a more secure function such as `getopt_long` to parse the command line options.
