VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The buffer 'arg' is declared with a fixed size of 11, but the code does not check the length of the input before copying it into the buffer. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two potential vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is in the ftp_get function, where the 'arg' buffer is declared with a fixed size of 11. However, the code does not check the length of the input before copying it into the buffer. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. The second vulnerability is in the ftp_getresp function, where the 'buf' pointer is not checked for null before being dereferenced. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix the first vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input before copying it into the buffer. This can be done by using the strlcpy function, which copies a string into a buffer while preventing buffer overflows. To fix the second vulnerability, the code
