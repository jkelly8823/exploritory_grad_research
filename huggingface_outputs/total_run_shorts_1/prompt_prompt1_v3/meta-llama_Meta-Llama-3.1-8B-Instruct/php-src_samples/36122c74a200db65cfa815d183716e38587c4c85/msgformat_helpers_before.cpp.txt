VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflow when converting a double to an int64. This is because the code checks if the double value is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum int64 value, but it does not handle the case where the double value is exactly equal to the maximum or minimum int64 value.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a retry mechanism to handle the case where the double value is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum int64 value. However, this mechanism is not sufficient to handle the case where the double value is exactly equal to the maximum or minimum int64 value. This is because the retry mechanism will continue to retry until the value is converted, but it will not handle the case where the value is exactly equal to the maximum or minimum int64 value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the double value is exactly equal to the maximum or minimum int64 value before retrying. This can be done by adding a check for equality before the retry mechanism. Additionally, the code should consider using a more robust data type, such as a 128-bit integer,
