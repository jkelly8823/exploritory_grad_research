VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (arg) to store a user-controlled string (path).
EXPLANATION: The function ftp_get() takes a path parameter which is a string. However, the buffer arg is only 11 characters long, which is not sufficient to hold a path with a variable length. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the path is longer than 10 characters. Additionally, the code does not perform any bounds checking on the path before storing it in the buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the buffer size should be increased to accommodate longer paths. The code should also perform bounds checking on the path to prevent buffer overflows. For example, the buffer size can be increased to 1024 characters, and the code can check if the path length is less than or equal to the buffer size before storing it in the buffer. ```php
char arg[1024];
if (strlen(path) <= sizeof(arg)) {
    strcpy(arg, path);
} else {
    // handle error or truncate path
}
``` ```c
```c
