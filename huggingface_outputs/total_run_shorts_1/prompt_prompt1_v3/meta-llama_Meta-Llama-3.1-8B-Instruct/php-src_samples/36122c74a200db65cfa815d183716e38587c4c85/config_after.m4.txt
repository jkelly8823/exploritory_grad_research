 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential issue with the handling of the ODBC_TYPE variable. If the variable is not set, the code will attempt to use the PHP_IODBC variable to determine the ODBC type, but this can lead to unexpected behavior if PHP_IODBC is not set or is set to an invalid value.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Additionally, the code does not properly handle the case where the PKG_CONFIG variable is not set, which can lead to a failure to detect the presence of the iODBC library.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code also uses the PHP_IODBC variable to determine the path to the iODBC library, but this can lead to issues if the library is not installed in the expected location.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a combination of environment variables and hardcoded paths to determine the ODBC type and library path. This can lead to issues if the environment variables are not set or are set to invalid values. The code also does not properly handle the case where the PKG_CONFIG variable is not set, which can lead to a failure to detect the presence of the iODBC library
