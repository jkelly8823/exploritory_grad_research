VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable 'offset' is added to'size' without any bounds checking, which could result in an integer overflow if'size' is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the sum of 'offset' and'size' is equal to 'eocd_offset'. However, it does not check if the sum of 'offset' and'size' is within the bounds of an integer. If'size' is large enough, this could result in an integer overflow, causing the code to produce incorrect results or crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should add bounds checking to ensure that the sum of 'offset' and'size' does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. This can be done by checking if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum value of an integer before performing the addition. Alternatively, the code could use a larger data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to store the sum. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer method to check for equality, such as using a
