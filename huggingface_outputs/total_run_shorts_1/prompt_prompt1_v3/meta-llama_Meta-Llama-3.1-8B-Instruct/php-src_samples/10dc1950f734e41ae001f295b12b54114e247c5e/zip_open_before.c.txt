VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow vulnerability. The variable 'offset' is added to'size' without any bounds checking, which could result in an integer overflow if'size' is large enough.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the sum of 'offset' and'size' is equal to 'eocd_offset'. However, it does not check if the sum of 'offset' and'size' is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. If'size' is large enough, the sum could overflow, resulting in an incorrect comparison.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that the sum of 'offset' and'size' does not overflow. This can be done by checking if the sum is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer before performing the comparison. For example: if ((offset + size) >= INT32_MIN && (offset + size) <= INT32_MAX) {... } else {... }  This will prevent the potential integer overflow vulnerability.  Additionally, consider using unsigned integers to represent sizes and offsets to avoid potential issues with signed
