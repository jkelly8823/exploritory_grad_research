VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability is due to the fact that the code does not properly check the bounds of the buffer before accessing it.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet checks if the offset plus size exceeds the buffer offset plus EOCD offset. However, it does not check if the offset plus size exceeds the actual buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack if the offset and size are crafted to exceed the buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the offset plus size exceeds the actual buffer size before accessing the buffer. This can be done by adding a check for the buffer size before the if statement that checks if the offset plus size exceeds the buffer offset plus EOCD offset. The recommended fix is to add a check for the buffer size and return an error if it is exceeded. For example: if (offset+size > buf_size) { zip_error_set(error, ZIP_ER_SEEK, 0); return NULL; } before the if statement.  Additionally, the code should also check if the offset plus size exceeds the buffer size in the if
