VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the `strchr` function without bounds checking. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is too large.
EXPLANATION: The `strchr` function searches for a character in a string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence of that character. However, if the input string is too large, it can cause the function to access memory outside the bounds of the string, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function like `strchrnul` or `memchr` which do not have the same buffer overflow vulnerability. Alternatively, you can use a manual loop to search for the character, which would also prevent the buffer overflow. Additionally, you should always check the bounds of the input string before passing it to the `strchr` function. 

Note: The vulnerability is present in the lines where the `strchr` function is used without bounds checking, which are lines 14-16. 

Also, note that the `strchr`
