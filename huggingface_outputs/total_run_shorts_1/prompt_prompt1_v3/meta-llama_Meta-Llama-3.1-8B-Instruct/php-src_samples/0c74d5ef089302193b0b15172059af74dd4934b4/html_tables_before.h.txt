VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a fixed-size array (entity_multicodepoint_row) to store a variable number of elements.
EXPLANATION: The entity_multicodepoint_row array is declared with a fixed size of 2 elements, but the code attempts to store 2 elements with a size of 0x0FE00, which is likely a large value. This can cause the array to overflow, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically-sized data structure, such as a vector or a linked list, to store the entity_multicodepoint_row elements. Alternatively, if the size of the array is known and fixed, consider using a fixed-size array with a larger size to accommodate the maximum number of elements. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the array is not accessed out of bounds.  The use of a fixed-size array with a size of 2 is likely a mistake, and the code should be modified to use a more suitable data structure.  The size of 0x0FE00 is likely a large value, and
