VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for out-of-bounds access when accessing the src image. This can lead to a buffer overflow or segmentation fault if the crop coordinates are invalid.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the crop coordinates are within the bounds of the src image, but it does not check if the coordinates are valid. If the crop coordinates are negative or greater than or equal to the image dimensions, the code will attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the src image, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that the crop coordinates are within the valid range before accessing the src image. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the coordinates are within the bounds of the src image. For example: if (crop->x >= 0 && crop->x < src->sx && crop->y >= 0 && crop->y < src->sy) {... }. This will prevent the code from attempting to access memory outside the bounds of the src image.  Additionally, consider using a more robust method to handle out-of-bounds access, such as using a safe image library that handles
