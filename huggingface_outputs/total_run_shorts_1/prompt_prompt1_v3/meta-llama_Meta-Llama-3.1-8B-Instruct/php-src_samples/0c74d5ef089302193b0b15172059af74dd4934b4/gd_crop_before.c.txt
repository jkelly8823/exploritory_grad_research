VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for out-of-bounds access when accessing the src image. This can lead to a buffer overflow or segmentation fault if the crop coordinates are invalid.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the crop coordinates are within the bounds of the src image, but it does not check if the crop coordinates are within the bounds of the dst image. This can lead to a buffer overflow or segmentation fault if the crop coordinates are invalid.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that the crop coordinates are within the bounds of the dst image before accessing the src image. This can be done by checking if crop->x + crop->width <= dst->sx and crop->y + crop->height <= dst->sy. If the crop coordinates are invalid, return an error or handle the situation accordingly.
