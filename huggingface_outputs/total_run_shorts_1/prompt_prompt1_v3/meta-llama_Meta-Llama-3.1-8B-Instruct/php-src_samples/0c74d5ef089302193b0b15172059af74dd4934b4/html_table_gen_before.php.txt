 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the lack of proper sanitization of the variable $name.
EXPLANATION: The variable $name is directly used in the echo statement without any sanitization or validation. This makes it susceptible to SQL injection attacks if an attacker can manipulate the value of $name. The use of ksort() on the $multicp_rows array does not mitigate this vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Alternatively, the value of $name should be properly sanitized and validated before using it in the echo statement. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensuring that it only contains allowed characters. Additionally, the use of ksort() on the $multicp_rows array is unnecessary and can be removed.  ```php echo "/* {{{ Start of double code point tables for ". htmlspecialchars($name). " */", "\n\n"; ``` or ```php $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = :name"); $stmt->bindParam(':name
