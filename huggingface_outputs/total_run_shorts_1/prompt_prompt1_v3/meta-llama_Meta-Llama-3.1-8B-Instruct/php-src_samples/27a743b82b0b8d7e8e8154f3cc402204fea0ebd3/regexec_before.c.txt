VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking on the `*low` variable.
EXPLANATION: The `*low` variable is assigned the value of `p - reg->dmax` without checking if it is within the valid range of the `str` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if `p - reg->dmax` is greater than the length of the `str` array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that `*low` is within the valid range of the `str` array before assigning it a value. This can be done by checking if `p - reg->dmax` is less than or equal to the length of the `str` array. If it is not, assign a safe value to `*low` to prevent the buffer overflow. For example: `if (p - reg->dmax <= strlen(str)) { *low = p - reg->dmax; } else { *low = 0; }`. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector or array, to store the `str`
