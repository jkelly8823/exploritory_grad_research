VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of bounds checking on the `*low` pointer when assigning it the value of `p - reg->dmax`. This can lead to a situation where `*low` points to memory outside the bounds of the `str` array, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises when `p - reg->dmax` is greater than the length of the `str` array. In this case, `*low` is assigned the value of `p - reg->dmax`, which can be a pointer to memory outside the bounds of the `str` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the memory at that location is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that `*low` does not point to memory outside the bounds of the `str` array. This can be done by checking if `p - reg->dmax` is within the valid range of the `str` array before assigning it to `*low`. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array,
