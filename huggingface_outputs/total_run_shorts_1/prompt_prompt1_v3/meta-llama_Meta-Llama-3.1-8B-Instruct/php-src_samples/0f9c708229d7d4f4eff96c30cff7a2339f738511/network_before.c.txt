VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `gethostbyname` function, which is not thread-safe on Unix-like systems.
EXPLANATION: The `gethostbyname` function is not thread-safe on Unix-like systems, which means that it can cause the program to hang or crash if multiple threads are accessing it simultaneously. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `getaddrinfo` function instead of `gethostbyname`. The `getaddrinfo` function is thread-safe and provides more features than `gethostbyname`. Additionally, the code should check the return value of `getaddrinfo` to handle any errors that may occur. For example: `if (getaddrinfo(host, NULL, &hints, &res)!= 0) {... }`. This will prevent the program from hanging or crashing due to a DoS attack. 

Note: The `getaddrinfo` function is available on Unix-like systems, which is why the `HAVE_GET
