VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of the `gethostbyname` function, which is deprecated and can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving host names.
EXPLANATION: The `gethostbyname` function is deprecated and can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving host names. This is because it does not perform any bounds checking on the host name, and can lead to a buffer overflow if the host name is too long. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the `getaddrinfo` function instead, which is a safer alternative. Additionally, consider using a more modern and secure method for resolving host names, such as using a DNS library. If you must use `gethostbyname`, ensure that the host name is properly sanitized and validated to prevent buffer overflows. 

Note: The `gethostbyname` function is deprecated since C99 and removed in C11. The `getaddrinfo` function is the recommended replacement. 

Also, the `MAXHOSTNAMELEN` constant is not defined in this snippet, but it is assumed to be a valid constant.
