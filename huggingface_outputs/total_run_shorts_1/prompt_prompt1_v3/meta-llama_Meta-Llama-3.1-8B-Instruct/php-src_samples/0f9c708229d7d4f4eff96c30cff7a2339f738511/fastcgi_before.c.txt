VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of gethostbyname() which is deprecated and can lead to a buffer overflow when resolving hostnames.
EXPLANATION: The gethostbyname() function is deprecated and has been removed from the POSIX standard. It is also known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows when resolving hostnames. This can lead to a security vulnerability if an attacker is able to manipulate the hostname to be resolved. The use of this function is not recommended and should be replaced with a safer alternative such as getaddrinfo().
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the use of gethostbyname() with getaddrinfo(). This can be done by using the following code: struct addrinfo hints, *res; memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints)); hints.ai_family = AF_INET; hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; getaddrinfo(host, NULL, &hints, &res); if (res == NULL) {... } else {... } This will provide a safer alternative for resolving hostnames. Additionally, consider using a more modern and secure method for resolving hostnames, such as using a DNS library.
