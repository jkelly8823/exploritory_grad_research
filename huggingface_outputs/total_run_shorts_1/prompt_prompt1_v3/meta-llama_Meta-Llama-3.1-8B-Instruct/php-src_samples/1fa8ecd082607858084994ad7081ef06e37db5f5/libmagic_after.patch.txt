 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1825, 1834
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the regular expression is not properly anchored, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious input that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression is not anchored to the start of the string, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious input that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources. This can lead to a denial of service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be properly anchored to the start of the string. This can be done by adding a caret (^) at the start of the regular expression. Additionally, the regular expression should be optimized to prevent excessive resource consumption. This can be done by using a more efficient regular expression engine or by limiting the number of iterations of the regular expression engine.
