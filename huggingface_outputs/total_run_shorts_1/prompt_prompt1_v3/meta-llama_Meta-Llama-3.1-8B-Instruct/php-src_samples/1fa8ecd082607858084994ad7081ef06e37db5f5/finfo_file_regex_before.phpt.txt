 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a regex denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the regular expression used in the finfo_file() function is not properly anchored, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious input that causes the function to take an excessive amount of time to process.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in the finfo_file() function is not properly anchored, which allows an attacker to craft a malicious input that causes the function to take an excessive amount of time to process. This is a classic example of a regex denial of service (ReDoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression used in the finfo_file() function should be properly anchored using the '^' character at the beginning and the '$' character at the end. This will prevent an attacker from crafting a malicious input that causes the function to take an excessive amount of time to process. Additionally, the regular expression should be optimized to reduce the number of backtracking steps, which can also help to prevent ReDoS attacks. For example, the regular expression could be rewritten as '/^.*\.(txt|pdf)$/',
