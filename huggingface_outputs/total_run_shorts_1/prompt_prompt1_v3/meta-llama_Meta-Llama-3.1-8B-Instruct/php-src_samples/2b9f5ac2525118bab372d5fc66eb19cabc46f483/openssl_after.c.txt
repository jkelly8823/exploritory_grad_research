VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of BIO_puts() and BIO_write() functions without checking the length of the data being written. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow if the data being written is larger than the allocated buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The BIO_puts() and BIO_write() functions are used to write data to the bio_out stream. However, these functions do not check the length of the data being written, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the allocated buffer size. This can be exploited by an attacker to write arbitrary data to the stack, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the data being written before calling BIO_puts() and BIO_write(). This can be done by using the BIO_get_mem_ptr() function to get the current buffer size and then checking if the data being written is within the allocated buffer size. If the data is larger than the allocated buffer size, an error should be returned. Additionally, consider using a safer function like BIO_printf() which is designed to handle formatting and prevent
