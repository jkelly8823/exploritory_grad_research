VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack because it loads XML files from the file system without validating their contents. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to validate the XML files before loading them. This can be done by using a library like DOMDocument::loadXML() with the LIBXML_NOENT and LIBXML_NOERROR flags set. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle errors and exceptions properly, and to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. For example, the code could be modified to use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that occur when loading the XML files, and to log any errors that occur. The code could also be modified to use a whitelist of allowed XML files to prevent an attacker from loading malicious XML code.
