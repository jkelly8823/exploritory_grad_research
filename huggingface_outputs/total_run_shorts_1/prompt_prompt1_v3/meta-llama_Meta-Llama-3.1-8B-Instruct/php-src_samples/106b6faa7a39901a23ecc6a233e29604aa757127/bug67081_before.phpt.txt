VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack because it loads XML files from the file system without validating or sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use the `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` function to disable the XML entity loader, which is the root cause of the XXE vulnerability. You can also use the `DOMDocument::loadXML()` method instead of `DOMDocument::load()`, which allows you to specify a flag to prevent external entity loading. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the XML input and ensure it conforms to a specific schema. Finally, ensure that the XML files are stored in a secure location and are not accessible to unauthorized users. 

Note: The lines mentioned in VULNERABLE_LINES are the lines where the XML files are loaded. The first three lines load XML files with names that suggest they are part of a
