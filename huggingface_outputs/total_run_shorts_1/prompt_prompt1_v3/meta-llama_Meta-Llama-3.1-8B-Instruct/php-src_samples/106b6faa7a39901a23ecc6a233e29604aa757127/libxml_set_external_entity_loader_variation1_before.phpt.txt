VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to the'resolveExternals' property being set to true.
EXPLANATION: The'resolveExternals' property is set to true, which allows the DOMDocument to resolve external entities. This can lead to XXE attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious XML code that can be used to access local files or execute system commands.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, set the'resolveExternals' property to false. This will prevent the DOMDocument from resolving external entities and thus prevent XXE attacks. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific XML files to be loaded. This can be achieved by using the 'loadXML' method with a file path instead of a string. For example: $r = $dd->loadXML('path/to/allowed/xml/file.xml');. This will ensure that only the specified XML file is loaded and prevent any potential XXE attacks.  ```php
$allowed_xml_files = array('allowed_file1.xml', 'allowed_file2.xml');
$xml_file = 'path/to/xml/file.xml';
