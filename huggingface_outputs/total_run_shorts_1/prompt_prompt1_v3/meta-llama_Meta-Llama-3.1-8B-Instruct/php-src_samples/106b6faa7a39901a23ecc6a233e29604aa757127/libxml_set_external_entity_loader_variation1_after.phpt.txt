VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to the'resolveExternals' property being set to true.
EXPLANATION: The'resolveExternals' property allows the XML parser to resolve external entities, which can lead to XXE attacks. An attacker could inject malicious external entities into the XML, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exposure. This vulnerability is particularly concerning when parsing untrusted XML data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, set the'resolveExternals' property to false. This will prevent the XML parser from resolving external entities, thereby mitigating the risk of XXE attacks. Additionally, consider using a more secure XML parsing library or function that does not allow external entity resolution. Always validate and sanitize untrusted XML data before parsing it.  ```php $dd->resolveExternals = false; ```  ```php $dd->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_NOERROR | LIBXML_NOWARNING); ```  ```php $dd->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_NOERROR | LIBXML_NOWARNING | LIBXML_DTDVALID);
