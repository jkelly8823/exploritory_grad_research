VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet creates a new String object using the `new String()` constructor, which can lead to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. This is because the `new String()` constructor can create a new string object with a different encoding than the original bytes, potentially leading to a buffer overflow if the new string is larger than the original bytes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using the `String(byte[] bytes, int offset, int length)` constructor instead, which allows for more control over the string creation process and can help prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, consider using a library like Guava's `CharStreams` class to safely convert bytes to a string. 

Note: The `highByte` variable is not shown in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a byte value that is used to determine the encoding of the string.
