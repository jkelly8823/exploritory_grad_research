VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function contains_char() dynamically allocates memory for a string of 20 characters, but then uses a while loop to iterate over the string, incrementing a pointer to the next character. However, the loop does not check if the pointer has reached the end of the string, and instead continues to increment the pointer until it points to a null character. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large input string, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the while loop does not properly check if the pointer has reached the end of the string. The loop continues to increment the pointer until it points to a null character, which is not necessarily the end of the string. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer by providing a large input string. Additionally, the function uses a fixed-size buffer of 20 characters, which can be easily exceeded by a large input string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to properly check if the pointer has reached the end of the string. This can be done by checking
