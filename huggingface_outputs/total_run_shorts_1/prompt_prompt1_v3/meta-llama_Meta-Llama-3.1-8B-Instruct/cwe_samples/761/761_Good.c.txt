VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The function `cointains_char` dynamically allocates memory for a string of 20 characters, but then uses `strcpy` to copy a string of unknown length into that memory. This can cause the buffer to overflow if the input string is longer than 20 characters.
EXPLANATION: The `strcpy` function does not perform any bounds checking, so it will copy the entire input string into the allocated memory, regardless of its length. If the input string is longer than 20 characters, it will overflow the buffer, causing undefined behavior. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, where an attacker can inject malicious data into the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function like `strncpy` to copy the input string into the allocated memory, and ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the input string. Additionally, the code should check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer to prevent buffer overflows. The corrected code should look like this: `strncpy(str, "Search Me!", 20);
