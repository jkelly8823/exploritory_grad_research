 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the use of the role "ANYONE" which grants access to the getSalary method of the Employee EJB. This is a security risk as it allows anyone to access the salary information of employees.
EXPLANATION: The use of the role "ANYONE" in the method-permission element is a security risk. This role grants access to the getSalary method of the Employee EJB, allowing anyone to access the salary information of employees. This is a potential security vulnerability as it may allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the role "ANYONE" should be replaced with a more secure role that only grants access to authorized personnel. For example, the role "HR" could be used to grant access to the getSalary method of the Employee EJB. Additionally, the method-permission element should be reviewed to ensure that only necessary methods are granted access to the specified role.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that the role "ANYONE" is not used elsewhere in the application.  The application should be tested to ensure that the changes do not introduce any new security
