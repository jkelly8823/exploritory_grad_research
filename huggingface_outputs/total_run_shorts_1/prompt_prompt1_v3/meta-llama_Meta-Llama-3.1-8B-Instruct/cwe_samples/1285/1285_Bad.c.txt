VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The `gen_recv` function returns the number of bytes received, which is assigned to the variable `ok`. However, the `while` loop condition checks if `ok` is equal to 0, indicating the end of the message. This is incorrect because `gen_recv` returns the number of bytes received, not a boolean indicating the end of the message. As a result, the loop will continue even after the message has ended, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Change the `while` loop condition to `while ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) < 0)` to correctly handle the end of the message. Also, consider using a safer function like `recv` instead of `gen_recv` to avoid potential buffer overflows. Additionally, consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the `sizes` array is not overflowed.  ```c
while ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) < 0) {
    if (DOTLINE(buf)) break;
    else if (sscanf(buf, "%d %d", &num,
