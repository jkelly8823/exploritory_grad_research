VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential NullPointerException can be thrown when calling the getProductSummary method, because the productSummary variable is reassigned within a try block, but the return statement is outside the try block.
EXPLANATION: 
The productSummary variable is reassigned within the try block, but the return statement is outside the try block. If an exception is thrown within the try block, the return statement will not be executed, and the function will return null. However, if the exception is caught and handled within the catch block, the productSummary variable will be reassigned to an empty string. If this method is called and the exception is not thrown, the function will return the productSummary string. However, if this method is called and the exception is thrown, the function will return null.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Move the return statement inside the try block to ensure that the correct value is returned in all cases. Alternatively, reassign the productSummary variable within the catch block to a default value to ensure that the function returns a valid value in all cases.
