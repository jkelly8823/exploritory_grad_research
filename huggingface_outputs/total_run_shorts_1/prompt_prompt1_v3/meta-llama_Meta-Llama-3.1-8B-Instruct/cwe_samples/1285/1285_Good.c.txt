VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `getsizes` function. The `buf` variable has a fixed size of `BUFFER_SIZE`, but it is used to store data received from the socket without any bounds checking. If the received data is larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`, it can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `gen_recv` function reads data from the socket into the `buf` array, but it does not check if the data exceeds the buffer size. If the received data is larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`, it can overflow the buffer, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer function like `recv` or `read` that allows you to specify the maximum number of bytes to read. Alternatively, you can use `recv` with the `MSG_TRUNC` flag to discard excess data. Additionally, consider using a dynamically allocated buffer or a buffer with a larger size to prevent overflow. It's also a good practice to check the return value of `gen_recv` to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size.  .
