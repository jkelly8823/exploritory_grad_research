VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The class Customer is annotated with @Entity, but it does not extend a class that implements the Serializable interface, which is a requirement for JPA entities.
EXPLANATION: In JPA, entities must extend a class that implements the Serializable interface. This is because JPA uses serialization to persist and retrieve entities. If the Customer class does not extend a class that implements Serializable, it will not be able to be persisted or retrieved correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The Customer class should extend a class that implements the Serializable interface, such as Object. For example: public class Customer extends Object implements Serializable. Alternatively, the class can extend a class that already implements Serializable, such as a base entity class.  Also, the class should be annotated with @Table to specify the name of the database table that will be used to store the entity. For example: @Table(name = "customers") public class Customer extends Object implements Serializable.  The @Table annotation is not shown in this code snippet, but it is a good practice to include it to specify the table name.  The @Table annotation can be used to specify other properties of the table, such as
