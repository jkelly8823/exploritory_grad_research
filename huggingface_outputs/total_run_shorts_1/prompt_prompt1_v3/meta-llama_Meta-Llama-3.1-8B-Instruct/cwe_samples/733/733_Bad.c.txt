VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to fixed-size buffer 'pwd' being used to store user input, which can be larger than the buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The function 'GetPasswordFromUser' is expected to store the user input in the 'pwd' buffer. However, the buffer size is fixed at 64 characters, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the user input is larger than the buffer size. This can result in undefined behavior, including potential code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a dynamically allocated buffer or a buffer with a larger size to store the user input. Alternatively, use a function that securely stores the user input, such as 'getpass' in Unix-like systems. Additionally, consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as hashing and salting.  Consider using a secure password storage mechanism, such as hashing and salting.
