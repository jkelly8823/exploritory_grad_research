VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection and authentication bypass attacks. The user input from the $_POST['user'] and $_POST['pass'] variables is directly used in the login_user() function without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code or bypass authentication by manipulating the user input. The if statement checks the return value of the login_user() function, but it does not provide any protection against SQL injection or authentication bypass attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to sanitize and validate the user input using prepared statements or parameterized queries. The login_user() function should be modified to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the code should implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent authentication bypass attacks. For example, the code could use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store passwords securely. The code should also implement a secure way to handle user input, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters or using a library like HTML Purifier to sanitize user input.
