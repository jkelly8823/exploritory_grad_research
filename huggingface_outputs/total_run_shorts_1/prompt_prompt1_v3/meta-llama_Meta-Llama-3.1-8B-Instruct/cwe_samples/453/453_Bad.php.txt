VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses user input ($user and $pass) in the login_user() function without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input values.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the user input from the SQL code. For example, you can use a library like PDO to execute the query with placeholders for the user input. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure it conforms to expected formats. This will prevent malicious input from being executed as SQL code.
