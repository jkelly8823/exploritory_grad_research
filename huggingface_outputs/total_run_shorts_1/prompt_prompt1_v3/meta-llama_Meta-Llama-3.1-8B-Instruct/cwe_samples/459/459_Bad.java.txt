VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of the `available()` method to determine the size of the file. This method can return an incorrect value if the file is being written to or if the file descriptor is not yet open. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the file is too large to fit into memory, which can cause an `OutOfMemoryError`.
EXPLANATION: The `available()` method is not a reliable way to determine the size of a file. It returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) without blocking, which is not the same as the actual size of the file. This can lead to incorrect assumptions about the size of the file, which can cause problems if the file is being written to or if the file descriptor is not yet open. Furthermore, the code does not handle the case where the file is too large to fit into memory, which can cause an `OutOfMemoryError`. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the program to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
