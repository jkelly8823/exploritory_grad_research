VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This is because the user input is directly used to set a cookie without any sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The function persistLogin takes in user input for $username and $password. These values are then directly used to set a cookie named "userdata". This is a problem because an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the $username or $password fields, which would then be executed when the cookie is set. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including stealing user sessions or injecting malware.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should sanitize and validate the user input before using it to set the cookie. You can use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize the input, or you can use a whitelist approach to only allow certain characters in the input. Additionally, consider using a more secure method of storing user data, such as using a secure cookie or a server-side session. Finally, make sure to handle any errors that may occur when setting the cookie.  You should also consider using HTTPS to encrypt the cookie.  You should
