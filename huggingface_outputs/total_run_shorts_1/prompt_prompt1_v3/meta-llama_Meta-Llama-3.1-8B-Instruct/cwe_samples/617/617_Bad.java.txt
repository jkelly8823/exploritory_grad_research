VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct parameter extraction from user input without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code directly extracts the "email_address" parameter from the HTTP request without any validation or sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the "email_address" parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a prepared statement or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use a JDBC prepared statement or a library like Hibernate to safely execute SQL queries. Additionally, validate and sanitize user input to prevent any malicious data from being injected into the database.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Null Pointer Exception vulnerability due to direct null assertion without proper handling.
EXPLANATION: The code directly asserts that the "email" variable is not null without any handling for the case where it is null. This can lead to a Null Pointer Exception if the "email" variable is indeed null. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a try-catch block to handle the potential Null Pointer Exception. Alternatively, use the Optional
