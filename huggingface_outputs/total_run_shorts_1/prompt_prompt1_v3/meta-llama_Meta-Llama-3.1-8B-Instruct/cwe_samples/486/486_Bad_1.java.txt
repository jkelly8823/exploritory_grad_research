VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The equals method is vulnerable to a potential NullPointerException when the object passed to it is null. This is because the getClass().getName() method will throw a NullPointerException when called on a null object.
EXPLANATION: The equals method is checking if the object passed to it is of the same class as the current object. However, it does not check if the object is null before calling the getClass().getName() method. If a null object is passed to the equals method, it will throw a NullPointerException.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the object is null before calling the getClass().getName() method. This can be done by adding a simple null check at the beginning of the equals method. For example: if (obj == null) return false;. This will prevent the NullPointerException from being thrown and ensure that the equals method behaves correctly even when a null object is passed to it.  Additionally, the equals method should also check for the correct type of the object, not just the class name. This can be done by using the instanceof operator to check if the object is an instance of the correct class. For example
