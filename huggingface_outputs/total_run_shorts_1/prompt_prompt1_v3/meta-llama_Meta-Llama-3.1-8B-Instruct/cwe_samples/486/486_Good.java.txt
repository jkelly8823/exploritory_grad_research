VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a ClassCast Exception. If the inputClass is not an instance of TrustedClass, then a ClassCastException will be thrown.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the '==' operator to compare the class of inputClass with TrustedClass.class. However, this comparison will only be true if the inputClass is an instance of TrustedClass and not if it is a subclass of TrustedClass. This is because the '==' operator checks for reference equality, not class equality. Therefore, if inputClass is a subclass of TrustedClass, then the comparison will be false, and a ClassCastException will be thrown when trying to access TrustedClass members.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use the 'instanceof' operator to check if inputClass is an instance of TrustedClass or any of its subclasses. This can be done by replacing the '==' operator with 'instanceof' as follows: if (inputClass instanceof TrustedClass). This will ensure that the code will not throw a ClassCastException even if inputClass is a subclass of TrustedClass.  Additionally, you should also consider using the 'as' operator to safely
