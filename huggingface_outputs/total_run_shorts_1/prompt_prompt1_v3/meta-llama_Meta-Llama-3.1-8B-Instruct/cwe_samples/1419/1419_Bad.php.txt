VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The user input for $user and $pass is not sanitized or validated. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or even complete control over the database. The function login_user() is likely using the user input directly in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. This involves separating the SQL code from the user input and using placeholders for the input values. 
- Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and patterns. 
- Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks, such as PHP's PDO extension. 
- Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and up-to-date with the latest security best practices. 
- Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of protection against SQL injection attacks.
