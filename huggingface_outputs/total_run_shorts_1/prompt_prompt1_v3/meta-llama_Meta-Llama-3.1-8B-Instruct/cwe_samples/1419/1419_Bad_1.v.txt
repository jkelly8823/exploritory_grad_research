 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This is a potential vulnerability due to the use of an untrusted external signal (~rst_ni) in a sensitive operation (clearing a memory array). If rst_ni is not properly synchronized or is driven by an untrusted source, it could potentially cause the memory array to be cleared unexpectedly, leading to data loss or corruption.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the sensitivity list of the always block includes the non-inverted rst_ni signal. This means that the block will be triggered by a rising edge on rst_ni, which could be driven by an untrusted source. The use of ~rst_ni in the if statement further exacerbates the issue, as it inverts the signal and makes it even more susceptible to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the sensitivity list of the always block should be modified to only include the clk_i signal. The use of ~rst_ni in the if statement should be replaced with a proper synchronization mechanism, such as a flip-flop or a registered signal. Additionally, the rst_ni signal should be properly validated and synchronized before being used in the sensitive operation.
