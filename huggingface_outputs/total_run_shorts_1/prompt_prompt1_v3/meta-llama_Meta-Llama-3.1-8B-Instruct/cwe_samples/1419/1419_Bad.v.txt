VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12, 15, 18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains two instances of insecure device ID registers. The first register (Insecure_Device_ID_1) has an incorrect default value, and the second register (Insecure_Device_ID_2) does not have a default value defined, which will result in a default value of 2^32-2.
EXPLANATION: The code defines two instances of the register_example module, which is intended to demonstrate a secure register design. However, the default values used for these registers are incorrect. The first register has a default value of 1224, which is incorrect because the Secure_mode bit is set to 0. This means that the register will always be writable, which defeats the purpose of the secure register design. The second register does not have a default value defined, which means that it will use the default value
