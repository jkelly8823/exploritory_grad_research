VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user input in a database query without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code directly uses the user input from the POST request in the login_user() function without any validation or sanitization. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can be achieved by using a library like PDO or mysqli. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize the user input to prevent any malicious characters from being injected into the database query. For example, the code could use a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters in the user input. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code and ensure the security of the database.  The login_user() function should also be reviewed and updated to use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
