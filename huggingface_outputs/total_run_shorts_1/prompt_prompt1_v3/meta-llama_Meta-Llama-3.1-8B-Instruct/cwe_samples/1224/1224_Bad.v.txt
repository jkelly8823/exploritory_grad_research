VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a race condition.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability is present in the always block. The always block is triggered by a positive edge on the Clk signal or a negative edge on the ip_resetn signal. The always block contains a non-blocking assignment to Data_out in the write and non-write conditions. However, the non-blocking assignment to Data_out in the write condition is not properly synchronized with the non-blocking assignment to Data_out in the non-write condition. This can lead to a race condition where the Data_out output is not properly updated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the non-blocking assignment to Data_out in the write condition should be replaced with a blocking assignment. This can be done by replacing the non-blocking assignment with a blocking assignment using the <= operator. Additionally, the non-blocking assignment to Data_out in the non-write condition should be replaced with a blocking assignment. This can be done by replacing the non-blocking assignment with a blocking assignment using the <= operator. The corrected code should look like this: always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip_resetn) if (~ip_resetn) begin Data_out <=
