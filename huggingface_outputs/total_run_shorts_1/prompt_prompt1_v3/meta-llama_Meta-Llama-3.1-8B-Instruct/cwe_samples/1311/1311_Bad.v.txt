 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16-20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a vulnerability due to the potential for a race condition in the always @* block. The use of the non-blocking assignment operator (=) in the assign statement can lead to a race condition when the value of y is updated simultaneously with the assignment of p0_mreqinfo_o_temp[6:0].
EXPLANATION: The always @* block is sensitive to all signals, which means that it will be triggered whenever any signal changes. In this case, the assign statement is updating the value of p0_mreqinfo_o_temp[6:0] simultaneously with the update of y. This can lead to a race condition where the value of p0_mreqinfo_o_temp[6:0] is updated before the value of y is updated, resulting in an incorrect value being assigned to ahb_hprot.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the non-blocking assignment operator (=) should be replaced with the blocking assignment operator (<=) in the assign statement. Additionally, the always @* block should be made sensitive only to the signals that are actually being used, rather than all signals. This can be achieved
