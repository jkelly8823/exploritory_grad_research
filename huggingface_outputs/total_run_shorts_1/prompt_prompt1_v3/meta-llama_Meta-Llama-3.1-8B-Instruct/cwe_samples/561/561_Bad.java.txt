VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: This code snippet appears to be a simple example of a recursive function call. The `doTweedledee` method calls `doTweedledumb`, which in turn calls `doTweedledee`. This creates an infinite recursion, but it is not a vulnerability in the classical sense. The code will eventually run out of stack space and throw a `StackOverflowError`, but this is a runtime error rather than a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To avoid this issue, the code could be modified to use a loop instead of recursion, or the recursive calls could be limited to prevent stack overflow. However, this is not a security vulnerability and is more of a coding error.  The code could also be modified to handle the `StackOverflowError` exception, but this would not address the underlying issue.  The code could also be modified to use a more efficient data structure or algorithm to avoid the need for recursion.  However, this is not a security vulnerability and is more of a coding error.  The code could also be modified to use a more efficient data structure
