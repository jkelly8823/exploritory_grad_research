VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the direct addition of untrusted user input to a HTTP response header.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet directly adds untrusted user input to a HTTP response header without proper sanitization or validation. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or code into the response, potentially leading to XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the untrusted user input is properly sanitized and validated before adding it to the HTTP response header. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the input, or by using a library that provides input sanitization and validation. Additionally, consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to help prevent XSS attacks.  ```javascript
const sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(untrustedRawInputData);
response.addHeader(HEADER_NAME, sanitizedInput);
```  ```python
import html
sanitizedInput = html.escape(untrustedRawInputData)
response.addHeader(HEADER_NAME, sanitizedInput)
```  ```java
import org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils;
String sanitizedInput = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(untrusted
