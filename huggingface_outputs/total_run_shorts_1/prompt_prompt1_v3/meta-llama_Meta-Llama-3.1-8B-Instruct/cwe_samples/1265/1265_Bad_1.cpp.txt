 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the `setup` method due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `_uri` parameter.
EXPLANATION: The `setup` method takes a `ScriptObject* _uri` parameter and directly assigns it to the `uri` member variable without any input validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious SQL code by passing a specially crafted script object as the `_uri` parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the `_uri` parameter before assigning it to the `uri` member variable. This can be achieved by using a whitelist of allowed characters or a library that provides input validation and sanitization functionality. Additionally, consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The `send` method should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not introduce any other vulnerabilities.
