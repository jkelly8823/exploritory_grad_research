VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect calculation of buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The function proc_msg() assumes that all strings have a preamble with a fixed length of 10 characters. However, the code snippet does not guarantee this, and the variable msg_len can be larger than the preamble length, leading to a buffer overflow. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function proc_msg() should be modified to dynamically calculate the buffer size based on the input string length. This can be done by using the strlen() function to get the length of the preamble and then subtracting the length of the input string. Additionally, the code should check for buffer overflow conditions before allocating memory. The corrected code should look like this: int proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len) { int pre_len = strlen("preamble: ") + 1; char buf[pre_len - msg_len];... Do processing here if we get this far }. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the definition of the function strlen(), but it is assumed to be available in the standard library.
