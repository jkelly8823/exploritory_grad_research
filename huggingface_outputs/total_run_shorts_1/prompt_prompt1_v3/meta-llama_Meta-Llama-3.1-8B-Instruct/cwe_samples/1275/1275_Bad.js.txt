VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to cookie domain hijacking attacks. This occurs when an attacker can set a cookie with the same domain as the legitimate website, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's session.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the use of a hardcoded domain 'example.com' in the cookieOptions. This allows an attacker to set a cookie with the same domain, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's session. To mitigate this, the domain should be set to the current domain of the website, or a more secure approach should be used, such as using a secure cookie with a secure flag.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the 'domain' property of the request object to set the domain of the cookie to the current domain of the website. Alternatively, consider using a secure cookie with a secure flag. For example, `response.cookie('sessionid', sessionId, { domain: request.domain, secure: true })`.  Additionally, consider implementing a secure random session ID generation mechanism, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.  Also, consider implementing a cookie expiration mechanism to prevent session
