VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure cookie configuration due to the use of a weak cookie name, 'sessionid', which is easily guessable and can lead to session hijacking attacks.
EXPLANATION: The cookie name 'sessionid' is too generic and can be easily guessed by an attacker. This allows them to hijack the user's session by setting their own cookie with the same name. To prevent this, a stronger, more unique cookie name should be used.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a cryptographically secure random string as the cookie name, such as 'session_id_1234567890abcdef'. Additionally, consider using a secure cookie flag to ensure the cookie is transmitted over HTTPS. Also, make sure to validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential XSS attacks.
