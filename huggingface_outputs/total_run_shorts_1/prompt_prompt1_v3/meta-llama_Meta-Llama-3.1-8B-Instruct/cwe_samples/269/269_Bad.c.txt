VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a race condition vulnerability due to the use of seteuid() function. The seteuid() function sets the effective user ID of the current process, but it does not guarantee that the change will be immediate. This can lead to a situation where the process is executing with elevated privileges for a short period of time, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The seteuid() function is used to set the effective user ID of the current process. However, this function does not guarantee that the change will be immediate. The change may take some time to propagate, during which the process may be executing with elevated privileges. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by performing actions that require elevated privileges before the change takes effect.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the setresuid() function instead of seteuid(). The setresuid() function sets the real, effective, and saved user IDs of the current process, and it guarantees that the change will be immediate. Additionally, the code should ensure that the getuid() function is
