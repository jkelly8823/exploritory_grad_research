VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a certificate validation bypass attack. This is because the code checks if the certificate is not null and if the verification result is X509_V_OK, but it does not check if the certificate is trusted or if the verification result is X509_V_ERR_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the OpenSSL library to verify the peer's certificate. However, it does not perform a thorough verification of the certificate. It only checks if the certificate is not null and if the verification result is X509_V_OK. This means that an attacker could potentially present a self-signed certificate or a certificate that has expired, and the code would still consider it valid. This is a serious vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass certificate validation and potentially gain access to sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform a more thorough verification of the certificate. This could include checking if the certificate is trusted, if the verification result is X509_V_OK, and if the certificate has not expired. The code should also be modified to handle any errors that may occur during the verification process. For example
