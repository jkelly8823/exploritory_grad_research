VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a file inclusion vulnerability. This is because the file_get_contents function is used to read the file into a string without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate the $filename variable to include malicious files or directories, leading to unintended behavior or even code execution.
EXPLANATION: The file_get_contents function is used to read the contents of a file into a string. However, this function does not perform any validation or sanitization on the file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the $filename variable to include malicious files or directories, such as /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow, which could lead to unintended behavior or even code execution. Additionally, if the file is not found, the code will still attempt to echo the file contents, which could lead to a PHP warning or error message.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the $filename variable before passing it to the file_get_contents function. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed file extensions or directories, or by using a function like realpath to normalize the file path. Additionally, the code should handle the
