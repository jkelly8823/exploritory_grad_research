VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The password is stored in memory as a character array, which can be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, the password is stored in memory as a character array, which can be accessed by other parts of the program, potentially leading to information disclosure.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is storing a password in memory as a character array. This is a potential security risk because an attacker could potentially overflow the buffer by providing a password that is longer than the allocated space. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Additionally, storing the password in memory as a character array makes it accessible to other parts of the program, potentially leading to information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use a secure method to store the password, such as hashing and salting it. 
2. Use a fixed-size buffer to store the password, and ensure that the password is null-terminated to prevent buffer overflow attacks. 
3. Avoid storing sensitive information such as passwords in memory. Instead, store it securely using a secure storage mechanism. 
4. Use a secure library or framework to handle password storage and verification. 
5. Consider using a password hashing
