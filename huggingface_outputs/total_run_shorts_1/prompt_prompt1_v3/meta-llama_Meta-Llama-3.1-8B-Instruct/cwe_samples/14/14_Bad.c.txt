VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability when the password entered by the user is longer than the size of the buffer 'pwd'. This is because the function 'GetPasswordFromUser' does not check the length of the password before storing it in the buffer, and the buffer size is fixed at 64 characters.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a fixed-size buffer 'pwd' to store the password entered by the user. However, the function 'GetPasswordFromUser' does not check the length of the password before storing it in the buffer. This means that if the user enters a password longer than 64 characters, the buffer will overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to dynamically allocate memory for the password based on the length of the password entered by the user, or use a secure function like 'fgets' to read the password from the user, which can handle passwords of any length. Additionally, the code should be modified to check the length of the password before storing it in the buffer to prevent buffer overflows. The 'memset' function is used to clear
