VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking in the strncpy function.
EXPLANATION: The strncpy function does not perform bounds checking, which means it will copy up to LOG_INPUT_SIZE characters from the source string to the destination buffer. However, if the source string is longer than LOG_INPUT_SIZE characters, it will overflow the destination buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use the strlcpy function instead of strncpy, which performs bounds checking and prevents buffer overflows. Alternatively, you can use a safer function like snprintf to copy the string to the buffer. Additionally, you should consider using a more secure logging mechanism that can handle large input sizes.
