VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking in the strncpy function.
EXPLANATION: The strncpy function does not guarantee null-termination of the destination buffer if the source string is longer than the destination buffer. In this case, the destination buffer is a fixed-size buffer, and the source string is a filename which can be arbitrarily long. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like strlcpy or snprintf to copy the filename to the buffer, and ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the filename and a null-terminator. Alternatively, use a dynamically allocated buffer to avoid fixed-size buffer limitations. Additionally, consider using a safer function like realpath to get the absolute path of the filename, which can help prevent path traversal attacks.  ```c
strlcpy(buf, filename, sizeof(buf));
``` or ```snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", filename);``` would be safer alternatives. ```c
char *realpath(const char *path, char *buf);
``` could be used to get the absolute path of the filename. ```c
