VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the destination buffer 'dest' due to the use of'sizeof(dest)-1' as the number of characters to copy from the source buffer.
EXPLANATION: The'strncpy' function does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source buffer is longer than the destination buffer. In this case, the source buffer has a length of 21 characters, while the destination buffer has a length of 12 characters. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source buffer is longer than the destination buffer. The use of'sizeof(dest)-1' as the number of characters to copy does not prevent this buffer overflow, as it does not account for the null-terminator that'strncpy' may not add to the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use'strncpy_s' instead of'strncpy' to prevent buffer overflows. Alternatively, use'strcpy' and manually null-terminate the destination buffer to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, consider using a safer function like'snprintf' to copy strings.  Ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the source string, including the null-termin
