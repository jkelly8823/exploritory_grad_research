VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression used in this code is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack because it uses the pattern \2\s? in a possessive quantifier. This allows an attacker to create a catastrophic backtracking situation, causing the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, we can use a more secure regular expression that does not use possessive quantifiers or other constructs that can lead to catastrophic backtracking. One possible fix is to use the following regular expression: $gdrslt =~ /^((\w+)\s?)*$/i;. This regular expression uses a non-possessive quantifier to prevent the catastrophic backtracking situation. Alternatively, we can use a more secure regular expression library, such as PCRE, which has built-in protections against ReDoS attacks. We can also use the qr// operator to precompile the regular expression, which can help to prevent ReDoS attacks. Finally, we can use a more secure string validation approach,
