 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The regular expression pattern is vulnerable to a catastrophic backtracking (CBT) attack, which can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression pattern contains a nested repetition (`(?=(\w+))\2`) that can cause the regex engine to enter an infinite loop when matching certain strings. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the nested repetition with a more efficient pattern that does not allow CBT. For example, you can use a possessive quantifier (`+`) to prevent backtracking, like this: `var good_pattern  = /^\w+(?:\s\w+)*$/i;` This will prevent the regex engine from entering an infinite loop and reduce the risk of a DoS attack. Alternatively, you can use a more robust regex engine that is resistant to CBT attacks, such as the PCRE engine in PHP. However, this may require significant changes to your code.
