VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The regular expression pattern used in this code is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is because the pattern `^(\w+\s?)*$` can match an empty string, and the `*` quantifier can cause the regex engine to backtrack indefinitely when the string does not match.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression pattern `^(\w+\s?)*$` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking because it can match an empty string. When the regex engine tries to match this pattern against a string, it will first try to match the `(\w+\s?)` group, which can match a word followed by an optional whitespace character. If the string does not match this group, the regex engine will backtrack and try to match the `(\w+\s?)` group again, but this time with a different number of backtracking steps. This process can repeat indefinitely, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression pattern should be modified to prevent catastrophic backtracking. One way to do this is to use a possess
