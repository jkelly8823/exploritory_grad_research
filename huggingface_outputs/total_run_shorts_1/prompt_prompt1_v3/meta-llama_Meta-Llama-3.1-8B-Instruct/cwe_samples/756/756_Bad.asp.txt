VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the customErrors mode being set to "Off". This allows an attacker to view detailed error messages, potentially revealing sensitive information about the application.
EXPLANATION: The customErrors mode is used to control how the ASP.NET runtime handles errors. Setting it to "Off" means that detailed error messages will be displayed to the user, which can be a security risk if not handled properly. An attacker could potentially use this information to launch a targeted attack on the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, set the customErrors mode to "On" or "RemoteOnly" to prevent detailed error messages from being displayed to the user. This will help to prevent sensitive information from being revealed to potential attackers. Additionally, consider implementing a custom error page to handle errors in a more secure and user-friendly way.  ```python
