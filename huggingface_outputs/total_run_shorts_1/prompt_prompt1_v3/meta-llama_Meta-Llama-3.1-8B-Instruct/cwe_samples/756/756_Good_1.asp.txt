VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the use of the customErrors mode set to "On". This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information about the application's configuration and internal workings.
EXPLANATION: The customErrors mode is set to "On", which means that if an error occurs on the server, the error message will be displayed to the user. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application, such as database connection strings or other internal details. An attacker could use this information to launch a targeted attack on the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this risk, the customErrors mode should be set to "RemoteOnly" or "Off". This will prevent the display of error messages to users and reduce the risk of sensitive information being exposed. Additionally, consider implementing a custom error page that provides a generic error message to users, rather than displaying the actual error message. This will help to prevent attackers from gathering information about the application's internal workings.  ```csharp
