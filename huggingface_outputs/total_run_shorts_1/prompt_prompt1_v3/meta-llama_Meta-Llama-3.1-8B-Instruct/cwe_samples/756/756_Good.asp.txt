VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the use of the "RemoteOnly" mode in the customErrors configuration. This mode allows an attacker to view the stack trace of an error, potentially revealing sensitive information about the application.
EXPLANATION: The customErrors mode is used to control how the ASP.NET runtime handles errors. The "RemoteOnly" mode is intended to prevent attackers from viewing the stack trace of an error, but it can be bypassed by an attacker who is able to access the server's error log. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application, such as the version of the framework, the configuration of the application, and the names of the assemblies in use.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this risk, the customErrors mode should be set to "On" or "Off", depending on the specific requirements of the application. If "On" is chosen, the error messages should be generic and not reveal any sensitive information. If "Off" is chosen, the error messages should be handled by a custom error page or a third-party error handling solution. Additionally, the error log should be secured to prevent unauthorized access
