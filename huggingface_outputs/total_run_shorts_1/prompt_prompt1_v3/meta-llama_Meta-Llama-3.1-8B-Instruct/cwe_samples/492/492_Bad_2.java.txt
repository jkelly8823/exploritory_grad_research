VULNERABLE_LINES: 24, 25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack due to the use of a fixed interval (30 days) for adding interest. An attacker could potentially manipulate the system clock to add interest at a different interval, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the account.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a Timer object to add interest to the account balance every 30 days. However, the Timer object is not thread-safe, and an attacker could potentially manipulate the system clock to add interest at a different interval. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the account.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method for adding interest, such as using a scheduled task or a cron job. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a more secure timer implementation, such as the ScheduledExecutorService class. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is thread-safe and that the system clock cannot be manipulated by an attacker. 

Note: The code is vulnerable to a potential timing attack, but it is not a direct vulnerability in the sense that it allows an attacker to directly access the account. However,
