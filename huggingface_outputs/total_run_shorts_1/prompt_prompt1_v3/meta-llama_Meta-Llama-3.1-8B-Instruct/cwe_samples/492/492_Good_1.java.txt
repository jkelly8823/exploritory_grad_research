VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The BankAccount class has a vulnerability due to the use of a Timer object to add interest to the account balance. This can lead to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker can manipulate the Timer object to add excessive interest to the account balance, causing the balance to overflow and potentially leading to a financial loss.
EXPLANATION: The Timer object is used to add interest to the account balance every 30 days. However, the interest is calculated based on the current balance, which can lead to an exponential increase in the balance if the interest rate is high. If an attacker can manipulate the Timer object to add excessive interest to the account balance, it can cause the balance to overflow, leading to a financial loss. This is a classic example of a DoS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the BankAccount class should use a more secure approach to add interest to the account balance, such as using a scheduled task or a job scheduler to add interest at regular intervals. Additionally, the class should implement proper error handling to prevent the balance from overflowing. The Timer object should be replaced with a more secure alternative
