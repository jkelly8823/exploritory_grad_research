VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the use of a private inner class that has access to the private member variables of the outer class. This is a security risk because it allows the inner class to potentially modify or access sensitive data.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet defines a private inner class `InnerClass` that has access to the private member variables `memberOne` and `memberTwo` of the outer class `OuterClass`. This is a security risk because it allows the inner class to potentially modify or access sensitive data. In a real-world scenario, this could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the inner class should be made non-private, or the private member variables should be made public. However, making the private member variables public is not recommended as it defeats the purpose of encapsulation. A better approach would be to create public getter and setter methods for the private member variables, and use these methods to access and modify the data in the inner class. This way, the data is still encapsulated, but the inner class has controlled access to it. Alternatively, the
