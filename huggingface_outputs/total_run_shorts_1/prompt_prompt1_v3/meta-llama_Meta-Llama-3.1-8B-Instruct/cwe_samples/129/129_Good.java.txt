VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability exists due to a potential NullPointerException that could be thrown when the 'products' array is null. This is because the 'getProductSummary' method does not check for a null 'products' array before attempting to access it.
EXPLANATION: In the 'displayProductSummary' method, a String object 'productSummary' is declared and initialized with a new String object. However, within the same method, another variable named 'productSummary' is declared and assigned a value in the try block. This will cause the original 'productSummary' variable to be overridden, leading to a potential NullPointerException when the method attempts to return the 'productSummary' variable.
Additionally, the 'getProductSummary' method does not check if the 'products' array is null before attempting to access it. If the 'products' array is null, an IndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown, but it will be caught by the 'displayProductSummary' method and the 'ex' variable will be null. In this case, the 'ex.getMessage()' method will throw a NullPointerException.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'displayProductSummary'
