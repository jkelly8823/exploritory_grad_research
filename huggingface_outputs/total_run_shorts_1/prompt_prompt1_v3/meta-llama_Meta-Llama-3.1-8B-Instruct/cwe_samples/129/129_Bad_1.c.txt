VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The code reads data from a socket into a fixed-size buffer (buf) without checking the size of the incoming data, allowing a potential attacker to send more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a fixed-size buffer (buf) to read data from the socket. However, it does not check the size of the incoming data before reading it into the buffer. This means that if an attacker sends more data than the buffer can hold, it will overflow the buffer, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a dynamic buffer size or check the size of the incoming data before reading it into the buffer. This can be achieved by using a function like recv() that allows the caller to specify the maximum size of the buffer. Additionally, the code should validate the incoming data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. For example, it could check that the data consists of exactly two integers separated by a space. If the data does not conform to the expected format, the code should
