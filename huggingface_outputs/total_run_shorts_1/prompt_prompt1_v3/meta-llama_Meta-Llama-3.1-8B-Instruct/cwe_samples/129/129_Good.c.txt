 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet checks if the array index is within the valid range, preventing an out-of-bounds error.
EXPLANATION: 
The code checks if the index is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the array. This ensures that the index is within the valid range, preventing an out-of-bounds error. This is a good practice to prevent common programming errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code is already correct. However, it's worth noting that a more concise way to write this condition would be to use the "less than" operator directly, like this: if (index < len). The extra check for index >= 0 is not necessary.
