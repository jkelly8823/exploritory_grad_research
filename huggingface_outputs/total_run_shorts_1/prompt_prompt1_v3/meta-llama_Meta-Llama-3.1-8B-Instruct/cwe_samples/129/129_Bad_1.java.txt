 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. An attacker can provide a negative value for the list size, which will cause the program to allocate a large array, allowing the attacker to potentially overflow the array and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: 
The code allocates an array of Widget objects based on the provided list size. However, it does not perform any bounds checking on the array index. If an attacker provides a negative value for the list size, the program will allocate an array of a large size, potentially allowing the attacker to overflow the array and execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Validate the list size to ensure it is a non-negative integer.
2. Use a safe array allocation method, such as using an ArrayList or a dynamically-sized array.
3. Implement bounds checking on the array index to prevent buffer overflow attacks. 
4. Consider using a secure coding library or framework to handle array allocation and bounds checking. 5. Avoid using die() function, instead use a more secure way to handle errors. 6. Consider using a secure way to handle user input, such as sanitizing or validating the input before
