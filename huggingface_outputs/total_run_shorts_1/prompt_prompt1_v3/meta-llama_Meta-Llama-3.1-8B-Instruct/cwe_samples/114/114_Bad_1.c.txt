 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a DLL hijacking attack. This occurs when an attacker replaces the legitimate DLL with a malicious one, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the LoadLibrary function to load a DLL, but it does not specify the full path to the DLL. This allows an attacker to replace the legitimate DLL with a malicious one, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should load the DLL using the full path, such as LoadLibrary("C:\\path\\to\\liberty.dll");. This ensures that the code loads the legitimate DLL and prevents an attacker from replacing it with a malicious one. Alternatively, the code can use a secure method to load the DLL, such as using the Windows API's LoadLibraryEx function with the LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR flag. This flag tells Windows to only search for the DLL in the application's directory, preventing an attacker from replacing the DLL with a malicious one.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
