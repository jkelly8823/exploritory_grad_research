VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of strcpy and strcat functions. The buffer size is not checked before copying data into it, making it susceptible to overflow attacks.
EXPLANATION: The code uses strcpy and strcat functions to concatenate strings without checking the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the destination buffer, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The use of strcpy and strcat is generally discouraged in favor of safer functions like strcpy_s and strcat_s, or using the strncat function with a fixed buffer size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the strcpy and strcat functions with safer alternatives, such as strcpy_s and strcat_s, or use strncat with a fixed buffer size to prevent buffer overflow. Additionally, consider using a safer method to concatenate strings, such as using the snprintf function or a modern string library like std::string. The LoadLibrary function should also be called with a fixed buffer size to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks. The variable 'lib' should be freed after use to prevent memory leaks.  ```c
free(lib);
``` should be added at the end of the
