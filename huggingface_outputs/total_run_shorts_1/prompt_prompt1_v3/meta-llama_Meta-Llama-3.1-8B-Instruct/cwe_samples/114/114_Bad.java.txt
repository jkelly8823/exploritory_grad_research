VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in the current working directory and the application will load it instead of the intended library.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet loads a library from the current working directory using System.loadLibrary(). This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL file in the current working directory and the application will load it instead of the intended library. This is a classic example of DLL hijacking.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a full path to the library, or use a library loading mechanism that is less susceptible to DLL hijacking, such as using a manifest file to specify the library. For example, you can use System.LoadLibrary with the full path to the library, like this: System.LoadLibrary("C:\\path\\to\\library.dll"). Alternatively, you can use a library loading mechanism that is less susceptible to DLL hijacking, such as using a manifest file to specify the library. This can be done using the assembly:loaderOptimization attribute in the project file, or by using the LoadLibraryEx function with the LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE flag.  The LoadLibraryEx function with
