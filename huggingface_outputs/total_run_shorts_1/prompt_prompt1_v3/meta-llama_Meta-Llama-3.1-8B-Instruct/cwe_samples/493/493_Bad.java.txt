 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of the LookupPrice function, which may be using user input without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The LookupPrice function is called with a string parameter "MyWidgetType", which may be user input. If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The LookupPrice function should be reviewed to ensure it properly sanitizes user input. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to retrieve the price, such as a database query with proper input validation.  The LookupPrice function should be replaced with a more secure method to retrieve the price.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized before being used in any database queries.  Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection attacks.  The code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is secure and free from vulnerabilities.  Consider using a code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.  The
