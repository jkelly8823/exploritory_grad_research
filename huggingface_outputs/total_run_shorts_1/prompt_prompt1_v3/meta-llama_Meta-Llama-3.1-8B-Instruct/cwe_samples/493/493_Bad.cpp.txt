VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. An attacker could manipulate the configPath variable to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The configPath variable is set to a hardcoded path. This makes it vulnerable to path traversal attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the path to access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. For example, if the attacker sets the configPath to "/etc/application/../etc/passwd", they could access the /etc/passwd file.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the configPath variable should be validated and sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a library that provides path validation and sanitization, such as the Path class in Java. The configPath variable should also be set to a secure default value, such as a path within the application's own directory. Additionally, the application should be configured to use a secure configuration file format, such as JSON or XML, which is less prone to path traversal attacks.  The application should also be configured to use a secure configuration file location, such as a directory within the application's own directory, rather than a system-wide
