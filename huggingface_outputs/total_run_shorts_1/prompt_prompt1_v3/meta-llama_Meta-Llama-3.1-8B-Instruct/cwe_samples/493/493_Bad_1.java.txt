VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability is present due to the use of a String constructor with a string literal. This can lead to a potential security issue if the string is used in a way that allows an attacker to manipulate the path.
EXPLANATION: The String constructor is used to create a new string object from a string literal. However, this can lead to a potential security issue if the string is used in a way that allows an attacker to manipulate the path. For example, if the string is used in a file path, an attacker could manipulate the path to access sensitive files. This is because the String constructor does not perform any validation on the input string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a constant string instead of a String constructor. For example, you can define a constant string at the top of the file and use that instead of creating a new string object. This will prevent any potential security issues. Alternatively, you can use a Path object from the java.nio.file package, which provides a more secure way to work with file paths.  ```java
public static final String CONFIG_PATH = "/etc/application/config.dat";
```  or  ```java
