VULNERABLE_LINES: 108, 109
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential division by zero error when the input value 'z' is zero.
EXPLANATION: The function rec_float() contains a division operation where it divides 1500.0 by 'z'. If 'z' is zero, this operation will result in a division by zero error. Additionally, the function rec_float() also contains a division operation where it divides the result of the first division by 'y'. If 'y' is also zero, this operation will also result in a division by zero error. This could potentially cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can add a check to ensure that 'z' is not zero before performing the division operation. You can also add a check to ensure that 'y' is not zero before performing the division operation. This can be done using a simple if statement to check the values of 'z' and 'y' before performing the division. For example, you can add the following code before the division operation: if z != 0 && y != 0 { ... } else { ...
