VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code contains a potential division by zero vulnerability. The `rec_big` function uses the `z` parameter in a division operation. However, if `z` is zero, this will cause a division by zero error.
EXPLANATION: This code appears to be a recursive function designed to perform some mathematical calculation. The `rec_big` function takes two `BigRational` parameters, `y` and `z`, and returns a `BigRational` value. However, in the line `BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(1500)) / z`, the code divides by `z`, which can be zero. This can cause a division by zero error, which is a serious vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that `z` is not zero before performing the division. You can use the `is_zero()` method provided by the `BigRational` type to check if `z` is zero. If `z` is zero, you can return an error or handle it in some other way. Here is an example of how you
