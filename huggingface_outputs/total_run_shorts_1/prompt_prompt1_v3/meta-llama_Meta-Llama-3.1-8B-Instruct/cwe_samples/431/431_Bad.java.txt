VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential DNS Rebinding Attack
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a DNS Rebinding Attack. This is because the code is using the `getRemoteAddr()` method to get the client's IP address, and then using the `getByName()` method to resolve the hostname from the IP address. An attacker could potentially manipulate the DNS records to point the hostname to a different IP address, allowing them to bypass security restrictions. This is a classic example of a DNS Rebinding Attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the `getLocalAddr()` method instead of `getRemoteAddr()`, which returns the server's IP address instead of the client's. Additionally, the code should validate the IP address to ensure it is not a private IP address or a loopback address. This can be done by checking if the IP address starts with `10.`, `172.16.`, `192.168.`, or `127.`. If the IP address is not valid, the code should return an error message or handle it accordingly. The code should also consider using a more secure method to resolve the hostname,
