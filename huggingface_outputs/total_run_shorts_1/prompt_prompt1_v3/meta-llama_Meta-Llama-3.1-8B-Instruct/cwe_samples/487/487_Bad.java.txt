 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the incorrect usage of the keyword "Static" in the declaration of the method "youAreHidingThisFunction". The correct keyword to use is "static" instead of "Static".
EXPLANATION: The keyword "Static" is not a valid keyword in Java. The correct keyword to use is "static" which is used to declare a static method. This is a syntax error and can cause the code to fail to compile.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the keyword "Static" with the correct keyword "static" in the method declaration. The corrected method declaration should be: "public static String youAreHidingThisFunction(functionToIntegrate)".  Additionally, the method name "youAreHidingThisFunction" is not following the conventional camelCase naming convention in Java. It should be renamed to a more descriptive and conventional name.  The corrected method declaration should be: "public static String integrateFunction(functionToIntegrate)".  The corrected code snippet should be: "public class Lebesgue implements Integration{ public static String integrateFunction(functionToIntegrate){ return...; }}"  The corrected code snippet should be:
