VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function getName() returns a pointer to a local variable name, which is a buffer on the stack. When the function returns, this buffer is destroyed, and the returned pointer becomes a dangling pointer. This can lead to undefined behavior when the returned pointer is used.
EXPLANATION: The function getName() is returning a pointer to a local variable name. When the function returns, the local variable name is destroyed, and the returned pointer becomes a dangling pointer. This can lead to undefined behavior when the returned pointer is used. This is a classic example of a dangling pointer vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function getName() should return a copy of the string instead of returning a pointer to the local variable. This can be achieved by changing the return type to std::string and returning the string directly. Alternatively, the function can allocate memory on the heap using malloc or new and return a pointer to that memory. However, this would require the caller to free the memory when it is no longer needed to avoid a memory leak. A better approach would be to use a smart pointer like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr to manage
