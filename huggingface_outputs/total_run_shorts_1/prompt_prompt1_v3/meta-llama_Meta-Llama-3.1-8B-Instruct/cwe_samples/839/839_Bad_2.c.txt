VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. When the index is invalid, the code attempts to access the array at the invalid index, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the index is less than the length of the array, but it does not check if the index is within the bounds of the array. If the index is invalid, the code attempts to access the array at the invalid index, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the index is within the bounds of the array before attempting to access it. This can be done by checking if the index is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the array. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the index is invalid by returning an error value or throwing an exception. The corrected code should look like this:```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    if (index >= 0 && index < len) {
        return array[index];
    } else
