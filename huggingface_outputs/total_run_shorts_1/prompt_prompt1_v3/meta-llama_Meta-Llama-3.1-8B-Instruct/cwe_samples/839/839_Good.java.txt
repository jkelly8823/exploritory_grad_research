VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential integer overflow when withdrawing an amount that is greater than the maximum withdrawal limit. This is because the withdrawal amount is a double, but the minimum and maximum withdrawal limits are integers. If the withdrawal amount is a large number, it could potentially exceed the maximum integer value, causing an integer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the withdrawal amount is a double, but the minimum and maximum withdrawal limits are integers. When a large withdrawal amount is passed to the withdraw method, it could potentially exceed the maximum integer value, causing an integer overflow. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the minimum and maximum withdrawal limits should be changed to doubles to match the type of the withdrawal amount. This would prevent the potential integer overflow and ensure that the program behaves correctly even when large withdrawal amounts are passed. Alternatively, the withdrawal amount could be cast to an integer before comparing it to the minimum and maximum withdrawal limits, but this would also introduce the risk of losing precision if the withdrawal amount is a large number.  The best approach would be to change the type of the minimum and
