VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (headers) to store a dynamically-sized number of PacketHeader objects.
EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory for the headers array using malloc, but the size of the array is calculated using the numHeaders variable, which is obtained from the packet object. However, the packet object's headers field is not checked for validity, and it is possible that it contains a value greater than the actual number of headers, leading to a buffer overflow when the headers array is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the validity of the numHeaders value before allocating memory for the headers array. This can be done by checking if numHeaders is within a valid range (e.g., 0 to 100) before the allocation. Additionally, the code should use a dynamically-sized data structure, such as a vector or an array with a variable size, to store the PacketHeader objects. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability. 

Note: The code snippet is missing a semicolon at the end of the line where the headers array is allocated. This is not
