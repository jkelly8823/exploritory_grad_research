VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The class urlTool extends Applet, which is a deprecated class. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and should be avoided.
EXPLANATION: The Applet class is a legacy class that was used for applets in the early days of Java. However, it has been deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. Using this class can lead to security vulnerabilities and should be avoided. It is recommended to use the JApplet class instead, but even that is deprecated. A better approach would be to use a modern GUI framework such as Swing or JavaFX.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the Applet class with a modern GUI framework such as Swing or JavaFX. If you must use the Applet class, consider using a wrapper class to handle the deprecated methods. However, this is not recommended. It is also recommended to update the Java version to a version that does not have the Applet class.
