VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack because it directly concatenates user input into a string that is used to log information. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `getParameter` method to retrieve user input from the request, which is then concatenated into a string using the `+` operator. This is a common pattern for SQL injection attacks, as it allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input string. In this case, the input string is used to log information, but it could potentially be used to execute malicious SQL code if the logger is not properly configured.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a parameterized query or a prepared statement to separate the user input from the SQL code. This can be achieved by using a logging framework that supports parameterized queries, such as Log4j or Logback. Alternatively, the code could use a string formatting library, such as String.format, to insert the user input into the log message in a safe and controlled manner. For example: `logger.info("User's street address: {}", request.getParameter("street
