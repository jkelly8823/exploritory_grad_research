 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack due to the lack of input validation on the startDate and endDate parameters.
EXPLANATION: 
The setStartDate and setEndDate methods allow any string to be assigned to the startDate and endDate fields, respectively. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the startDate or endDate strings. For example, if the code is using these fields to construct a SQL query, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code by setting the startDate or endDate to something like " OR 1=1 --".
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate the input to the startDate and endDate fields to ensure they conform to the expected format.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in input validation and sanitization features. 4. Avoid directly concatenating user input into SQL queries. 5. Consider using an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool that can help prevent SQL injection attacks. 6. Use prepared statements or stored procedures to execute SQL queries. 7. Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure. 8. Consider
