VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The password for the database connection is hardcoded in the code, which is a security risk. This allows anyone with access to the code to access the database.
EXPLANATION: Hardcoding passwords in code is a common security vulnerability. It allows unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as database credentials. In this case, the password "password" is hardcoded in the connectionString attribute of the add element. This makes it easy for an attacker to access the database by simply accessing the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the password should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure secrets management system. This way, the password is not hardcoded in the code and is not accessible to unauthorized users. Additionally, consider using a more secure connection string format, such as using a connection string builder to separate the connection string from the password.  The password should be replaced with a placeholder, such as a secure token, and then replaced with the actual password at runtime. This way, the password is not stored in the code and is not accessible to unauthorized users.  Consider using a secure password manager to store the password securely.  Consider using a
