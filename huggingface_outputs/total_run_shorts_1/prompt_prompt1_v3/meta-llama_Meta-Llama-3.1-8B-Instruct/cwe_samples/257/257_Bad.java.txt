VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a time-dependent comparison in the VerifyAdmin function. This is because the compress function is called on the password before comparing it with the stored compressed password, allowing an attacker to measure the time it takes to compress the password and potentially infer the password.
EXPLANATION: The VerifyAdmin function is designed to verify an admin's password. However, the function uses a time-dependent comparison by calling the compress function on the password before comparing it with the stored compressed password. This allows an attacker to measure the time it takes to compress the password, which can potentially reveal information about the password. For example, if the password is short, it will take less time to compress than a longer password. This can be exploited in a timing attack to infer the password.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a constant-time comparison method, such as using a hash function to compare the password with the stored hash. This will prevent an attacker from measuring the time it takes to compress the password and make the comparison more secure. One possible solution is to use the SHA-256 hash function to
