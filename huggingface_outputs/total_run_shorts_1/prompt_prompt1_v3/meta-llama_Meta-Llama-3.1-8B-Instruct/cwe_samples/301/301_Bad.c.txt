VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function generate_password_and_cmd() is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The variable password_and_cmd is not checked for its length before being passed to the simple_digest() function, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input is too long.
EXPLANATION: The simple_digest() function expects the length of the input buffer to be passed as the third argument, but in the generate_password_and_cmd() function, the length of the password_and_cmd string is not passed. Instead, the strlen() function is called on the password variable, which is not the intended input buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the password variable is too long, causing the simple_digest() function to write beyond the bounds of the ret buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The generate_password_and_cmd() function should be modified to pass the correct length of the password_and_cmd string to the simple_digest() function. This can be done by replacing the strlen(password) with strlen(password_and_cmd) in the simple_digest() function call. Additionally, the simple_digest() function should be modified to check the length of the input buffer before passing it to the EVP_DigestUpdate()
