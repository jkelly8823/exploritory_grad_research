VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a race condition. The thread is started twice, once by calling the run() method directly and once by calling the start() method. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes.
EXPLANATION: 
The run() method is called directly on the thread object, which can cause the thread to start executing immediately. However, the start() method is also called, which is intended to start the thread in a separate thread of control. This can lead to a race condition where the thread is started twice, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Remove the call to the run() method directly on the thread object. This will ensure that the thread is started correctly using the start() method.
2. Call the start() method on the thread object to start the thread in a separate thread of control. This will prevent the thread from being started twice. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the start() method call, which is why the vulnerability is present. If the start() method call was present, the vulnerability would not be present.  The code snippet is also missing the implementation of the
