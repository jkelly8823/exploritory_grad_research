VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a logical error due to the incorrect use of bitwise operators. The intention is to check if a user has both read and write access, but the current implementation will incorrectly return true if the user has either read or write access.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the line where the mask is calculated using the bitwise AND operator (&). This will result in a mask that only has the write bit set, effectively ignoring the read bit. The correct operator to use in this case is the bitwise OR operator (|), which would result in a mask that has both the read and write bits set. This would correctly identify users with both read and write access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the bitwise AND operator (&) with the bitwise OR operator (|) in the line where the mask is calculated. The corrected line should read: unsigned int mask = BIT_READ | BIT_WRITE;. Additionally, consider using a more descriptive variable name instead of "mask" to improve code readability.
