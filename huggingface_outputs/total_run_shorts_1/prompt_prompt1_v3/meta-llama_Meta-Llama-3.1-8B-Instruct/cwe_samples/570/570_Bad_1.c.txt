VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (productName) to store a dynamically-sized string (product name).
EXPLANATION: The productName array is declared with a fixed size of 128 characters. However, the getProductName function is not shown, but it is likely that it returns a dynamically-sized string. If the product name is longer than 127 characters, it will overflow the productName array, potentially causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a dynamically-sized buffer or a string class that can handle variable-length strings. Alternatively, ensure that the getProductName function returns a string with a maximum length that is safe for the productName array. Additionally, consider using a safer function to copy the string, such as strncpy, to prevent buffer overflows.
