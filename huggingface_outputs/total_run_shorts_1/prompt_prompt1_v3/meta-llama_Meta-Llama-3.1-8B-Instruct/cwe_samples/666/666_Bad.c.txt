VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double free vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a double free vulnerability. The pointer `ptr` is first freed in the `if (abrt)` block, and then again outside of it. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or memory corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the second `free(ptr)` statement to prevent the double free vulnerability. The correct code should only free the pointer once, when it is no longer needed. The corrected code should look like this: `if (abrt) { free(ptr); }...` or `free(ptr);...` depending on the desired behavior.
