VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to predictable random number generation. The use of `os.urandom(2)` to seed the PRNG is insufficient as it only generates 2 bytes of randomness, which is not enough to ensure randomness. Additionally, the use of `random.seed(a=seed)` with a fixed seed value can lead to predictable random numbers.
EXPLANATION: The `os.urandom(2)` function generates only 2 bytes of randomness, which is not sufficient to seed the PRNG. A good random number generator should use a sufficient amount of randomness to ensure unpredictability. In this case, using `os.urandom(16)` would be more suitable. Furthermore, using a fixed seed value with `random.seed(a=seed)` can lead to predictable random numbers. It is recommended to use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) like `secrets` module in Python.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use `os.urandom(16)` to generate a sufficient amount of randomness to seed the PRNG.
2. Use a CSPRNG like `secrets` module in Python to generate
