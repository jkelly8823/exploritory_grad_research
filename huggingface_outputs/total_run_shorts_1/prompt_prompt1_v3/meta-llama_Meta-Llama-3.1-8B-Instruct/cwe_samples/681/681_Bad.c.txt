VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function readdata() returns an unsigned int, but it can return a negative value (-1) when an error occurs.
EXPLANATION: The function readdata() is declared to return an unsigned int, which means it can only return non-negative values. However, when an error occurs, the function sets the variable amount to -1, which is a negative value. This can cause issues when the returned value is used in the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function readdata() should be modified to return a signed int instead of an unsigned int, or the variable amount should be set to a non-negative value when an error occurs. For example, amount could be set to 0 or a specific error code. Alternatively, the function could be modified to throw an exception when an error occurs, rather than returning an error code.  ```c
                  int readdata () {int amount = 0;...if (result == ERROR)amount = -1;...return amount;}
                  ``` or ```c
                  unsigned int readdata () {int amount = 0;...if (result == ERROR)throw std::runtime_error("
