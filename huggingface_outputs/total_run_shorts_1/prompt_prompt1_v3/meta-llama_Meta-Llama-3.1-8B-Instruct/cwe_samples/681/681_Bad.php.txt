VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to integer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to cast a float value to an integer and then adds it to another integer. However, the float value 1.8345 is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an integer in PHP, which is 2147483647. When this value is cast to an integer, it will be truncated to 1, resulting in an integer overflow when added to $intVal.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a data type that can handle the full range of values, such as a float or a string. Alternatively, use a library that can handle arbitrary-precision arithmetic. In this case, you could use the bcadd function from the BC Math extension to add the two values. For example: $result = bcadd((string)$floatVal, $intVal, 10);. This will add the two values with a precision of 10 decimal places.
