VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a stack overflow attack due to the use of alloca() to dynamically allocate memory on the stack. alloca() allocates memory on the stack, which can lead to a stack overflow if the allocated memory exceeds the stack size.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses alloca() to dynamically allocate memory on the stack. alloca() is a non-standard function that is not supported by all compilers. It allocates memory on the stack, which can lead to a stack overflow if the allocated memory exceeds the stack size. In this code snippet, the memory allocated by alloca() is not freed, which can cause a memory leak. The loop iterates end_limit times, which can potentially lead to a stack overflow if end_limit is large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Avoid using alloca() to dynamically allocate memory on the stack. Instead, use standard memory allocation functions like malloc() or new to allocate memory on the heap. Free the allocated memory when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Consider using a stack size limiter to prevent stack overflows. If alloca() is necessary, use it with caution and
