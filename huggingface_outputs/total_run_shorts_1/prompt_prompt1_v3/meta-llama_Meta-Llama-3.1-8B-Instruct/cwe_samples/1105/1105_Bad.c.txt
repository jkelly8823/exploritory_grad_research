VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A null pointer dereference is possible due to the pointer arithmetic on a pointer to a local variable. When the function returns, the local variable will be destroyed, leaving the pointer pointing to invalid memory.
EXPLANATION: 
The expression *(&a + 1) attempts to access the memory location one byte after the local variable a. However, since a is a local variable, its memory location will be destroyed when the function returns. This means that the pointer *(&a + 1) will be pointing to invalid memory, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Avoid using pointer arithmetic on pointers to local variables. Instead, consider using dynamic memory allocation using operators like new or malloc. If the code is designed to run in a specific scope, consider using static variables instead of local variables. If the code is not intended to run in a specific scope, consider re-designing the code to avoid using local variables.  Also, consider using a safer form of pointer arithmetic that takes into account the size of the type being pointed to. In this case, using sizeof(char) is safe, but in general, it
