VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Format string vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The format string vulnerability occurs when user-controlled input is used as a format string in a printf function. In this case, the format string is controlled by the user, and the format specifiers are not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use printf with a fixed format string or use a safer function like printf with a format string that has been validated. For example, use printf("%d %d %d %d\n", 5, 9, 5, 9); instead of printf("%d %d %1$d %1$d\n", 5, 9);. Additionally, consider using a safer function like snprintf or sprintf to prevent buffer overflows. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("%d %d %1$d %1$d\n", 5, 9);
    return 0;
}
