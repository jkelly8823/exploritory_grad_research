VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This is a buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The `snprintf` function is not being used correctly. The `snprintf` function is designed to prevent buffer overflows by writing at most `size` bytes to the buffer. However, in this case, the `size` parameter is set to 128, but the `fmt` parameter is set to `argv[1]`, which could potentially be longer than 128 characters. This means that if `argv[1]` is longer than 128 characters, the buffer will overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the `strlen` function to get the length of `argv[1]` and pass this length as the `size` parameter to `snprintf`. This will prevent the buffer from overflowing. Additionally, consider using a safer function such as `asprintf` to avoid buffer overflows altogether. For example: `snprintf(buf, strlen(argv[1]) + 1, argv[1]);` or `asprintf(&buf, "%s", argv[1]);`.
