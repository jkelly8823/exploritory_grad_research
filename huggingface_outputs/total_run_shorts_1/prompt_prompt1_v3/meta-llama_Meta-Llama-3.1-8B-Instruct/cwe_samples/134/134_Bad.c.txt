VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from `argv[1]` into the `buf` array without checking the length of the data. If the length of the data is greater than the size of the `buf` array, it can overflow the buffer, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the data before copying it into the `buf` array. This can be done using the `strlen` function to get the length of the string and then using `memcpy` to copy only the necessary amount of data. Additionally, the code should check for buffer overflows when printing the string using `printWrapper`. This can be done by using `snprintf` instead of `printf` to ensure that the string is not too long. The corrected code should look like this:
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char buf[5012];
    int len = strlen(argv[1]);
    if (len > 5012)
