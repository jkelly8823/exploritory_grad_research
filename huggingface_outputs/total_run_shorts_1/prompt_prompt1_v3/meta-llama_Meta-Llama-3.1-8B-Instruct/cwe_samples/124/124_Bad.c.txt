VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A double free bug is present in this function. When a call to the function is made, a memory block is allocated with malloc(). However, the allocated memory block is then assigned to a local variable, and then a new memory block is allocated with malloc() and assigned to the return value of the function. This means that when the function returns, two memory blocks are allocated, but only one is deallocated, leaving the other memory block dangling. This can lead to undefined behavior when the dangling memory block is accessed.
EXPLANATION: This is an example of a double free bug, which occurs when a memory block is freed twice. In this case, the memory block allocated with malloc() is freed when the function returns, but the memory block is also still accessible through the retMessage variable. This can lead to undefined behavior when the dangling memory block is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only one memory block is allocated and deallocated. We can do this by removing the second call to malloc() and assigning the value of message to retMessage. Here is the corrected code: char* trimTr
