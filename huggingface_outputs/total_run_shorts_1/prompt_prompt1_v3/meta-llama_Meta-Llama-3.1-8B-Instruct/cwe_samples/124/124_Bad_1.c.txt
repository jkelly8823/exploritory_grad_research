VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of strcpy with user-controlled input. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the destination buffer (destBuf) is not checked for sufficient space before copying data into it.
EXPLANATION: The use of strcpy is problematic because it does not perform any bounds checking on the destination buffer. This means that if the user-controlled input (srcBuf) is longer than the remaining space in the destination buffer, it will overflow the buffer and potentially lead to a security exploit. Additionally, the line "int idx = result - destBuf;" calculates the index of the "Replace Me" string in the destination buffer, but it does not account for the possibility that the string may not be found, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if the strcpy function is called with a null pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function like strncpy or strcpy_s, which perform bounds checking on the destination buffer. Alternatively, the code could use a manual loop to copy the data, checking the bounds of the destination buffer at each iteration. Additionally, the code should check if the
