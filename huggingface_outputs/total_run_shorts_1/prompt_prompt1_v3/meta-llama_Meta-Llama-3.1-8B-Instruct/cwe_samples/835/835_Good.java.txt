VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for the case where rateSold is greater than or equal to 1, but less than 0. This could potentially lead to incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if rateSold is less than 1, but it does not check for the case where rateSold is greater than or equal to 1, but less than 0. This could potentially lead to incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check for the case where rateSold is greater than or equal to 1, but less than 0. This can be done by adding an additional condition to the if statement. For example: if (rateSold < 1 || rateSold >= 0) {return isReorder;} . Alternatively, the condition can be rewritten as if (rateSold < 0) {return isReorder;}. This will ensure that the code correctly handles all possible values of rateSold. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
