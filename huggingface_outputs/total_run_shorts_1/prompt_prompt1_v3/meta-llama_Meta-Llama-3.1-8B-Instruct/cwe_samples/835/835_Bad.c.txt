VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a timeout on the socket connection. This allows an attacker to keep the socket open indefinitely, consuming system resources and potentially causing a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a do-while loop to repeatedly attempt to establish a connection to the server. However, it does not set a timeout for the socket connection, which means that if the server is not responding or is down, the socket will remain open indefinitely. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where an attacker can keep the socket open and consume system resources, potentially causing the system to become unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should set a timeout for the socket connection using the setsockopt function. You can set the SO_RCVTIMEO option to specify the timeout for receiving data, and the SO_SNDTIMEO option to specify the timeout for sending data. For example: `setsockopt(servsock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, (struct timeval *)&timeout, sizeof(timeout));` where `timeout` is a timeval structure containing the
