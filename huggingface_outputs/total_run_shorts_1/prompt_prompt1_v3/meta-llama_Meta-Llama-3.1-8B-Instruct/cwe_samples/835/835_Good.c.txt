VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a proper error handling mechanism for the connect() system call. If the connect() call fails, the code will enter an infinite loop, causing the program to consume increasing amounts of CPU and memory.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a busy-waiting approach to retry the connect() call, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack if an attacker intentionally causes the connect() call to fail. This can be exploited by an attacker to consume system resources and potentially cause the program to crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to implement a proper error handling mechanism for the connect() call. This can be achieved by using a timeout or a retry mechanism with a limited number of attempts, and by checking the return value of the connect() call to determine if the connection was successful. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the connect() call fails, and to prevent the program from entering an infinite loop. For example, the code could use a select() call to wait for
