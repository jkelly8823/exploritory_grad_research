VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of scanf() to read user input without checking the maximum allowed input length.
EXPLANATION: The scanf() function does not perform any bounds checking on the input, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer allocated for the board dimensions. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use fgets() or gets() to read user input, and check the length of the input before allocating memory. Alternatively, use a safer function like sscanf() with a fixed format string and a buffer size limit. Additionally, consider using a library like libmagic to detect the type of input and prevent buffer overflows.  Also, consider using a safer way to allocate memory, such as using a memory pool or a library like jemalloc.  Finally, consider using a safer way to handle errors, such as using a library like error.h.  It is also recommended to check the return value of malloc() to ensure that the memory allocation was successful.  It is also recommended to use a safer way to handle the board dimensions, such as using a struct to represent the dimensions
