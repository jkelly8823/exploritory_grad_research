VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability due to the use of user input in a database query without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the `getAttribute` method to retrieve user input, which is then used to calculate the total price. However, this input is not sanitized or validated, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the user input before using it in the calculation. This can be achieved by using a library like OWASP ESAPI to validate the input and prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using a parameterized query or prepared statement to separate the SQL code from the user input. This will help prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure the security of the application.
