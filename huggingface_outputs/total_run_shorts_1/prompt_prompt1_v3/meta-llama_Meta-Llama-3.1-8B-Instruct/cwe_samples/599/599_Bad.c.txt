 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns a pointer to an X509 structure, which can be NULL if no certificate is present. The code snippet does not check for this possibility before attempting to use the returned pointer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the SSL_get_peer_certificate function to retrieve a pointer to an X509 structure representing the peer's certificate. However, this function can return NULL if no certificate is present. The code snippet then attempts to use this pointer without checking if it is NULL, which can lead to a null pointer dereference. This is a potential security vulnerability because it can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code snippet should check the return value of SSL_get_peer_certificate to ensure that it is not NULL before attempting to use the returned pointer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the pointer is NULL before proceeding. For example: if (cert!= NULL) {... } else {... } This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure that the program behaves correctly
