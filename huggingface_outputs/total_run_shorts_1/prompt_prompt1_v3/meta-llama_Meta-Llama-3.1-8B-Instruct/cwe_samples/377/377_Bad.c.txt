VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a temporary file creation vulnerability. This is because the tmpnam_r function is used to generate a temporary filename, but the file is not properly closed in case of an error. This can lead to a temporary file being left behind on the system.
EXPLANATION: The tmpnam_r function is used to generate a temporary filename, but the file is not properly closed in case of an error. This can lead to a temporary file being left behind on the system. The file is opened with fopen, but there is no corresponding fclose call in case of an error. This can lead to a temporary file being left behind on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to properly close the file in case of an error. This can be done by adding a fclose call after the while loop, and also by checking the return value of fopen to ensure that the file was opened successfully. For example: if (fopen(filename,"wb+") == NULL) { /* handle error */ } else { /* rest of the code */ } and fclose(tmp); after the while loop. 

Note: The tmpnam_r function is used
