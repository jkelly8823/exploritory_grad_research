VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential divide-by-zero error. The code checks if `exponent_reg` is not equal to 'd0, but it does not check if `exponent_reg` is equal to 0. This could lead to a division by zero error when calculating the result.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the code does not account for the case where `exponent_reg` is equal to 0. In digital logic, division by zero is undefined and can cause the system to enter an undefined state. This can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, and even crashes. To mitigate this risk, the code should be modified to handle the case where `exponent_reg` is equal to 0.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if `exponent_reg` is equal to 0 before performing any division operations. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if `exponent_reg` is equal to 0, and if so, handle it accordingly. For example: `if (exponent_reg == 'd0) begin ... end
