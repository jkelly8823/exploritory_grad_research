VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it directly uses the user-provided input from the "reportName" parameter to construct the file path. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input to access files outside of the intended directory, leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a validated and sanitized input for the file path. This can be achieved by using a library like Apache Commons Lang to validate the input and prevent directory traversal. Alternatively, use a more secure approach like using a File.separator to construct the file path. For example: File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/", request.getParameter("reportName")); would not be secure, but using File.separator would be: File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + File.separator + request.getParameter("reportName")); is still not secure, a better approach would be to use a validated and sanitized input, or to use a more secure approach like using a Path object from the java.nio.file package.  File rFile = Paths.get("/usr/local/apfr
