VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a file path traversal attack. An attacker could manipulate the "sub" property in the configuration file to read arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The code reads a file from a user-controlled location using a FileInputStream. The file path is constructed by concatenating the "sub" property from the configuration file with ".txt". An attacker could manipulate the "sub" property to read files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a Path object to construct the file path, and use the Files.readAllBytes method to read the file. This will prevent the file path traversal attack. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to read the configuration file, such as using a Properties object with a secure configuration file location. For example: Path filePath = Paths.get(cfg.getProperty("sub") + ".txt"); byte[] arr = Files.readAllBytes(filePath); out.println(arr);. 

Note: The code snippet is missing variable declarations and import statements, but this does not affect the analysis.
