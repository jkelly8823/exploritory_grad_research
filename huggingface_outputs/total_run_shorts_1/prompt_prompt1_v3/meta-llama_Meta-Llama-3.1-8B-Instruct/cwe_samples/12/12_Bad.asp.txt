VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to an error message disclosure attack. The customErrors mode is set to "Off", which allows the server to display detailed error messages to users. This can potentially expose sensitive information about the application's internal workings, such as database connection strings or other configuration details.
EXPLANATION: The customErrors mode is used to control how the server handles errors. Setting it to "Off" means that the server will display detailed error messages, including the error code, error message, and any additional information that may be available. This can be useful for debugging purposes, but it also poses a security risk if the application is exposed to the public. An attacker could potentially use this information to launch a targeted attack on the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Set the customErrors mode to "On" or "RemoteOnly" to prevent the disclosure of error messages. This will ensure that the server only displays a generic error message to users, without revealing sensitive information about the application. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as logging and monitoring, to detect and respond to potential security threats.  The server should also be configured to display a custom error page
