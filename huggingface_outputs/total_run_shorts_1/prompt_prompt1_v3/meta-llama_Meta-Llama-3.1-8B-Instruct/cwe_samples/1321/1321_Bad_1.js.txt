VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the prototype of an object to inject properties that will be inherited by all objects created from that prototype.
EXPLANATION: 
The `setValueByPath` function is being called with an object that is not being cloned or frozen, allowing an attacker to modify the original object's prototype. This can lead to prototype pollution, where an attacker can inject properties into the prototype chain, potentially allowing them to access sensitive information or manipulate the behavior of objects created from that prototype.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use `Object.create(null)` to create a new object with a null prototype, preventing prototype pollution.
2. Use `Object.freeze` to freeze the object being passed to `setValueByPath`, preventing it from being modified.
3. Use a library or function that is designed to handle prototype pollution, such as `lodash.set` or `immutable.js`. 
4. Avoid using `setValueByPath` with an object that is not being cloned or frozen, as this can lead to prototype pollution. 
5. Consider using a more secure method of setting values on objects, such as using a library like
