VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks. An attacker could manipulate the path parameter to inject arbitrary properties into the object.
EXPLANATION: The function setValueByPath is designed to set a value in an object based on a given path. However, the function does not validate the path parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to inject arbitrary properties into the object. This is a classic example of a prototype pollution attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to validate the path parameter to ensure it does not contain any malicious properties. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach, where only a specific set of allowed properties are accepted. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle errors and exceptions properly to prevent unexpected behavior. A more robust approach would be to use a library or framework that provides built-in support for safe object manipulation.  It is also worth noting that this code is vulnerable to another issue, the function will create an empty object if the path is not found, this could potentially cause issues if the object is used later in the code.  This could be fixed by checking if the object exists
