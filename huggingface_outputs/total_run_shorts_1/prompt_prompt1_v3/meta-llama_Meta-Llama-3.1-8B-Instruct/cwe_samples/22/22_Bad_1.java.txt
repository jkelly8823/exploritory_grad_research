VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path traversal vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `getInputPath()` method is not validated, and the `startsWith()` method is used to check if the path starts with "/safe_dir/". However, an attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to traverse outside of the intended directory by using directory traversal techniques such as ".." or "/../". This could lead to unintended file deletion.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input path to ensure it only contains the intended directory. This can be done by using a regular expression to match the path against a whitelist of allowed directories. Additionally, the `delete()` method should be avoided and instead use a more secure method to delete files, such as using the `Files.delete()` method from the Java NIO API. The `getInputPath()` method should also be reviewed to ensure it does not return a path that can be manipulated by an attacker.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not have any other potential vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to use a try-catch block to
