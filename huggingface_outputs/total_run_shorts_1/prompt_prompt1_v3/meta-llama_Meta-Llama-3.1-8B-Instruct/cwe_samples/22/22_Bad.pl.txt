VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. An attacker could manipulate the username parameter to access arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a user-provided value ($username) to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path by injecting special characters, such as../, to access files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a path validation library or function to ensure that the constructed path is within the intended directory. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to read the file, such as using a try-catch block to handle potential errors. For example, you could use the File::Spec module to join the directory and filename safely, like this: my $profilePath = File::Spec->catfile($dataPath, $username);. This will prevent an attacker from manipulating the path to access arbitrary files.
