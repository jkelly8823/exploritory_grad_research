VULNERABLE_LINES: 34-35
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack. This is because the `filename` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code by manipulating the `Content-Disposition` header.
EXPLANATION: The `filename` variable is extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious code. This can lead to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attack, where the attacker can include arbitrary files on the server. The `filename` variable is not properly sanitized, making it vulnerable to such attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `filename` variable should be properly sanitized by using a whitelist approach to validate the input. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to match the expected filename pattern. Additionally, the `UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING` constant should be validated to ensure it is not vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` objects should also be closed in a finally block to ensure they are properly closed even if an exception is thrown. 

Note: The `UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING` constant is
