VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. This is because the filename is obtained from an external source (System.getProperty) and is used directly to create a File object without any sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The System.getProperty method can return a string that contains directory traversal characters (e.g.,..\ or /../) which can be used to access files outside of the intended directory. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the filename should be sanitized and validated before creating the File object. This can be done by using a library like Apache Commons Lang to remove directory traversal characters from the filename. Alternatively, the filename can be constructed manually using a Path object from the java.nio.file package, which provides a safer way to build file paths. For example: Path path = Paths.get("path", "to", "dictionaryFile"); File dictionaryFile = path.toFile();.
