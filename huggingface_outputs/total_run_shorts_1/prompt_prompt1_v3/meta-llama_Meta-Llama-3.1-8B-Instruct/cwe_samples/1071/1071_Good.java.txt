VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Division by zero vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to divide by zero, which is undefined in mathematics and can cause a runtime error. The catch block attempts to handle the exception but does not prevent the division by zero from occurring in the first place.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the divisor (b) is checked for zero before attempting division. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check for zero. For example, `if (b == 0) { log.error("Divided by zero detected, setting to -1."); c = -1; } else { c = a / b; }` This will prevent the division by zero from occurring and avoid the potential runtime error. Alternatively, consider using a try-catch block that catches the `ArithmeticException` exception, but also includes a check for the divisor being zero before attempting division. For example, `if (b != 0) { try { c = a / b; } catch (ArithmeticException ae) { log.error("Divided by zero detected, setting to -1."); c = -1;
