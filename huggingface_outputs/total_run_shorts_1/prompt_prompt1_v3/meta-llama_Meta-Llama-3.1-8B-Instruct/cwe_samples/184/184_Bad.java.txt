VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This is because it uses the `replaceAll()` method to replace the string "script" with the user-controlled input `mask`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
EXPLANATION: The `replaceAll()` method is not suitable for replacing user-controlled input, as it does not properly sanitize the input. An attacker can inject malicious code by providing a `mask` value that contains a JavaScript function or other malicious code. This can lead to a range of security issues, including the execution of arbitrary code on the client-side.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to replace the string "script", such as the `replace()` method. Additionally, the code should properly sanitize the `mask` input to prevent any malicious code from being injected. This can be achieved by using a library like OWASP ESAPI to encode the input. The corrected code should look like this: `return input.replace("script", mask);` and `mask = ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(mask);` before passing it
