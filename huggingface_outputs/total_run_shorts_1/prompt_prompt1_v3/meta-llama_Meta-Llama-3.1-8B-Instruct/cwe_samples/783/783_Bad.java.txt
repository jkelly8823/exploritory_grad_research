 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a division by zero vulnerability. This is because the initialInvestment variable is being divided by itself, which will result in a division by zero error when the initialInvestment is zero.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the line where the returnROI is calculated. The initialInvestment is being divided by itself, which is mathematically incorrect. This will result in a division by zero error when the initialInvestment is zero. This is a critical vulnerability that needs to be addressed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the line where the returnROI is calculated should be changed to returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment; This will correctly calculate the return on investment without the division by zero error. Alternatively, the code could be modified to handle the case where the initialInvestment is zero, such as by returning a specific value or throwing an exception.  ```python
def calculate_return_on_investment(current_value, initial_investment):
    return_value = 0.0

    # calculate return on investment
    return_value = current_value - initial_investment / initial_investment
    return return_value
```
