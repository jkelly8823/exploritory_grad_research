VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an HMAC key roll-over attack. This is because the HMAC key is being updated on every clock cycle when hmac_patch_en is asserted. This allows an attacker to easily predict the HMAC key, leading to a potential security breach.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the HMAC key is being updated on every clock cycle. This is problematic because an attacker can easily predict the HMAC key by simply keeping track of the previous key. This allows them to bypass the HMAC verification, leading to a potential security breach. This is a classic example of a key roll-over attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the HMAC key should be updated only when a valid HMAC patch is received, and not on every clock cycle. This can be achieved by moving the hmac_key_reg <= hmac_key_i; line inside the hmac_patch_valid signal. This ensures that the HMAC key is only updated when a valid HMAC patch is received, preventing the key roll-over attack. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure random number generator to generate the HMAC key, rather than hardcoding it as is currently done.  The updated code should look like
