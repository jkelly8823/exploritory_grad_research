VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a DNS Rebinding attack. The code is checking if the canonical hostname of the IP address is "trustme.com", but this is not a reliable way to verify the domain name of a server. An attacker could use a DNS rebinding attack to make the server believe it is communicating with a server on the "trustme.com" domain, even if it is not.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the InetAddress.getByName() method to get the canonical hostname of the IP address. However, this method can be tricked by an attacker using a DNS rebinding attack. The attacker could create a DNS record that points to the IP address of the server, but with a different canonical hostname. The server would then believe it is communicating with a server on the "trustme.com" domain, even if it is not.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more reliable method to verify the domain name of the server, such as checking the Server header in the HTTP request or using a secure method to verify the domain name. One possible fix is to use the following code: if (request
