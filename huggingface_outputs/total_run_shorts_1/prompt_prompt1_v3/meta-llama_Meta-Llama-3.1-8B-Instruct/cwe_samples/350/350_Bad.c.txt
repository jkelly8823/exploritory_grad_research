VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `gethostbyaddr` function, which can return a hostname that is longer than the buffer allocated for `hp->h_name`. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `gethostbyaddr` function can return a hostname that is longer than the buffer allocated for `hp->h_name`. This is because the `gethostbyaddr` function does not perform any bounds checking on the length of the hostname it returns. If the hostname is longer than the buffer allocated for `hp->h_name`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function such as `gethostbyname` instead of `gethostbyaddr`. Alternatively, the code can use a fixed-size buffer to store the hostname, and perform bounds checking to ensure that the hostname does not exceed the buffer size. Additionally, the code should check the return value of `gethostbyaddr` to ensure that it is not
