VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a vulnerability related to a potential buffer overflow. The use of magic numbers (32'hF00 and 32'h800F00) can lead to issues when the address space is not properly defined or if the address range changes.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is written in a hardware description language (HDL) and appears to be a conditional statement that assigns a value to the variable addr_auth based on the value of the address. However, the use of magic numbers (32'hF00 and 32'h800F00) can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Moreover, if the address space is not properly defined or if the address range changes, this code may lead to a buffer overflow or other issues. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Define the address range using a named constant or a parameter to make the code more readable and maintainable.
2. Use a more robust way to compare the address, such as using a comparison operator or a function that takes the address as an argument.
3. Consider using a hardware description language (HDL) feature that allows you to specify the address range in
