 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a race condition that can occur when multiple processes access the shared resource q. This is because the value of q is not immediately updated when addr_auth and write_auth are true, but instead is updated on the next clock cycle.
EXPLANATION: The always @* block is sensitive to all signals, but the always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n) block is sensitive to the clock and reset signals. This means that the value of q is not immediately updated when addr_auth and write_auth are true, but instead is updated on the next clock cycle. This can lead to a race condition if multiple processes access the shared resource q at the same time.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the always @* block should be modified to use the always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n) sensitivity list. This will ensure that the value of q is updated immediately when addr_auth and write_auth are true. Additionally, the use of non-blocking assignments (<=) should be avoided in favor of blocking assignments (=) to ensure that the value of q is updated immediately. The always @* block should be removed
