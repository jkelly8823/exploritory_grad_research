VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The `for` loop is not atomic and can be interrupted by the `posedge clk_i` event. This can cause the loop to be executed partially or not at all, leading to unpredictable behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `always` block is sensitive to the `posedge clk_i` event, which means it will be executed on every rising edge of the clock. The `for` loop inside the block is not protected by any synchronization mechanism, making it susceptible to being interrupted by the clock event. This can cause the loop to be executed partially or not at all, leading to unpredictable behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `for` loop should be wrapped in a synchronization mechanism, such as a `posedge clk_i` event or a `@(posedge clk_i) begin ... end` block. This will ensure that the loop is executed atomically, preventing race conditions. Alternatively, the loop can be moved outside the `always` block, but this may not be desirable if the loop is intended to be executed on every clock cycle.
