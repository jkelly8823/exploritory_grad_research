VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential timing issue due to a non-deterministic reset sequence.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises because the reset sequence is not deterministic, as it depends on the combination of rst_ni, jtag_unlock, and rst_9. This could potentially lead to a situation where the reset is not properly applied, resulting in an unpredictable system state. Additionally, the use of a non-deterministic reset sequence can make it difficult to debug and test the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a deterministic reset sequence, such as a single reset signal that is asserted when the system is powered on or reset. This will ensure that the reset sequence is always properly applied, and the system state is predictable. It is also recommended to add test cases to ensure that the system behaves correctly under different reset scenarios. 

Note: The code snippet is a Verilog module, and the vulnerability is related to the reset sequence.
