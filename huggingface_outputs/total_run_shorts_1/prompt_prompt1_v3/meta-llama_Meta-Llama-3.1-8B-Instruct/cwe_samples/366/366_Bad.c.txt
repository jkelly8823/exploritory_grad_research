 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a vulnerability due to the use of a static variable in a non-reentrant function. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the function is called concurrently.
EXPLANATION: The function storenum() uses a static variable counter to keep track of the number of times it is called. However, this variable is not thread-safe, and its value can be overwritten when the function is called concurrently. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the static variable counter should be replaced with a thread-safe alternative, such as an atomic integer or a lock. Alternatively, the function storenum() can be made reentrant by removing the static variable and using a different approach to keep track of the number of times it is called. For example, the function can return the current value of foo and increment it in the calling code. This would eliminate the need for a static variable and make the function thread-safe.
