VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a non-cryptographically secure hash function (HMAC) in a way that allows an attacker to manipulate the input data to the hash function to affect the timing of the hash computation.
EXPLANATION: The HMAC function is used with a key and a message, but the key is not properly validated or sanitized. This allows an attacker to manipulate the key to affect the timing of the hash computation, potentially allowing them to deduce information about the message. Additionally, the use of a non-cryptographically secure hash function (HMAC) in a way that allows an attacker to manipulate the input data to the hash function to affect the timing of the hash computation is a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a cryptographically secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, and ensure that the key is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the hash function. Additionally, the code should use a constant-time hash function to prevent timing attacks. This can be achieved by using a library that provides a constant-time hash function, such as OpenSSL
