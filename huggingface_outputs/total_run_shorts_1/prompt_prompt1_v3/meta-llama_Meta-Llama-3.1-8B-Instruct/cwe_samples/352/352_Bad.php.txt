VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct use of user input in database query.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the `SendUpdateToDatabase` function which likely uses the user input from `$_POST['email']` directly in a database query. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The `update_profile` function is defined inside the main code block, which is not a good practice. It should be defined outside the main code block.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Define the `update_profile` function outside the main code block.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Validate and sanitize user input before using it in database queries. 
4. Consider using a more secure way to handle user sessions, such as using a library like PHP-FIG's PSR-7. 
5. Use a more secure way to handle errors, such as using try-catch blocks. 
6. Consider using a framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter to handle database interactions securely. 
7. Use a linter or code analyzer to catch potential security issues. 
8. Regularly update and patch
