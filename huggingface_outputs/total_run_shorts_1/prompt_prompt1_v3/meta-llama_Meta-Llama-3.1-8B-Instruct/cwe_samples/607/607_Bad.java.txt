VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it does not initialize the USER_ROLES array, which could lead to a NullPointerException if it is used before initialization.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet declares a static final array, but it does not initialize it. This could lead to a NullPointerException if the array is used before initialization. However, since the array is declared as final, it cannot be reassigned, so it must be initialized at the time of declaration.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Initialize the USER_ROLES array at the time of declaration, like this: public static final String[] USER_ROLES = {"role1", "role2"}; or use a static initializer block to initialize the array.  Alternatively, consider using a non-final array and initializing it in a static initializer block.  However, this would require careful consideration of thread safety.  It is also worth noting that using a static final array may not be the best design choice, as it makes it difficult to change the array later.  A more flexible design might use a non-static array or a configuration file to store the roles.  However, this would
