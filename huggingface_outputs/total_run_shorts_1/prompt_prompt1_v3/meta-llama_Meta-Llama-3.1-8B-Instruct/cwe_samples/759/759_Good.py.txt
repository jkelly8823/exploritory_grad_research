VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a fixed salt in the password hashing process. This allows an attacker to measure the time it takes to hash a password, potentially revealing information about the password.
EXPLANATION: The use of a fixed salt in the password hashing process is a significant security risk. A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing, which helps to prevent attackers from using precomputed tables of hashes (rainbow tables) to crack the password. However, in this code, the salt is hardcoded as 'SaltGoesHere', which means that the same salt is used for all users. This allows an attacker to measure the time it takes to hash a password, potentially revealing information about the password. A timing attack can be used to determine the length of the password, and even the specific characters used in the password.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, a random salt should be generated for each user. This can be done using the os.urandom function to generate a random byte string. The salt should then be stored along with the hashed password in the database. When verifying a password, the
