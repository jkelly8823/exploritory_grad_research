VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded database credentials are present in the code.
EXPLANATION: Hardcoded database credentials are a significant security risk as they can be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database and potentially allow attackers to manipulate or steal sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Store database credentials in a secure environment variable or a secrets management system.
2. Use a configuration file to store database credentials, and load them into the application at runtime.
3. Avoid hardcoding database credentials directly in the code. Instead, use placeholders or environment variables to store the credentials. This will make it easier to rotate or update the credentials without modifying the code. 4. Consider using a library or framework that provides a secure way to handle database credentials. 5. Regularly review and update database credentials to ensure they are secure and up-to-date. 6. Consider implementing a secrets manager to securely store and manage database credentials. 7. Use a secure protocol to connect to the database, such as SSL/TLS. 8. Limit database access to only the necessary privileges. 9. Monitor database activity for suspicious behavior. 10.
