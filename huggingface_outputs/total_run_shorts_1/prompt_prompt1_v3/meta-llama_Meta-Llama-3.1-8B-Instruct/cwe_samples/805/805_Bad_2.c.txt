VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the destination buffer 'dest' due to the use of'sizeof(source)-1' as the number of characters to copy.
EXPLANATION: The'strncpy' function does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the number of characters to copy is equal to or greater than the size of the destination buffer. In this case, the size of the destination buffer 'dest' is 12, but the number of characters to copy is 20 (sizeof(source)-1). This can lead to a buffer overflow, where the destination buffer is filled beyond its capacity, potentially causing undefined behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use'strncpy' with the correct number of characters to copy, which is the size of the destination buffer minus one. Alternatively, use a safer function like'snprintf' or'strcpy_s' to avoid buffer overflows. For example: strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest)-1); or snprintf(dest, sizeof(dest), "%s", source);. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the null-termination of the source string, but it is not relevant to the vulnerability in question.
