VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of realloc() without checking the return value and the subsequent use of the potentially oversized buffer in scrub_memory().
EXPLANATION: The realloc() function can return NULL if the reallocation fails, but the code does not check for this. Additionally, the scrub_memory() function is called with the potentially oversized buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Check the return value of realloc() to ensure it is not NULL before using the buffer.
2. Use a safer function to allocate memory, such as malloc() or a memory pool.
3. Use a function that can handle the buffer size, such as a buffer that can grow dynamically. 
4. Use a secure function to scrub the memory, such as a function that uses a secure memory scrubbing algorithm. 
5. Consider using a secure coding library or framework that can help prevent buffer overflows. 6. Consider using a secure coding library or framework that can help prevent buffer overflows. 7. Consider using a secure coding
