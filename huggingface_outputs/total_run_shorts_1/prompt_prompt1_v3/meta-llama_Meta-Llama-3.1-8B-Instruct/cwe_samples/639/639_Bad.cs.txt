VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The `invoiceID.Text` is directly used in the SQL query without any validation or encoding, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even deletion.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or stored procedures to separate the SQL code from the user input. In this case, the `id` parameter should be passed as a parameter to the SQL query instead of being directly inserted into the query string. This can be achieved by using the `SqlCommand` object's `Parameters` collection to add the parameter, as shown in the corrected code below:

```csharp
SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);
```

Alternatively, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Entity Framework to abstract away the underlying database operations and reduce the risk of SQL injection. 

```csharp
