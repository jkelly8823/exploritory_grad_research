VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack due to the direct use of user input in the authentication function without proper sanitization or parameterization.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the $_POST superglobal to directly inject user input into the authentication function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering. The use of user input in this manner is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the user input from the SQL code. This can be achieved by using a library like PDO or MySQLi, which provides a safe and efficient way to execute SQL queries with user input. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize the user input to prevent any malicious characters from being injected. For example, the code could use a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters or use a library like PHP's filter_var function to validate the input. ```php
function authenticate($username, $password) {
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND
