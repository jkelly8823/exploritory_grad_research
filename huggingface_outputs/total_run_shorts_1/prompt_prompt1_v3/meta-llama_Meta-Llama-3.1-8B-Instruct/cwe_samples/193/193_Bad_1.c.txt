VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the fullname variable.
EXPLANATION: The strncat function is used to concatenate strings, but the buffer size of fullname is 40. However, the strncat function is called twice with a buffer size of 20, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the total length of the strings to be concatenated exceeds 40.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer string concatenation function like snprintf or use a dynamically allocated buffer to prevent buffer overflows. For example, you can use the following code: char fullname[40]; snprintf(fullname, sizeof(fullname), "%s %s", firstname, lastname);. This will ensure that the fullname buffer is not overflowed. Alternatively, you can use a dynamically allocated buffer like this: char* fullname = malloc(40); snprintf(fullname, 40, "%s %s", firstname, lastname);. This will prevent buffer overflows and ensure that the fullname buffer is large enough to hold the concatenated string.  ```c
