VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the `malloc` function without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The `malloc` function returns a null pointer if it fails to allocate memory. However, in this code snippet, the return value of `malloc` is not checked. If `malloc` fails to allocate memory, the `WidgetList` pointer will be null, and attempting to access `WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;` will result in a segmentation fault. Additionally, the code does not check if the allocation was successful before using the `WidgetList` pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the return value of `malloc` should be checked to ensure that it is not null before using the `WidgetList` pointer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the allocation was successful. For example: `WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *)); if (WidgetList == NULL) { ExitError("Memory allocation failed!"); }`. This will prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability and ensure that the program does not crash due to a segmentation fault.
