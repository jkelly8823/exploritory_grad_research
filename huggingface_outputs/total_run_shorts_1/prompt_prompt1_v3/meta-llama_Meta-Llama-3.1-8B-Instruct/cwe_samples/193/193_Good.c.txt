VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the fullname variable.
EXPLANATION: The strncat function is used to concatenate strings, but the calculation of the destination buffer size is incorrect. The sizeof(fullname) returns the total size of the buffer, but the strlen(fullname) returns the current length of the string. The correct calculation should be sizeof(fullname) - strlen(fullname) - 1 to leave space for the null terminator. However, the code uses sizeof(fullname)-strlen(fullname)-1 which is incorrect and can lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the correct calculation for the destination buffer size, which is sizeof(fullname) - strlen(fullname) - 1. Also, consider using safer string functions like strlcat or snprintf to avoid buffer overflows.
