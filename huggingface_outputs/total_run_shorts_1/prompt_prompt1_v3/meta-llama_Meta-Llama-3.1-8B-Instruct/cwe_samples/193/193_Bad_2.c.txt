VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to writing beyond the bounds of the filename array.
EXPLANATION: The loop iterates from 0 to PATH_SIZE (inclusive), which means it will attempt to write to filename[PATH_SIZE]. However, arrays in C are 0-indexed, meaning the last valid index is PATH_SIZE - 1. This will cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to undefined behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Change the loop condition to i < PATH_SIZE to prevent writing beyond the bounds of the array. Additionally, consider using a safer function like fgets() to read the filename, which will automatically null-terminate the string and prevent buffer overflows. 

Note: The getc() function is assumed to be reading from a file or other input source, and 'EOF' is assumed to be a valid return value indicating the end of the file. In a real-world scenario, you would want to handle the 'EOF' case more robustly.  The getc() function is also assumed to return the next character from the input source, not the character that was just read.  The getc() function is
