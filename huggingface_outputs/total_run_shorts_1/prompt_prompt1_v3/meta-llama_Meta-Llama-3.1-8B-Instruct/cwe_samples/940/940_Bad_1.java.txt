VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a URL scheme hijacking attack. An attacker could potentially inject malicious data into the UserData variable by manipulating the URL.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the URL starts with "examplescheme:", and if it does, it checks if the next part of the URL is "getUserInfo". If it is, it calls the writeDataToView function with the UserData variable. However, if the URL does not match this pattern, it simply returns true, allowing the URL to be loaded in the WebView. This is a problem because an attacker could craft a URL that starts with "examplescheme:", but does not contain "getUserInfo", and still have the UserData variable populated with malicious data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate the URL before calling the writeDataToView function. This could be done by using a more robust URL parsing library, or by implementing a custom URL validation function. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the URL does not match the expected pattern, rather than simply returning true. This could be done by throwing an exception or returning
