 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The BookStore class has a potential vulnerability due to its tight coupling with the BookStoreInventory and SalesDBManager classes. This tight coupling can make it difficult to change or replace these classes without affecting the BookStore class.
EXPLANATION: The BookStore class has a direct reference to the BookStoreInventory and SalesDBManager classes, which can make it difficult to change or replace these classes without affecting the BookStore class. This is an example of tight coupling, which can lead to a rigid and inflexible design. If the BookStoreInventory or SalesDBManager classes need to be changed or replaced, the BookStore class will also need to be modified, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To address this vulnerability, consider using dependency injection to decouple the BookStore class from the BookStoreInventory and SalesDBManager classes. This can be achieved by injecting instances of these classes into the BookStore class through its constructor or setter methods. This will make it easier to change or replace these classes without affecting the BookStore class. Additionally, consider using interfaces or abstract classes to define the contracts for these classes, which will make it
