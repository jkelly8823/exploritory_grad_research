 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the use of a raw type (complexType) and a non-type-safe reference to an external class (otherClass externalClass).
EXPLANATION: The use of a raw type (complexType) can lead to ClassCastException at runtime, as the compiler does not check the type of the object being assigned to the variable. Additionally, the non-type-safe reference to the external class (otherClass externalClass) can lead to a NullPointerException if the external class is not properly initialized or if it does not have the required methods.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the raw type (complexType) with a parameterized type (e.g., List<String>) and use a type-safe reference to the external class (e.g., otherClass externalClass = new otherClass()). Also, ensure that the external class is properly initialized and has the required methods before using it.
