VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to deserialize an object from a file using ObjectInputStream. However, the file is not validated or sanitized, making it vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker could manipulate the file to inject malicious objects, potentially leading to RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safe deserialization mechanism, such as using a whitelist of allowed classes or using a library like Apache Commons Collections. Validate and sanitize the input file before deserialization. Consider using a secure deserialization framework like Java Deserialization Filter. Additionally, ensure that the file is properly closed after use to prevent resource leaks.  Consider using try-with-resources statement to automatically close the FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream.  Consider using a secure way to read the object from the file, such as using a secure deserialization library.
