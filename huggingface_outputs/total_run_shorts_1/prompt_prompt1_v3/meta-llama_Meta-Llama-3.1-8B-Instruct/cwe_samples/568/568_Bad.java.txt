VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of the finalize method. The finalize method is deprecated in Java since version 9 and is not recommended for use. It can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
EXPLANATION: The finalize method is called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed. However, the finalize method is not guaranteed to be called, and its execution can be delayed or even skipped. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. In this code snippet, the finalize method is used to call the discardNative method, which may lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using the try-with-resources statement or the close method to ensure that resources are properly released. Alternatively, consider using a more modern approach, such as using a try-with-resources statement or a lambda expression to handle resource cleanup. For example: try (NativeResource resource = new NativeResource()) { // use the resource } or resource.close();. This will ensure that resources are properly released and prevent potential security issues.  Additionally, consider removing the finalize method altogether and instead use a
