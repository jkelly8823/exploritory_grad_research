VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an IAM policy bypass due to the use of gsutil iam get command with a hardcoded bucket name. This allows an attacker to access the IAM policy of the bucket without proper authentication.
EXPLANATION: The gsutil iam get command is used to retrieve the IAM policy of a bucket. However, in this code snippet, the bucket name is hardcoded as 'gs://BUCKET_NAME'. This means that anyone with access to this code can access the IAM policy of the bucket without needing to authenticate. This is a security risk as it allows an attacker to access sensitive information about the bucket's IAM policy.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the bucket name should be replaced with a variable that is securely stored and retrieved, such as an environment variable or a secret stored in a secure location. Additionally, the IAM policy of the bucket should be reviewed and updated to ensure that it is secure and does not grant unnecessary access to the bucket. The gsutil iam get command should also be used with caution and only when necessary, as it can potentially reveal sensitive information about the bucket's IAM policy.  The code should be reviewed and updated
