VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities. However, it does contain a potential security risk. The `--allow-blob-public-access` flag is being set to `true`, which allows public access to blobs in the storage account. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet is using the Azure CLI to update a storage account. The `--allow-blob-public-access` flag is being set to `true`, which allows public access to blobs in the storage account. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. However, this is not a traditional vulnerability in the sense that it is not a code-level issue, but rather a configuration-level issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To mitigate this risk, consider setting the `--allow-blob-public-access` flag to `false` by default, and only setting it to `true` when necessary. Additionally, ensure that the storage account is properly secured with access controls and authentication mechanisms. Consider using Azure Storage's built-in features, such as Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, to secure access to the storage account.  Consider using Azure Policy to
