 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the use of the 'allUsers' role, which grants access to the bucket to anyone. This can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
EXPLANATION: The 'allUsers' role is a predefined IAM role that grants access to the bucket to anyone, regardless of their identity or permissions. This can be a significant security risk if not properly managed. In this code snippet, the 'allUsers' role is used in conjunction with the 'roles/storage.legacyBucketReader' role, which grants read-only access to the bucket. This means that anyone can read the contents of the bucket, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this risk, consider replacing the 'allUsers' role with a more restrictive role, such as a custom role that grants access to specific users or groups. Additionally, ensure that the 'roles/storage.legacyBucketReader' role is only granted to users or groups that require read-only access to the bucket. It is also recommended to regularly review and update the IAM roles and permissions to ensure they align with the organization's security policies and
