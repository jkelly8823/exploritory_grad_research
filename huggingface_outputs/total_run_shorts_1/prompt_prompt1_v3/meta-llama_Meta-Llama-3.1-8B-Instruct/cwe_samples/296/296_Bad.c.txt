 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns a pointer to an X509 structure, but it does not check if this pointer is null before dereferencing it. If the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns null, the code will attempt to access memory at address 0, leading to a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using the OpenSSL library to verify the certificate of a peer. The SSL_get_peer_certificate function is used to retrieve the peer's certificate, and the SSL_get_verify_result function is used to verify the certificate. However, the code does not check if the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns null before dereferencing the pointer. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a segmentation fault.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns null before dereferencing the pointer. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the if statement. For example: if (cert!= NULL && (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host) foo = SSL
