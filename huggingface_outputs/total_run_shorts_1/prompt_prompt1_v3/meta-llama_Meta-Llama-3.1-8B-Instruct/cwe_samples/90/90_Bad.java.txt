VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A SQL injection vulnerability is present due to the direct concatenation of user input into a search filter.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses string concatenation to build a search filter, which can lead to a SQL injection vulnerability. This is because the `address` variable is directly concatenated into the search filter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement or parameterized query to separate the user input from the SQL code. This can be achieved by using a library like Apache Commons Lang or a database-specific API. For example, you can use the `String.format()` method to insert the `address` variable into the search filter in a safe manner. Alternatively, you can use a database-specific API to create a parameterized query. For example, in Java, you can use the `PreparedStatement` class to create a parameterized query. ```java
String searchFilter = String.format("StreetAddress=%s", address);
``` or ```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE StreetAddress =?");
pstmt.setString
