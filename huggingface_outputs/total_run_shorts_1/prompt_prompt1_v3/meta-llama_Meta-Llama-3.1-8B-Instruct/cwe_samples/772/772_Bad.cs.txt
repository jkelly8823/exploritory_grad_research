VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input (queryString) into the SQL command without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries by replacing queryString with a parameter and passing the actual query string as a parameter value. For example: cmd.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = @param"; cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@param", queryString); Additionally, consider using a more secure connection string and ensuring that the connection is properly closed and disposed of after use.
