VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input (some_connection_string) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement with parameterized queries. For example, you can use a PreparedStatement with a parameterized query like "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column =?" and then set the parameter value using the setString method. This will prevent the attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, consider using a connection pool and a robust logging mechanism to handle exceptions and errors.
