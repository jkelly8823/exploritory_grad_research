VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Resource Leak. The BufferReader object is not properly closed in case of an exception being thrown.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a try-catch block to handle exceptions, but it does not properly close the BufferReader object in case of an exception. This can lead to a resource leak, where the file is not properly closed and the system runs out of resources. This is a common issue in Java, where the garbage collector does not immediately free up resources when an exception is thrown.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a try-with-resources statement, which automatically closes the BufferReader object even if an exception is thrown. Alternatively, the code can be modified to manually close the BufferReader object in a finally block. Here is an example of how the code can be modified: 
```java
private void processFile(string fName){
    try (BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = fil.ReadLine())!= null) {
            processLine(line);
        }
    } catch (
