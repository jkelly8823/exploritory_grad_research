VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks. The code relies on the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header to determine the client's IP address, which can be easily spoofed by an attacker. Additionally, the code does not properly validate the IP address, allowing an attacker to bypass the IP allowlist.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it trusts the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header, which can be set by an attacker to any value. This allows an attacker to bypass the IP allowlist and access the page. The code also does not validate the IP address, which means that an attacker can enter any IP address and be granted access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more reliable method to determine the client's IP address, such as the REMOTE_ADDR variable. The code should also validate the IP address to ensure it is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. Additionally, the code should use a more secure method to store and compare the IP allowlist, such as using a database or a
