 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The regular expression pattern used in the code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. This is because the pattern contains a quantifier (*) that can cause the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop when processing certain inputs.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression pattern /^(\w+\s?)*$/i is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. This is because the quantifier (*) after the group (\w+\s?) can cause the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop when processing certain inputs. The pattern is designed to match one or more word characters (\w+) followed by an optional whitespace character (\s?). However, when the input string contains a large number of characters that match the pattern, the regular expression engine can enter an infinite loop, causing the program to consume excessive resources and potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression pattern should be modified to prevent the ReDoS attack. One way to do this is to use a possessive quantifier (++) instead of the non-possessive quantifier (*). This will prevent the regular expression engine
