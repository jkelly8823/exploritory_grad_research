VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential path traversal attack. This occurs because the `DEFAULT_FILE_PATH` is hardcoded and allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `DEFAULT_FILE_PATH` is hardcoded to a specific directory on the system. This allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the `inputFilePath` variable. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack. The `setInputFile` method does not validate the input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious input and potentially read sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `DEFAULT_FILE_PATH` should be removed and the `inputFilePath` variable should be validated to ensure it only points to a specific directory. Additionally, the `setInputFile` method should be updated to validate the input and prevent path traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a library such as Apache Commons IO to validate the file path. The `readInputFile` method should also be updated to handle the `FileNotFoundException` exception properly. The `System.err.println` statements should be replaced with a more robust error handling mechanism.  The `
