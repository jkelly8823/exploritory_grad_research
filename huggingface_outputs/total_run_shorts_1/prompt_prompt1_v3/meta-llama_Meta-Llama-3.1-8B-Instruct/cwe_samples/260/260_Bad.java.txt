VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded credentials are present in the code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded credentials (username and password) which are directly assigned to variables. This is a security risk as these credentials can be easily accessed by unauthorized parties.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive information like credentials.
2. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the code.
3. Consider using a library or framework that supports secure credential management.  ```python
import os

# Use environment variables to store credentials
username = os.environ.get('LDAP_USERNAME')
password = os.environ.get('LDAP_PASSWORD')

# If environment variables are not set, use a secure secrets management system
if not username or not password:
    # Load credentials from a secure secrets management system
    # For example, using a library like python-dotenv
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    username = os.environ.get('LDAP_USERNAME')
    password = os.environ.get('LDAP_PASSWORD')
```  ```python
import os

# Use environment variables to store credentials
username = os.environ.get('LDAP
