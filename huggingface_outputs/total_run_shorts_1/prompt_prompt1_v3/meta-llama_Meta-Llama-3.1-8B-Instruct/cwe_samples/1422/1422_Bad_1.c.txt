VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present. The value of idx_array[idx] is multiplied by idx, which can result in a large value. This large value is then used as an array index, which can lead to a buffer overflow if idx_array[idx] is greater than or equal to the size of the array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the line where v is assigned. The variable idx_array[idx] is multiplied by idx, which can result in a large value. This large value is then used as an array index, which can lead to a buffer overflow if idx_array[idx] is greater than or equal to the size of the array. This can cause the program to crash or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a bounds check to ensure that idx_array[idx] is within the valid range of the array before using it as an index. You can do this by checking if idx_array[idx] is less than the size of the array. If it is not, you should return an error or handle the situation accordingly. Additionally, you should consider using
