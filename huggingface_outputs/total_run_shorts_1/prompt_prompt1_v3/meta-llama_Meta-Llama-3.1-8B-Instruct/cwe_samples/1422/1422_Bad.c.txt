VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this code due to the use of an untrusted argument in a pointer arithmetic operation.
EXPLANATION: The variable 'arg_copy' is assigned an untrusted value from 'untrusted_arg'. Then, an array is accessed using a pointer that is multiplied by 4096. This can cause the program to access memory locations outside the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer overflow. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the value of 'arg_copy' is validated and sanitized before being used in pointer arithmetic operations. Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to pointer arithmetic, such as using a bounds-checked array access. The code should be reviewed to ensure that all untrusted input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  It is also recommended to use a memory-safe language or compiler that can detect and prevent buffer overflows.  It is also recommended to use a secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflows.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that all untrusted input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent similar vulnerabilities.  It is
