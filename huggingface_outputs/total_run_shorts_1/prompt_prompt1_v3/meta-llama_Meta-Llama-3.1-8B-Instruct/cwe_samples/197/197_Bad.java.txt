VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct user input being used in a database query without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The `updateSalesForProduct` method directly uses the `productID` parameter in a database query without any sanitization or validation. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `productID` parameter, allowing them to access or modify sensitive data in the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `productID` parameter should be properly sanitized and validated before being used in the database query. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries, which separate the SQL code from the user input. For example, the `updateSalesCount` method could be modified to use a prepared statement with a parameter for the `productID` value. Additionally, input validation should be performed to ensure that the `productID` parameter conforms to the expected format and length.
