VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to integer overflow. The expression `1 << (sizeof(int)*8-1)` is attempting to create a value that is one bit larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`. However, this value is then used in a bitwise XOR operation with the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`, which is `~((int)0)`. This can cause an integer overflow, resulting in an incorrect value being assigned to `intPrimitive`.
