VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The `address` variable is directly inserted into the SQL query, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even deletion.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a parameterized query or prepared statement with a whitelist of allowed characters. In this case, the `address` variable should be sanitized before being inserted into the SQL query. This can be achieved by using a library like OWASP ESAPI or by manually sanitizing the input using a whitelist of allowed characters. Additionally, consider using a ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract away the SQL queries and reduce the risk of SQL injection.
