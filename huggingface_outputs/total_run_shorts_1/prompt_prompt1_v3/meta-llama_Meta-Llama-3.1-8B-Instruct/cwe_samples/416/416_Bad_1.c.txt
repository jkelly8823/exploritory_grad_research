VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present. The pointer `ptr` is freed when an error occurs, but it is still used later in the code.
EXPLANATION: The `free(ptr)` call is executed when an error occurs, which frees the memory pointed to by `ptr`. However, the code then attempts to use `ptr` again in the `logError` function, which is undefined behavior because the memory has already been freed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should not use `ptr` after it has been freed. Instead, it should store the contents of `ptr` in a local variable before freeing it, and then use the local variable in the `logError` function. For example: `char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);if (err) {abrt = 1;char* ptr_copy = ptr;free(ptr);}...if (abrt) {logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr_copy);}`. This ensures that the memory is not accessed after it has been freed.
