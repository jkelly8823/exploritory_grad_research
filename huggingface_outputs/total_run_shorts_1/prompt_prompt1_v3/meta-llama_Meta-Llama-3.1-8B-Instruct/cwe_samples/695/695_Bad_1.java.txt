VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a remote code execution attack due to the creation of a socket to a remote server. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code or data into the server.
EXPLANATION: The creation of a socket to a remote server can be used to inject malicious code or data into the server. This is a classic example of a remote code execution attack. The attacker can potentially send malicious data to the server, which can then be executed by the server, leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to only connect to trusted servers and to validate any incoming data from the remote server. Additionally, the use of a socket should be avoided in favor of a more secure communication mechanism, such as HTTPS. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that any sensitive data is properly sanitized and validated before being used.  The use of a try-catch block is good practice, but it should be used to handle specific exceptions that may occur, rather than a general Exception.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is following the principle of least privilege, and that it
