VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a native code injection attack. This is because the System.loadLibrary() method is used to load a native library from a user-controlled location, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The System.loadLibrary() method is used to load a native library from a file specified by the user. In this case, the library is loaded from a file named "echo". However, if an attacker can manipulate the file system to replace the "echo" library with a malicious library, they can execute arbitrary code on the system. This is a classic example of a native code injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to load the native library, such as using a whitelist of allowed libraries or using a secure library loading mechanism. One possible solution is to use the System.load() method with a path to a trusted library, or to use a library loading mechanism that is designed to prevent native code injection attacks. For example, the code could use the following line to load the library: System.load("/path/to/trusted/library");. Alternatively, the code could use a library loading
