VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to an infinite loop. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack due to the use of a hardcoded secret key and the lack of encryption for the communication between the client and server.
EXPLANATION: The while loop will continue indefinitely, allowing an attacker to send an arbitrary number of packets to the server, potentially causing it to run out of resources. Furthermore, the secret key is hardcoded and not encrypted, making it easily accessible to an attacker who can intercept the communication between the client and server. This allows an attacker to impersonate the client and send arbitrary data to the server, potentially causing it to perform unauthorized actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the while loop should be modified to have a finite condition, such as a timeout or a maximum number of iterations. Additionally, the secret key should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure key store, and the communication between the client and server should be encrypted using a secure protocol such as TLS. The code should also be modified to validate the
