VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the creation of a new thread without properly handling its lifecycle. This can lead to memory leaks and other issues if not managed correctly.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet creates a new thread to handle background processing, but it does not properly handle the thread's lifecycle. The thread is started, but it is not guaranteed to be properly shut down or cleaned up when it is no longer needed. This can lead to resource leaks and other issues if the thread is not properly managed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly handle the thread's lifecycle by using a try-finally block to ensure that the thread is properly shut down when it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by using a ThreadFactory or a ExecutorService to manage the thread's lifecycle. Additionally, the code should consider using a thread pool to manage a pool of threads that can be reused, rather than creating a new thread for each request. This can help to reduce the overhead of thread creation and management. 

Note: The actual code snippet is a bit longer, but the relevant part is the creation of
