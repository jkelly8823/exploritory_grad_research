VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct concatenation of user input (in this case, the database connection string) into a SQL query.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly uses a hardcoded database connection string. An attacker could potentially manipulate this string to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access or modification. This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the database connection string should be parameterized or sanitized to prevent any malicious input from being injected into the SQL query. This can be achieved by using a prepared statement or a parameterized query. For example, the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method can be replaced with a prepared statement that uses a parameterized query. Additionally, it's recommended to use a secure way to store sensitive data like database connection strings, such as environment variables or a secrets manager.
