VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when allocating memory for the board. This is because the size of the allocation is calculated by multiplying the board height and width, but the maximum allowed values for these dimensions are not taken into account. An attacker could potentially pass a value for m or n that exceeds MAX_DIM, causing the allocation to be larger than expected, and leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array representing a board. However, the size of the allocation is calculated by multiplying the board height (m) and width (n), without considering the maximum allowed values for these dimensions. This can lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker passes a value for m or n that exceeds MAX_DIM, causing the allocation to be larger than expected. The die function is called when the value passed is too large, but this does not prevent the buffer overflow from occurring.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of the allocation should be calculated using the minimum of m and MAX_DIM, and the minimum of n and MAX_DIM, to ensure that the allocation is not larger than expected. This
