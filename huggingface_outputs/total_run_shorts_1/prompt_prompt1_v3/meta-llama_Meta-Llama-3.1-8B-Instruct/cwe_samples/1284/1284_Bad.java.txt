VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to an arithmetic overflow error. This occurs when the product of two large numbers is calculated and exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a double.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet calculates the total cost by multiplying the price and quantity. If the quantity is large enough, the result of this multiplication can exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a double, resulting in an arithmetic overflow error. This can cause the total cost to be incorrectly calculated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To prevent this vulnerability, the code can use a library that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as Java's BigInteger class. Alternatively, the code can check if the result of the multiplication is within the range of a double before assigning it to the total variable. This can be done by checking if the result is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a double. If it is, the code can throw an exception or handle it in a way that makes sense for the application.
