VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a hardcoded password vulnerability. The password is hardcoded in the code, which is a security risk as it can be easily accessed by an attacker.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the strcmp function to compare the input password with a hardcoded password. This is a security risk because the password is stored in plain text in the code, which can be easily accessed by an attacker. Hardcoded passwords should be avoided and instead, passwords should be stored securely, such as in a database or using a secure password storage mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded password should be removed and replaced with a secure password storage mechanism, such as a database or a secure password storage library. The password should be stored securely and compared with the input password using a secure comparison mechanism. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that there are no other hardcoded passwords or sensitive information stored in plain text.  The password should be hashed and stored securely, and the input password should be hashed and compared with the stored hash. This will prevent an attacker from accessing the password even if they gain access to the code.  The code should also be
