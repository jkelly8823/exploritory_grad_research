VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to an infinite loop. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack due to the use of a hardcoded secret key and the lack of encryption for the communication between the client and server.
EXPLANATION: The while loop in the code snippet runs indefinitely, allowing an attacker to continuously send packets to the server, causing a denial-of-service. Furthermore, the secret key is hardcoded, which means that an attacker who gains access to the server can easily obtain the key and intercept the communication between the client and server. The lack of encryption for the communication between the client and server also makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the while loop should be modified to have a finite condition, such as a timeout or a specific number of iterations. Additionally, the secret key should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure key store. The communication between the client and server should be encrypted using a secure protocol such as TLS. The code should also be reviewed to ensure
