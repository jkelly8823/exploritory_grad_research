VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The code uses the Dns.GetHostByAddress method to resolve the hostname of the remote IP address. However, an attacker can manipulate the DNS response to point to a different IP address, potentially allowing them to access internal resources.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it uses the Dns.GetHostByAddress method to resolve the hostname of the remote IP address. This method can be manipulated by an attacker to point to a different IP address, potentially allowing them to access internal resources. The code then uses the resolved hostname to determine whether the remote IP address is trusted. However, if the attacker can manipulate the DNS response, they can make the remote IP address appear to be trusted, even if it is not.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to determine whether the remote IP address is trusted, such as checking the IP address against a list of known trusted IP addresses or using a secure protocol such as HTTPS to verify the identity of the remote host. Additionally, the code should validate the DNS response to ensure that it is not being manipulated by an
