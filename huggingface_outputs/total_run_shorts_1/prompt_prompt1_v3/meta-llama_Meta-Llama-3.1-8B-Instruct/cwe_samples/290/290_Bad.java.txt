VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks. An attacker can easily spoof the IP address of the client by sending a fake IP address in the request headers. This can be done by modifying the request headers before sending the request to the server.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `getRemoteAddr()` method to get the IP address of the client. However, this method can be easily spoofed by an attacker. The `equals()` method is also used to compare the IP address with the approved IP address. However, the `equals()` method is not suitable for comparing IP addresses as it compares the strings character by character. This can lead to false positives or false negatives. A better approach would be to use the `ipAddress.equals()` method which compares the IP addresses in a more robust way.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `ipAddress.equals()` method to compare the IP addresses. You can also use a library like Apache Commons Net to validate the IP address. Additionally, you can use a more robust method to get the IP address of the client, such as using the `X-Forwarded-
