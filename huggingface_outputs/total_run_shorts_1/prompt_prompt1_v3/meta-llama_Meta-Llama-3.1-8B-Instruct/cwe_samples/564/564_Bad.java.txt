VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input to the `getStreetFromUser()` method. The use of string concatenation to build the SQL query makes it susceptible to injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can be achieved by using the `setParameter()` method to bind the user input to a parameter in the query. For example: `query = session.createQuery("from Address a where a.street = :street"); query.setParameter("street", street);` This approach prevents an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code by ensuring that the user input is treated as a parameter rather than part of the SQL code. Additionally, consider using a library like Hibernate to help prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Also, validate user input to prevent unexpected input.  Consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input.  This will help prevent unexpected input from causing issues.  Also, consider using a library like OW
