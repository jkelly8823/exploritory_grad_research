VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a class loader leak. The URLClassLoader is not properly closed, which can lead to resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The URLClassLoader is not properly closed, which can lead to resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities. This is because the ClassLoader is not being closed after it is used to load the class. This can lead to a class loader leak, where the class loader is not properly garbage collected, and can lead to resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the URLClassLoader should be closed after it is used to load the class. This can be done by calling the close() method on the ClassLoader. For example: loader.close(); after the Class.forName() call. This will ensure that the class loader is properly closed and garbage collected, preventing resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities.
