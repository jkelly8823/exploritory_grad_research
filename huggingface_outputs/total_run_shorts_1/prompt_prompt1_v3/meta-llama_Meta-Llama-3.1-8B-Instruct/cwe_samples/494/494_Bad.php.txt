VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification. The use of `mysql_query` and `mysql_numrows` is also deprecated and should be avoided.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Replace `mysql_query` and `mysql_numrows` with `mysqli` or `PDO` functions, which are more secure and support prepared statements. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input and prevent any malicious characters from being injected into the SQL query. For example, you can use `mysqli_real_escape_string` to escape any special characters in the user input. Here is an example of how to use prepared statements with `mysqli`: ```php $stmt = $mysqli->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username =? AND password =?'); $stmt->bind_param('ss', $username, $password); $stmt->execute(); $result = $stmt->get_result(); ``` ```php
