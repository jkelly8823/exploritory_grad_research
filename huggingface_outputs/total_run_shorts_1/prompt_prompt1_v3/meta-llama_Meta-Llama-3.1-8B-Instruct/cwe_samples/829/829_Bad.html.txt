 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of input validation and sanitization on the username and password fields. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields, which would be executed by the browser when the form is submitted.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a form that submits user input to a PHP script (login.php). However, the input is not validated or sanitized before being sent to the server. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the username or password fields, which would be executed by the browser when the form is submitted. This could lead to a range of attacks, including stealing user credentials or taking control of the user's session.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to validate and sanitize user input before submitting it to the server. This can be done using techniques such as HTML escaping or using a library that provides input validation and sanitization. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a secure method of transmitting user credentials, such as HTTPS. The PHP script (login.php) should also be reviewed to ensure that it properly handles user
