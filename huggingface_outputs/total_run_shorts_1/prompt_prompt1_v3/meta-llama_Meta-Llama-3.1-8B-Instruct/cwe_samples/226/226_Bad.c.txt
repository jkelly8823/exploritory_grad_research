VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of realloc() without checking the return value and the subsequent use of the potentially oversized buffer.
EXPLANATION: The realloc() function can return NULL if the reallocation fails. However, in this code snippet, the return value is not checked. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the reallocation fails and the original buffer is not freed. Additionally, the scrub_memory() function is called with the potentially oversized buffer, which can also lead to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Check the return value of realloc() and handle the case where it returns NULL. Free the original buffer if realloc() fails. Also, ensure that the scrub_memory() function is called with the correct buffer size to prevent a buffer overflow. The corrected code should be: ```cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024); if (cleartext_buffer == NULL) {     free(cleartext_buffer);     cleartext_buffer = NULL; }``` and then use the corrected buffer size in the scrub_memory() function call. ```scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer
