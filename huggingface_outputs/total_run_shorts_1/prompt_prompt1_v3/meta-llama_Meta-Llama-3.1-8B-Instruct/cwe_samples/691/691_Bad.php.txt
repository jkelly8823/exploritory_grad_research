VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a file inclusion vulnerability. This is because the file_get_contents function is used to read the file into a string without any validation or sanitization of the filename. An attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to include malicious code or sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The file_get_contents function is used to read the contents of a file into a string. However, this function does not perform any validation or sanitization of the filename. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to include malicious code or sensitive information. For example, if the filename is set to something like '../config.inc.php', the file_get_contents function would read the contents of the config.inc.php file, which could contain sensitive information such as database credentials. This could lead to a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to validate and sanitize the filename before passing it to the file_get_contents function. This could be done by using a whitelist of allowed filenames or by using a function that sanitizes the filename. Additionally, the code should be modified to check the file extension and only allow files with a specific extension. This
