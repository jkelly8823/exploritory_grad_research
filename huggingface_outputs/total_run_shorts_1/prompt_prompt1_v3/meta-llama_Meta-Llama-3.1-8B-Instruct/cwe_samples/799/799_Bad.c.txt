VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `getNextMessage` function is not checked for its return value, and the `AuthenticateUser` function is not checked for its return value. This allows an attacker to potentially overflow the `username` and `password` buffers, leading to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `getNextMessage` function is not checked for its return value, which means that if it returns an error, the `username` and `password` buffers will not be properly null-terminated. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, where an attacker can send a message that is longer than the buffer size, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially leading to undefined behavior. Additionally, the `AuthenticateUser` function is not checked for its return value, which means that if it returns an error, the `isValidUser` variable will not be properly set, potentially leading to incorrect authentication results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `getNextMessage` function should be checked for its return value, and the `AuthenticateUser` function should be checked for its return value. The `username` and `password` buffers should be properly
