VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function does not handle the case where the response body is not closed before the function returns, which can lead to resource leaks.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the response.Body.Close() call is deferred, but it will only be executed if the function does not return early. If the function returns early due to an error, the response body will not be closed, leading to a resource leak. This is a common issue in Go, where the deferred function will not be executed if the function returns early.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, you can use a try/finally block to ensure that the response body is closed regardless of whether the function returns early or not. Alternatively, you can use the http.Client's built-in support for closing the response body by using the client's Do method with the Close method of the response. For example: response, err := client.Do(request); if err!= nil { return nil, err }; defer response.Body.Close(); return response, nil. However, this will not work if the function returns early due to an error. A better approach would be to use a try/finally block. Here
