VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the use of strcpy() function which does not perform bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy() function is used to copy the hostname from the hostent structure to the hostname array. However, the size of the hostname array is fixed at 64 characters, which may not be sufficient to hold the hostname. If the hostname is longer than 64 characters, it will overflow the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use the strncpy() function instead of strcpy() to prevent buffer overflow. The strncpy() function allows for specifying the maximum number of characters to be copied, preventing buffer overflow. For example, use strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, 63) to copy at most 63 characters from hp->h_name to hostname. Also, consider using a more secure function like strlcpy() if available. Additionally, validate the length of the hostname before copying it to the buffer to prevent buffer overflow.  ```c
strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, 63);
hostname[63] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination
```  ```c
