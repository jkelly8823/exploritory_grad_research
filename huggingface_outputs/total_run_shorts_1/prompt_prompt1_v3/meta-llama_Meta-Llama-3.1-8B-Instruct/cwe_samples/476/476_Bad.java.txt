VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANANATION: The code is vulnerable to command injection because it directly uses the "cmd" system property without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate the "cmd" property to inject malicious commands, leading to unintended behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the "cmd" system property before using it. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to only allow specific, safe commands. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to retrieve the command, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable. If the "cmd" system property is not necessary, consider removing it altogether.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not using any other potentially vulnerable system properties.  It is also recommended to use a library that can handle command execution securely, such as ProcessBuilder.
