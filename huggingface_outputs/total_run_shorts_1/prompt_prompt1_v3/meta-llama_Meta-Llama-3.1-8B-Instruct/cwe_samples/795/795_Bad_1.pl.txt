VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the code does not properly sanitize the input provided by the user. The line `my $filename = "/home/user/". $Username;` concatenates the user-provided input with a fixed path, allowing an attacker to potentially traverse the file system by manipulating the input to include directory traversal sequences such as `../`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the user input to prevent directory traversal attacks. This can be achieved by using a library that provides input validation and sanitization, such as `Path::Validate`. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to construct the file path, such as using the `File::Spec` module to join the path components. For example: `use File::Spec; my $filename = File::Spec->catfile('/home/user/', $Username);` This will ensure that the file path is constructed in a secure manner, preventing directory traversal attacks.
