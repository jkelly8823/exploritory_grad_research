VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the user input is not sanitized and is directly used to construct a file path.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `GetUntrustedInput` function to retrieve user input, which is then used to construct a file path. The `s/^\.\.\///` regular expression is an attempt to prevent path traversal attacks, but it is not sufficient. This is because it only removes leading `..` sequences, but does not prevent the user from entering a path that is outside of the intended directory. For example, if the user enters `../../etc/passwd`, the code will still attempt to read the file `/home/user/../etc/passwd`, which is outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a library that properly sanitizes user input, such as `Path::Class` or `File::Spec`. The code should also use a secure method to construct the file path, such as using the `File::Spec->catfile` function. Additionally, the code should validate the user input to ensure that it is
