VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability through the use of an untrusted argument to access an array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. The line "array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];" attempts to access an array with an index calculated by multiplying the value pointed to by "trusted_ptr" by 4096. However, if the value pointed to by "trusted_ptr" is large, it could cause the index to exceed the bounds of the array, resulting in a buffer overflow. Additionally, the use of an untrusted argument "untrusted_arg" to copy into a variable "arg_copy" could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the argument is larger than the variable's size.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Validate the input to "call_victim" function to ensure that "untrusted_arg" is within a valid range.
2. Use bounds checking when accessing the array to prevent buffer overflows.
3. Use a safer method to copy data, such as using a library function that handles buffer overflows, like strncpy. 
4. Ensure that "trusted_ptr" points to a valid and trustworthy location in memory
