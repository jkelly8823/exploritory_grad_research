VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
EXPLANATION: 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  There is no vulnerability in this code snippet. It is a simple conditional assignment of a value to a variable based on a condition. The condition checks if the address is equal to a specific value or a specific value with a different prefix. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the use of magic numbers (e.g., 'hF00, 'h800F00) can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It would be better to define these values as constants or enumerations to improve code readability and maintainability.  The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
