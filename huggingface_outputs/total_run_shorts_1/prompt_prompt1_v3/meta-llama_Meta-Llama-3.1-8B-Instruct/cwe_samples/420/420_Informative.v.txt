 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of non-blocking assignments in the always @* block and the always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n) block. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: The use of non-blocking assignments in the always @* block can cause the acl_oh_allowlist to be updated before the previous value is fully propagated, leading to a race condition. Similarly, in the always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n) block, the non-blocking assignments can cause the q and data_out to be updated before the previous values are fully propagated, leading to a race condition. This can cause the q and data_out to have incorrect values, leading to unpredictable behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be rewritten to use blocking assignments instead of non-blocking assignments. This can be done by replacing the non-blocking assignments with blocking assignments, such as using the <= operator instead of the <= operator. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that there are no other potential race conditions.
