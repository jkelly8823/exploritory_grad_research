VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a hardcoded password in the SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb function. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to obtain the password if they gain access to the code.
EXPLANATION: The SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb function is used to set the default password callback for the SSL context. However, in this code, a hardcoded password is used instead of a callback function. This means that the password is stored in plain text in the code, which is a security risk. An attacker who gains access to the code can obtain the password and use it to access the SSL context.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded password should be replaced with a callback function that generates a random password. This can be done by defining a function that generates a random password and passing it to the SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb function. For example: `SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb(ctx, my_password_callback);` where `my_password_callback` is a function that generates a random password. Additionally, the password should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure storage mechanism.
