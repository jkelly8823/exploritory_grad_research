VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential serialization vulnerability. The DataGlob class has a public setter for the "globValue" field, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious data into the session.
EXPLANATION: 
The DataGlob class is being serialized and stored in the HttpSession. However, the class has a public setter for the "globValue" field, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious data into the session. This can lead to a potential security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Make the "globValue" field private to prevent external modification.
2. Use a secure serialization mechanism, such as XStream or Jackson, to serialize the DataGlob object.
3. Implement a custom serialization mechanism that only serializes the necessary fields of the DataGlob object. 
4. Use a secure deserialization mechanism to deserialize the DataGlob object. 
5. Consider using a more secure approach, such as using a Map or a custom object that does not contain sensitive data, to store data in the HttpSession. 6. Make sure to properly handle any exceptions that may occur during the serialization and
