VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the user input for username and password are not validated or sanitized. This allows an attacker to input a string longer than MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH and MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH, respectively, potentially causing a buffer overflow. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer alternative to fixed-size character arrays, such as std::string or a custom string class with bounds checking. Additionally, consider using a secure password hashing library to store passwords securely. Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent buffer overflows. Consider using a library like Boost::asio for secure network operations.  Consider using a secure random number generator for password generation. Consider using a secure protocol for password transmission. Consider using a secure hashing algorithm for password storage.  Consider using a secure method for password reset.  Consider using a secure method for account lockout.  Consider using a secure method for password expiration.  Consider using a secure method for password change.  Consider using a secure method for account deletion.  Consider using a secure method for account creation.  Consider using a secure method
