VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the 'Login' command.
EXPLANATION: The 'Login' command directly uses the 'args' variable without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the 'args' variable before using it in the 'Login' command. This can be achieved by using a library like SQLAlchemy or by implementing a custom validation function. Additionally, consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
