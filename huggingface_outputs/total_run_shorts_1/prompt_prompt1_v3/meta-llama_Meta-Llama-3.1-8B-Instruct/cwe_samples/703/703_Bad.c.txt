 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The fgets function reads at most 9 characters from stdin, but the strcpy function copies the entire contents of buf into cp_buf, which has a size of 10. This means that if the user enters a string longer than 9 characters, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a buffer overflow attack.
EXPLANATION: The fgets function reads at most 10-1 = 9 characters from stdin, because it includes the null terminator. However, the strcpy function copies the entire contents of buf into cp_buf, which has a size of 10. This means that if the user enters a string longer than 9 characters, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a buffer overflow attack. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function like strncpy to copy the contents of buf into cp_buf. You should also check the length of the string before copying it to ensure that it does not overflow the buffer. For example: strncpy(cp_buf, buf, 9); cp_buf[9] = '\0';
