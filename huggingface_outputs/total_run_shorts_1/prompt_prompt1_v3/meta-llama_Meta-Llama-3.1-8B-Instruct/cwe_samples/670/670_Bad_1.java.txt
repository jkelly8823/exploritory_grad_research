VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to direct parameterization of user input.
EXPLANATION: The code directly retrieves user input from the request parameter "email_address" and assigns it to the variable "email" without any sanitization or validation. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use a JDBC PreparedStatement to execute the query with the user input as a parameter. Additionally, validate and sanitize the user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 

VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Null Pointer Exception vulnerability due to direct comparison of a string with null.
EXPLANATION: The code checks if the "email" variable is not null using the "assert" statement. However, this is not a reliable way to handle null pointer exceptions, as it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Instead, use the "Objects.isNull()" method or a simple null check to handle null values.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace
