VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a fallthrough vulnerability in the switch statement. This occurs when the switch statement does not properly handle the case where the input value does not match any of the specified cases. In this case, the code will print the message for the last case (December) regardless of the input month.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement in the code is not properly formatted. The fallthrough vulnerability occurs because the break statement is missing after each case. This allows the code to continue executing and print the message for the last case. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a break statement after each case in the switch statement. This will ensure that the code properly handles the case where the input value does not match any of the specified cases. The corrected code should look like this: case 1: print("January"); break; case 2: print("February"); break;.... This will prevent the fallthrough vulnerability and ensure that the code behaves as expected.  Additionally, consider using an enum or a map to handle the month names, as this would make the code more readable
