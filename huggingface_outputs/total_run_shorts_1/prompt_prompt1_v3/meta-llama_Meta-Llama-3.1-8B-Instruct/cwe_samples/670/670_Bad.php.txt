VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities due to the use of user-supplied input in the $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable without proper sanitization and the use of the http_redirect function which can be used to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection and remote code execution attacks. The $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable is used to store the IP address of the requesting client, but it is not sanitized or validated. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input, potentially leading to SQL injection or remote code execution. Additionally, the http_redirect function is used to redirect the user to an error page, but it can also be used to execute arbitrary code, making it a potential vector for remote code execution attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to sanitize and validate the $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable using a whitelist approach. The http_redirect function should be replaced with a more secure redirect method, such as header('Location:...'). The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all user-supplied input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection and remote code
