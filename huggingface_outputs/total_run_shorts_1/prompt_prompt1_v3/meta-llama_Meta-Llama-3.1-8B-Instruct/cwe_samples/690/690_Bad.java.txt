VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack because it directly compares user input to a hardcoded value (ADMIN_USER) without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The getUserName() method is likely retrieving user input from an external source, such as a database or user input field. If an attacker can manipulate this input, they can potentially inject malicious SQL code by crafting a username that matches the ADMIN_USER value. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system functionality.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a secure method to validate and sanitize user input, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters or a regular expression to match the expected format. Additionally, consider using a more secure authentication mechanism, such as a password hash or a secure token-based system. Always validate user input before comparing it to hardcoded values or using it in database queries.  Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Consider using a library or framework that provides built-in security features, such as OWASP ESAPI or Apache Shiro.  Regularly review and update your code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with industry standards.
