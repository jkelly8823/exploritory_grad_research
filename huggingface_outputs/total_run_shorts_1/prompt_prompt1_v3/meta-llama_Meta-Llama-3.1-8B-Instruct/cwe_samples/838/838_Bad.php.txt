VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The use of user input directly in SQL queries and the lack of proper sanitization of user input in the HTML output make it susceptible to these types of attacks.
EXPLANATION: The code is directly inserting user input into SQL queries and HTML output without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code or JavaScript code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation. The use of `$_POST` variables directly in SQL queries and HTML output is a significant security risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the code should use a whitelist approach to sanitize user input in the HTML output, ensuring that only allowed characters are displayed. This can be achieved using functions like `htmlspecialchars()` or `filter_var()`. The code should also validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths. Finally, consider using a templating engine or a secure framework to handle user input and output securely.
