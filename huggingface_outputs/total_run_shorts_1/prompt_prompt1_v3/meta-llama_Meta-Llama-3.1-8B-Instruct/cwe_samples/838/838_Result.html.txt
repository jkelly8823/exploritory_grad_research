VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The 'onload' event handler is being used to execute JavaScript code that accesses the 'document.cookie' property, which can potentially leak sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The 'onload' event handler is being used to execute JavaScript code that accesses the 'document.cookie' property. This can potentially leak sensitive information, such as session IDs or authentication tokens, to an attacker. The 'alert' function is used to display the cookie value, but in a real-world scenario, an attacker could use this vulnerability to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'onload' event handler should be removed, and any necessary functionality should be implemented using a more secure approach, such as using a server-side language to handle the image loading and cookie access. Additionally, the 'document.cookie' property should not be accessed directly, and any sensitive information should be stored securely. It is also recommended to use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.  The 'alt' attribute should also be validated
