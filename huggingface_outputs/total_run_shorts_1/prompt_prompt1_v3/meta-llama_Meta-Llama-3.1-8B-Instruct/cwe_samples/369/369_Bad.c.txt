VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Division by zero vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The function divide() does not check if the divisor y is zero before performing the division. This can lead to a division by zero error if y is zero.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that y is not zero before performing the division. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if y is zero, and if so, return an error or handle it accordingly. For example: if (y == 0) { return 0; } else { return x/y; } or throw an exception.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The function divide() returns a double value, but the result of the division may exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a double. This can lead to an integer overflow error.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a data type that can handle larger values, such as a long double or a library that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Alternatively, use a library that can handle the division and prevent integer overflows.
