VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Division by zero vulnerability
Description of the vulnerability: This function does not check if the divisor (y) is zero before performing the division. If y is zero, the function will throw a DivideByZeroException.
EXPLANATION: The function is designed to divide two integers and return the result. However, it does not include any error checking to prevent division by zero. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if the divisor is zero.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that the divisor is not zero before performing the division. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if y is zero, and if so, return an error or throw an exception. For example: if (y == 0) { throw new DivideByZeroException("Cannot divide by zero"); } else { return x / y; }. This will prevent the division by zero vulnerability and ensure that the function behaves correctly.  ```csharp
