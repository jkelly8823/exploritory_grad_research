VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Division by zero vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The function computeAverageResponseTime() does not check if numRequests is zero before performing the division. If numRequests is zero, the function will throw an ArithmeticException.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that numRequests is not zero before performing the division. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if numRequests is greater than zero. If it is not, throw an exception or return an error message. Here is an example of how this can be done: if (numRequests == 0) { throw new ArithmeticException("numRequests cannot be zero"); } else { return totalTime / numRequests; } . 

VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANANATION: The function computeAverageResponseTime() returns an integer value, but the result of the division may exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. This can cause the function to return incorrect results or throw an exception.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Consider changing the return type of the function to a
