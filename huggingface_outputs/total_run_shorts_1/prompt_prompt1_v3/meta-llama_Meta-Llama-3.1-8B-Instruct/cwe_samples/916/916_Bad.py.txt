VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is not suitable for password storage. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the direct use of user input in the updateUserLogin function.
EXPLANATION: The MD5 hashing algorithm is not suitable for password storage because it is too fast and can be vulnerable to timing attacks. A timing attack is a type of attack where an attacker can determine the password by measuring the time it takes to hash the password. This is because different passwords will take different amounts of time to hash, and an attacker can use this information to guess the password. Additionally, the code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack because the updateUserLogin function is not properly sanitized. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the user input.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2. Additionally, the updateUserLogin function should be properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be done by using a parameterized query or by using an ORM that properly
