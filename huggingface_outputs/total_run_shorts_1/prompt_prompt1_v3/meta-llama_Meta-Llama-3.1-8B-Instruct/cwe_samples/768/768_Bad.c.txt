VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Add_Regular_Users function. The function allocates memory for num_users number of user_t structures, but then iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, assigning values to the structures. This can lead to a buffer overflow if num_users is greater than the actual number of user_t structures allocated.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the while loop condition is i && (users[i].privileges = PRIV_REGULAR), which will continue to execute as long as i is greater than or equal to 0. However, the array users is only allocated for num_users number of elements, so if num_users is greater than the actual number of user_t structures allocated, the loop will access memory outside the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the loop condition should be changed to i >= 0, and the loop should iterate over the array from the beginning to the end, assigning values to the structures. Additionally, the function should check if the allocation of memory was successful before attempting to access the array. The corrected code should
