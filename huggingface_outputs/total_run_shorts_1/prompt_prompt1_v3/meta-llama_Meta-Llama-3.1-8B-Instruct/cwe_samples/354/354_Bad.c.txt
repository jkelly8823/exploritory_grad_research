VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a UDP socket with a fixed port number. An attacker can send a large number of UDP packets to the server, causing it to become unresponsive.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a UDP socket with a fixed port number (1008), which makes it vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker can send a large number of UDP packets to the server, causing it to become unresponsive. This is because UDP is a connectionless protocol, and the server does not have a mechanism to limit the number of incoming packets.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a TCP socket instead of a UDP socket. This will allow the server to establish a connection with the client and limit the number of incoming packets. Additionally, the code should implement a mechanism to limit the number of incoming packets, such as a rate limiter or a packet filter. This will prevent the server from becoming unresponsive due to a large number of incoming packets. The code should also consider using a more secure protocol, such as TLS, to encrypt the
