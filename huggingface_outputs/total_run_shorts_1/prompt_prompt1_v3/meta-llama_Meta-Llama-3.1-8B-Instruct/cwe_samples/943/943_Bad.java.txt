VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A SQL injection vulnerability is present due to the direct concatenation of user input into a search filter.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates the user input 'address' into the search filter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the 'address' variable. For example, an attacker could inject a semicolon to terminate the current query and execute a new one.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a prepared statement or parameterized query to prevent SQL injection. In Java, you can use the `PreparedStatement` class to achieve this. For example: `String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=?"; PreparedStatement pstmt = context.prepareStatement(searchFilter); pstmt.setString(1, address);` This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, consider using a library like OWASP ESAPI to help prevent SQL injection and other types of attacks.
