VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input (userName and ItemName.Text) into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input values. For example, if an attacker enters a username like'OR 1=1 --', the query would become "SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = '' OR 1=1 --' AND itemname = '...'". This would return all items in the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. In this case, you can use the SqlCommand object with parameters to safely insert the user input into the SQL query. For example: string query = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE owner = @userName AND itemname = @itemName"; SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@userName", userName); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@itemName", ItemName.Text); sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);...
