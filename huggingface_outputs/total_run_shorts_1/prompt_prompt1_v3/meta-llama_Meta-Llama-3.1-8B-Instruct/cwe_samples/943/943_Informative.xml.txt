VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a hardcoded password, which is a security risk. Hardcoded passwords can be easily accessed by unauthorized users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two user elements with hardcoded passwords. The passwords are stored in plain text, which is a security risk. Hardcoded passwords should be avoided and replaced with secure password storage mechanisms, such as hashing and salting.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use a secure password storage mechanism, such as hashing and salting, to store passwords.
2. Avoid hardcoding passwords in the code.
3. Consider using a secure authentication framework to handle user authentication.  ```python
import hashlib
import os

def hash_password(password):
    # Generate a salt
    salt = os.urandom(32)
    # Hash the password with the salt
    hashed_password = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)
    # Return the salt and the hashed password
    return salt + hashed_password

def verify_password(stored_password, provided_password):
    # Extract the salt from the
