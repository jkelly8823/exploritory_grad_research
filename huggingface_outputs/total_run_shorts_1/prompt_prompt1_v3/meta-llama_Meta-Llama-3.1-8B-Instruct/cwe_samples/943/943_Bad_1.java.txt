VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and XPath Injection
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to both SQL Injection and XPath Injection. The XPath expression is vulnerable to XPath Injection because it directly incorporates user input into the XPath query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary XPath expressions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. The XPath expression is also vulnerable to SQL Injection because it uses the `evaluate()` method, which can execute arbitrary XPath expressions. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary XPath expressions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. Additionally, the code snippet uses a hardcoded file path ("db.xml") which could be a potential vulnerability if the file path is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use a prepared statement or parameterized XPath expression to prevent XPath Injection.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent XPath Injection.
3. Use a more secure method to parse the XML file, such as using a library that provides secure parsing and validation.
4. Avoid using hardcoded file paths and instead use a more secure method to load the XML file. 
5. Consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as using a
