VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The `killProcess` function checks if the process owner matches the current user, but it does not account for the possibility that the process owner may change between the time the check is made and the time the process is killed.
EXPLANATION: The `killProcess` function first checks if the process owner matches the current user. If it does, it kills the process. However, if the process owner does not match the current user, it prints an error message and returns without killing the process. This means that if the process owner changes between the time the check is made and the time the process is killed, the process may be killed even though it is not owned by the current user. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a lock to ensure that the process owner check and the process kill operations are atomic. This can be achieved by using a lock to synchronize access to the process owner check and the process kill operations. Alternatively, the code can use a more robust method to check the process owner, such as using a database or
