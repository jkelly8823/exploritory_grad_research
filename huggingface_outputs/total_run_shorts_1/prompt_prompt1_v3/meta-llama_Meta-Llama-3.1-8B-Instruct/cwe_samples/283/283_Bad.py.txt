VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function killProcess is vulnerable to a potential race condition. This is because the function does not check if the process with the given processID exists before attempting to kill it. If the process has already terminated between the time the function checks for its existence and the time it attempts to kill it, the function will raise an exception.
EXPLANATION: The function killProcess takes a processID as input and attempts to kill the process with that ID using the os.kill function. However, it does not check if the process with the given ID exists before attempting to kill it. This can lead to a race condition where the process has already terminated between the time the function checks for its existence and the time it attempts to kill it, resulting in an exception being raised.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check if the process with the given ID exists before attempting to kill it. This can be done by using the os.kill function with the signal.SIGTERM signal instead of SIGKILL, which will allow the process to terminate cleanly if it exists. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where the process does
