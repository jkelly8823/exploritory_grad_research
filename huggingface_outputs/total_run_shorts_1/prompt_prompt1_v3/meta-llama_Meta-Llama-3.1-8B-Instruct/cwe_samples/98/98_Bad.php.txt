VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks. An attacker can manipulate the'module_name' parameter to include malicious PHP files.
EXPLANATION: The code directly includes a file based on user input without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths, potentially leading to code execution or data exposure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a whitelist approach to validate the'module_name' parameter, ensuring it only includes allowed values. Alternatively, use a more secure method like autoloading or dependency injection to load files. Always sanitize and validate user input to prevent such vulnerabilities. Consider using a PHP framework that provides built-in security features to help mitigate such risks.  Use a function like `filter_var()` to validate the input and ensure it only includes allowed characters. For example: `$dir = filter_var($_GET['module_name'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);`  Also, consider using a more secure way to include files, such as using `require_once` or `include_once` with a full path to the file.  Always keep your PHP version up to date, as newer versions often include security patches for
