 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No SQL Injection vulnerability found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not appear to contain any code that is susceptible to SQL injection. The `getParameter` method is used to retrieve a parameter from the request, but it is not used in a way that would allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code appears to be secure in this regard. However, it is always a good practice to validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security issues. Consider using a prepared statement or a parameterized query to further secure the database interactions.
