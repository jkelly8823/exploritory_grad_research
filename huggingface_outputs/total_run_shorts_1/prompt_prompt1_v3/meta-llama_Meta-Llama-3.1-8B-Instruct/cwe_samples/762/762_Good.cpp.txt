VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory leak due to missing exception handling.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a memory leak due to the lack of exception handling. If an exception occurs between the creation of the BarObj and the deletion of the ptr, the memory allocated for the BarObj will not be released, resulting in a memory leak. This is because the delete statement is not inside a try-catch block, and if an exception occurs, the delete statement will not be executed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the delete statement should be placed inside a try-catch block to ensure that the memory is released even if an exception occurs. The corrected code should look like this: void foo(){ BarObj *ptr = new BarObj(); try { /* do some work with ptr here */... } catch (...) { /* handle exception */ } finally { delete ptr; } }. This will ensure that the memory is released regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. . 

Note: The code snippet is missing the closing bracket for the function foo(). I have assumed it to be at the end of the snippet. If it is not, please provide the
