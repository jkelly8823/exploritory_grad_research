VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability is present in this code. The pointer `ptr` is deleted before it is used.
EXPLANATION: The `delete` statement is called on the pointer `ptr` before it is used. This is a use-after-free vulnerability because the memory that `ptr` points to has already been deallocated. This can lead to undefined behavior when the program attempts to access the memory location pointed to by `ptr`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `delete` statement should be removed or moved to after the pointer is no longer used. Alternatively, the pointer should be set to `nullptr` after it is deleted to prevent further use. The corrected code should look like this: `void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));//delete ptr;}` or `void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));delete ptr;ptr = nullptr;}`.  The corrected code should look like this: `void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));//delete ptr;}` or `void A::foo(){
