VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory leak due to missing delete statement in the constructor.
EXPLANATION: The constructor of the BarObj class is not properly implemented. It should call the parent class's constructor using the : syntax. The missing delete statement in the constructor will cause a memory leak.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The constructor should be implemented as follows: BarObj::BarObj() : BarObj() { /* do some work with ptr here */ }. The delete statement should be moved to the destructor. The destructor should be implemented as follows: BarObj::~BarObj() { delete this; }. The code should be modified to use smart pointers to avoid memory leaks. For example, BarObj *ptr = std::unique_ptr<BarObj>(new BarObj());.  ```c
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
       /* do some work with ptr here */
       
      ...
       free(ptr);
}
```
