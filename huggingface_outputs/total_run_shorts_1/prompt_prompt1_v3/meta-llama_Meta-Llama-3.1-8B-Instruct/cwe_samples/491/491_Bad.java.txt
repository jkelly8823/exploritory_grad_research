VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack due to the direct use of user input in the construction of a new BankAccount object. This is a classic example of a "clone" method that is vulnerable to injection attacks.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the fact that the `accountnumber` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code or SQL commands by manipulating the `accountnumber` parameter. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or even system compromise.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `accountnumber` parameter should be properly validated and sanitized before being used to construct a new BankAccount object. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to ensure the input matches a specific format, or by using a secure method to parse the input. Additionally, the `clone` method should be modified to accept only the necessary parameters and avoid using user input directly in the construction of the new object. For example, the method could be modified to accept a `BankAccount` object as a parameter, rather than a `String` account number. This would prevent the injection of malicious code or SQL commands
