VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a potential CloneNotSupportedException. The clone() method is declared to throw CloneNotSupportedException, but it does not contain any code to handle this exception. This can lead to a runtime exception being thrown if the object being cloned is not cloneable.
EXPLANATION: The clone() method is declared to throw CloneNotSupportedException, but it does not contain any code to handle this exception. This can lead to a runtime exception being thrown if the object being cloned is not cloneable. The clone() method should either handle the exception or declare it to not throw the exception.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The clone() method should either handle the CloneNotSupportedException by implementing the Cloneable interface and overriding the clone() method to handle the exception, or it should declare it to not throw the CloneNotSupportedException by removing the throws clause. For example: protected Object clone() {... } or protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException { try {... } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {... } }.
