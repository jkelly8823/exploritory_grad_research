VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of sscanf() with a user-controlled input string. The sscanf() function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The sscanf() function is used to parse the user-controlled input string "untrusted_input" into two integers "m" and "n". However, the sscanf() function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer function such as fscanf() or fgets() to read the input string, and then use a function like sscanf() to parse the input string. Alternatively, the code can use a library like libmagic to detect the type of the input string and handle it accordingly. Additionally, the code should validate the input string to ensure it conforms to the expected format. The code should also consider using a safer function like fscanf() with a format string that specifies the maximum number of characters
