 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability exists due to the potential for a race condition between the authentication and admin checks. If the admin check is performed after the authentication check, but before the admin check is evaluated, an attacker could potentially delete a user by manipulating the admin status of the user being deleted.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the admin check is performed after the authentication check. If an attacker can manipulate the admin status of the user being deleted between the authentication and admin checks, they could delete a user even if they are not authenticated or an admin. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using transactions or locks to ensure that the admin check is performed before the authentication check. Alternatively, you could reorder the checks so that the admin check is performed before the authentication check. This would prevent an attacker from manipulating the admin status of the user being deleted. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from manipulating the user being deleted.  ```bash
                  if (authenticate($username,$password) && setAdmin($username)){$isAdmin = true;}
                     /.../
