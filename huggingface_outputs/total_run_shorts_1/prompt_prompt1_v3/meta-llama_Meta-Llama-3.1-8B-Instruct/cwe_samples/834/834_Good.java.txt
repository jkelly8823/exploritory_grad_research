VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly validate the rateSold variable. It only checks if the rateSold is less than 1, but it does not check if it is greater than the maximum allowed value. This could lead to a potential vulnerability if the rateSold is set to a value outside of the expected range.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided checks if the rateSold variable is less than 1, but it does not check if it is greater than the maximum allowed value. This could lead to a potential vulnerability if the rateSold is set to a value outside of the expected range. For example, if the maximum allowed value is 100, and the rateSold is set to 101, the code will not catch this error and may lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if the rateSold is within the expected range. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the rateSold is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the maximum allowed value. For example: if (rateSold < 1 || rateSold > 100) {return
