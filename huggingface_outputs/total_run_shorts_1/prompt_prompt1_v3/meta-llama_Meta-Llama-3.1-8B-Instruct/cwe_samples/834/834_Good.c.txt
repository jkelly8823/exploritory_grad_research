VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a stack overflow error due to a recursive function call without a proper base case.
EXPLANATION: The function do_something_recursive calls itself recursively without checking if the input parameter flg is 0. This can lead to an infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow error. The function does not have a proper base case to stop the recursion when the input parameter flg is 0.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a base case to the function to stop the recursion when the input parameter flg is 0. For example, you can add a condition to check if flg is 0 before calling the function recursively. If flg is 0, the function can return immediately without calling itself again. This will prevent the infinite recursion and stack overflow error. Here is an example of how the modified function could look like: ```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
 ...
  if (flg == 0) return; // Add a base case to stop the recursion
  if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }
}
```
