VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to an infinite recursion caused by the unmodified value of the flag variable.
EXPLANATION: The function do_something_recursive() calls itself recursively without modifying the value of the flag variable. As a result, the function will continue to call itself indefinitely until the stack is exhausted, causing a stack overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the value of the flag variable should be modified within the function to prevent infinite recursion. This can be achieved by decrementing the flag variable within the function, for example: if (flg) { flg--; do_something_recursive (flg); } This will ensure that the function will eventually terminate and prevent a stack overflow. Alternatively, the function can be modified to use a loop instead of recursion to achieve the same result.  ```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
  ... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
   if (flg) { flg--; do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is modified so it will eventually be FALSE and
