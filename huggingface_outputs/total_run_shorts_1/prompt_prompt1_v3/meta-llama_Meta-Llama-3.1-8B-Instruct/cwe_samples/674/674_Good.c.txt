VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a stack overflow error due to a recursive function call without a proper base case.
EXPLANATION: The function do_something_recursive calls itself recursively without checking if the flag has reached a base case. This can lead to a stack overflow error if the flag does not change to 0. The function will continue to call itself indefinitely, consuming more and more stack space until the program crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a base case to the recursive function call. For example, you can add a condition to check if the flag has reached a certain value, and if so, return from the function. Additionally, consider using an iterative approach instead of recursion to avoid stack overflow errors. ```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
  if (flg == 0) return; // Add a base case
 ... // Do some real work here
  if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }
}
``` ```c
void do_something_iterative (int flg)
{
  while (flg) {
   ... // Do some real
