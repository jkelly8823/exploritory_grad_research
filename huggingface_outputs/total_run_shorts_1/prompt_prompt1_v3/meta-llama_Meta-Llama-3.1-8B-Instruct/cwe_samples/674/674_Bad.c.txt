VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a vulnerability known as a "Stack Overflow" or "Infinite Recursion" vulnerability. This occurs when a function calls itself without any terminating condition, leading to a stack overflow error.
EXPLANATION: The function `do_something_recursive` calls itself recursively without modifying the value of `flg`. As a result, the function will continue to call itself indefinitely until the stack is exhausted, causing a stack overflow error. This is a classic example of an infinite recursion vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function `do_something_recursive` should be modified to include a terminating condition that will stop the recursion. This can be achieved by modifying the value of `flg` within the function, or by adding a conditional statement to check for a specific condition that will terminate the recursion. For example, the function could be modified to decrement the value of `flg` on each recursive call, or to check if `flg` is equal to a certain value before making the recursive call. Additionally, the function could be modified to use a loop instead of recursion to avoid the risk of a stack overflow error.
