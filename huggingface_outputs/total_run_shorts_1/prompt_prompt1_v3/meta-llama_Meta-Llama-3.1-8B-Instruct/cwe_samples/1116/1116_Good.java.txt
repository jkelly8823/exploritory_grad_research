VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to an integer overflow error. If the product of pt_weight and mg_per_kg exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an integer, the daily_dose will be incorrect.
EXPLANATION: The code multiplies two integers to calculate the daily dose. However, if the product of these integers exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an integer, the daily_dose will wrap around to a smaller value, resulting in an incorrect calculation. This can occur if the patient weight or the Mg/Kg ratio is very large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should use a data type that can handle larger values, such as long or BigInteger. Alternatively, the code could use a library that provides support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Additionally, the code could add input validation to prevent very large values from being used in the calculation.  The line with the issue is daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg; which should be changed to daily_dose = (long)pt_weight * mg_per_kg; to prevent the overflow.  The return statement is also incorrect as dosage is not
