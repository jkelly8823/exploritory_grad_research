VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and Password Storage Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user input in the SetUserPassword function. The user input is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Additionally, the password is stored in plain text, which is a security risk. An attacker who gains access to the password database can obtain all passwords.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. 
2. Hash and store passwords securely using a library like bcrypt or Argon2. 
3. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious SQL code from being injected. 
4. Consider using a secure password hashing library to handle password storage. 
5. Regularly review and update the password storage mechanism to ensure it remains secure. 
6. Consider implementing additional security measures such as two-factor authentication and account lockout policies. 
7. Ensure that the SetUserPassword function is properly secured and validated to prevent unauthorized access. 
8. Consider using a secure authentication library to handle user authentication and password storage. 
9. Regular
