VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the presence of a debug mode that allows arbitrary code execution. The debug mode is enabled by setting the "debug" POST variable to "true", which can be done by any user. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code, potentially leading to a security breach.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a function called "login" that is vulnerable due to the presence of a debug mode. When the debug mode is enabled, the function executes the "phpinfo()" function, which displays detailed information about the PHP environment. This can be exploited by an attacker to gather sensitive information about the system. Additionally, the function sets the "$isAdmin" variable to True, which can be used to bypass authentication checks. This is a serious security risk and should be addressed immediately.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the debug mode should be removed or restricted to a specific IP address or user group. The "phpinfo()" function should be replaced with a safer alternative, such as a custom debug function that only displays relevant information. The "$isAdmin" variable should be removed or set
