VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential NullPointerException (NPE) if the system property "com.domain.application.debugLevel" is not set or is set to a non-integer value.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to retrieve the value of the system property "com.domain.application.debugLevel" and convert it to an integer using the Integer.getInteger() method. However, if the system property is not set or is set to a non-integer value, this method will return null, and calling intValue() on null will result in a NullPointerException.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a null check before calling intValue() on the result of Integer.getInteger(). You can also consider using a try-catch block to catch and handle the potential NullPointerException. Additionally, you should consider using a more robust method to retrieve the debug level, such as using a configuration file or a database, rather than relying on a system property.
