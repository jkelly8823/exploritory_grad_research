VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The equals method is vulnerable to a NullPointerException when the object being compared is null, and it is also vulnerable to a ClassCastException when the object being compared is not an instance of Truck. Additionally, the equals method does not handle the case where the make or model of the Truck is null, which can lead to a NullPointerException.
EXPLANATION: The equals method in the provided code snippet is not properly implemented. It does not follow the general contract of the equals method as specified in the Java API. The method should return false if the object being compared is null, and it should return true if the object being compared is the same instance as the current object. The method should also handle the case where the make or model of the Truck is null. Furthermore, the method should use the equals method of the String class to compare the make and model of the two Truck objects.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the equals method should be modified to handle the case where the object being compared is null, and it should handle the case where the make or model of the Truck is null. The method should also use the equals method of the String
