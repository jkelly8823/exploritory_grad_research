VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a cookie tampering attack. An attacker could modify the ACCOUNT_ID cookie to gain unauthorized access to the account.
EXPLANATION: The code creates a new Cookie object with the ACCOUNT_ID and acctID values. However, it does not validate or sanitize the input values. An attacker could modify the ACCOUNT_ID cookie to gain unauthorized access to the account. This is a classic example of a cookie tampering attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input values before creating the Cookie object. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed values for the ACCOUNT_ID cookie or by using a secure method to generate the cookie value. Additionally, the code should use the HttpServletRequest object to get the cookie value, rather than relying on user input. This will help to prevent cookie tampering attacks. The code should also consider using a secure cookie protocol, such as HTTPS, to prevent cookie tampering over insecure connections.  The code should also consider using a secure cookie flag, such as HttpOnly, to prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie.  The code should also consider using a secure cookie expiration,
