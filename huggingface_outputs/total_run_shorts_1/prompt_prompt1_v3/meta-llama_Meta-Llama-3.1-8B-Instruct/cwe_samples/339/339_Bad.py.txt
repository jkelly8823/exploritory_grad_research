VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of a fixed seed for the random number generator can lead to predictable and reproducible results, which can be exploited by attackers.
EXPLANATION: The line `random.seed(a=seed)` sets the seed for the random number generator. However, the seed is generated using `os.urandom(2)`, which only generates 2 bytes of randomness. This is insufficient to provide a truly random seed, and can lead to predictable results. Additionally, the use of `random.getrandbits(128)` to generate a key of 128 bits is not sufficient to mitigate this issue, as the seed is still fixed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a seed, such as `secrets.token_bytes(32)`. This will provide a truly random seed and mitigate the predictability of the random number generator. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to generate the key, such as `secrets.token_bytes(128)`.  Also, consider using a secure random number generator like `secrets` module instead of `random` module.  ```python
import secrets
