VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack due to the direct comparison of user input with a hardcoded password. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input password.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a function VerifyAdmin that takes a String password as input and checks if it matches a hardcoded password "Mew!". However, this approach is insecure as it allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input password. For example, an attacker could input a password like "Mew!' OR 1=1" which would cause the function to return 1 even if the password is incorrect. This is a classic example of a SQL injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a secure password comparison method, such as using a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2. The function should also be modified to handle errors and exceptions properly. Additionally, the use of a hardcoded password is not recommended and should be replaced with a secure password storage mechanism. The code should be refactored to use a more secure approach, such as using a password verification library or a
