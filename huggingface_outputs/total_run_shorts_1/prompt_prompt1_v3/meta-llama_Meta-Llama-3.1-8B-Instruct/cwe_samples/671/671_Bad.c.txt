VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `strcmp` function without checking its return value. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code by providing a long password.
EXPLANATION: The `strcmp` function compares two strings and returns an integer value indicating their relationship. However, if the attacker provides a password that is longer than the buffer allocated for the password, the function will continue to compare the strings beyond the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations with arbitrary data. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of `strcmp` to ensure that it does not exceed the buffer size. Additionally, consider using a safer function like `strncmp` to limit the comparison to a specific number of characters. The code should also be modified to handle passwords of varying lengths, rather than assuming a fixed length. Finally, consider using a more secure method of storing and comparing passwords, such as hashing and salting.
