VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A stack overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of bounds checking when incrementing the p1 pointer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a stack implementation with a fixed size of 50 elements. However, the push function does not check if the stack is full before incrementing the p1 pointer. This can lead to a stack overflow when the stack is full, causing undefined behavior. The pop function also does not check if the stack is empty before decrementing the p1 pointer, which can lead to a stack underflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to the push function to prevent incrementing the p1 pointer when the stack is full. This can be done by checking if p1 is equal to tos + SIZE before incrementing it. Additionally, add bounds checking to the pop function to prevent decrementing the p1 pointer when the stack is empty. This can be done by checking if p1 is equal to tos before decrementing it. The corrected push function should look like this: if(p1 < tos + SIZE) p1++; and the corrected pop function should look like this:
