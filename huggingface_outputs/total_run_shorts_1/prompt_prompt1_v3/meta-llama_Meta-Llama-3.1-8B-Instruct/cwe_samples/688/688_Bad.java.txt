VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The accessGranted method is vulnerable to a potential NullPointerException when the userRoles array is null. This is because the method does not check for null before attempting to access the array.
EXPLANATION: The accessGranted method is called recursively, and the userRoles array is passed from the outer method to the inner method. However, the inner method does not check if the userRoles array is null before attempting to access it. If the userRoles array is null, a NullPointerException will be thrown.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the accessGranted method should be modified to check if the userRoles array is null before attempting to access it. This can be done by adding a simple null check at the beginning of the method. For example: if (userRoles == null) { return false; } or if (userRoles!= null && userRoles.length == 0) { return false; } depending on the desired behavior. Additionally, it would be a good practice to handle the case where the userRoles array is null in the outer method, to prevent the NullPointerException from being thrown in the first place. This can be done by checking if the userRoles
