VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a race condition vulnerability in the `save_config_state` and `restore_config_state` functions. 
EXPLANATION: In the `save_config_state` function, after calling `get_config_state()` and `save_config_state(cfg)`, the code does not wait for the `save_config_state(cfg)` operation to complete before proceeding to calculate the hash of the configuration state. This introduces a window of opportunity for another thread or process to modify the configuration state after it has been saved, but before its hash has been calculated and saved. Similarly, in the `restore_config_state` function, the code does not wait for the `load_config_file(cfg)` operation to complete before proceeding to compare the hashes. This introduces a window of opportunity for another thread or process to modify the configuration file after it has been loaded, but before its hash can be compared with the persisted hash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix the race condition vulnerability, the code should be modified to ensure that the `save_config_state(cfg)` operation completes before proceeding to calculate the hash of the configuration state. This can be achieved by using synchronization primitives such as locks
