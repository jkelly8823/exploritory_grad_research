VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the save_config_state function. This is because the cfg pointer is being dereferenced after it has been freed.
EXPLANATION: In the save_config_state function, the cfg pointer is first assigned the result of get_config_state(). However, the cfg pointer is then immediately passed to the save_config_state function, which will attempt to free the memory pointed to by cfg. Once this memory is freed, any further attempts to access or manipulate it will result in undefined behavior. This is a classic example of a use-after-free vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the save_config_state function should not attempt to free the memory pointed to by cfg. Instead, it should make a copy of the config state and free the original memory. Alternatively, the function could return the config state and let the caller handle the memory management. The restore_config_state function also has a potential issue. The load_config_file function may attempt to free the memory pointed to by cfg, but the cfg pointer is still being used in the load_config_file function. This could result in a use-after-free vulnerability. To fix
