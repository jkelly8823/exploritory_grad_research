VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A memory leak is possible if the malloc call fails, and the program continues to execute.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet allocates memory for an array of img_t structs using malloc. However, it does not check the return value of malloc to ensure that the allocation was successful. If malloc fails, it will return a null pointer, and the program will continue to execute with a dangling pointer. This can lead to a memory leak if the program attempts to access the memory location pointed to by table_ptr.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the return value of malloc and handle the case where it returns a null pointer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if table_ptr is null before using it. For example: if ((table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs)) == NULL) { /* handle error */ } else { /* use table_ptr */ }. Additionally, it's a good practice to use a more robust memory allocation function, such as realloc, which can help prevent memory leaks.
