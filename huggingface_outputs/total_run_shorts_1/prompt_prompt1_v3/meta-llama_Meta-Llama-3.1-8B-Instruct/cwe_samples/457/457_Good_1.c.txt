VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a pointer to a string literal without proper bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a pointer to a string literal ("Hello World!") and assigns it to the variable test_string. However, the string literal is stored in read-only memory, and modifying it can lead to undefined behavior. Furthermore, the code does not check the bounds of the string before printing it, which can cause a buffer overflow if the string is longer than expected.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a character array instead of a pointer to a string literal. Also, check the bounds of the string before printing it to prevent buffer overflows. For example, you can use the strlen() function to get the length of the string and then use a loop to print it character by character. Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like: char test_string[100]; if (i!= err_val) { test_string = "Hello World!"; } else { test_string = "Done on the other side!"; } printf("%s", test_string); // Corrected code:
