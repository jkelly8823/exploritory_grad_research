VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a Referer Header Injection attack. An attacker could manipulate the referer field in the HTTP request to inject malicious code or data.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable because it directly compares the referer field of the HTTP request to a hardcoded string. An attacker could manipulate the referer field to inject malicious code or data. This is a classic example of a Referer Header Injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the referer field against a whitelist of trusted domains. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides referer validation functionality. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a more secure method of validating the referer field, such as by checking the referer field against a database of trusted domains. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle cases where the referer field is missing or empty. This can be done by adding a check for null or empty referer field before comparing it to the trusted referer string. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the definition of the variables "newsock", "buffer", "BUFSIZE", "requestPacket
