VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential command injection vulnerability. This is because the `arg` slice is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
EXPLANATION: The `exec.Command` function is used to execute a command with the given arguments. However, the `arg` slice is not sanitized or validated, which means an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `arg` slice. This could lead to unintended behavior or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `arg` slice should be sanitized and validated to ensure that only expected arguments are passed to the command. This can be done by using a whitelist approach, where only specific arguments are allowed, or by using a library that provides argument sanitization and validation. Additionally, the `exec.Command` function should be used with caution and only with trusted input. Consider using a safer alternative, such as `os/exec.CommandContext` with a context that has a timeout and cancellation mechanism.  Also, the `exec.LookPath` function should be used with caution as it can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. Consider using a safer alternative, such as `
