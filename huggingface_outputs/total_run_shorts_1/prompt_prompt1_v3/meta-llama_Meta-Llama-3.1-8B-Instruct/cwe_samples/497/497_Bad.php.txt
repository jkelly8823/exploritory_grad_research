VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to command injection due to the use of the system function with user input. The getCurrentUser() function returns a username that is concatenated into a command string, which is then executed using the system function. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the username, leading to unintended consequences.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer method to execute commands, such as using a library that properly sanitizes user input. Alternatively, use a more secure method to execute commands, such as using a whitelist of allowed commands. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to get the current user, such as using a session or authentication mechanism. The system function should be avoided whenever possible due to its inherent security risks.  The use of the system function with user input is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability. It is recommended to use a more secure method to execute commands, such as using a library that properly sanitizes user input.
