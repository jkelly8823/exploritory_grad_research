VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack. An attacker can manipulate the user input to access sensitive files on the server.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the user input from the $_POST["user"] variable directly in the system command without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input and access sensitive files on the server. The system function executes the command, which can lead to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the user input before using it in the system command. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensuring that the input only contains allowed characters. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to execute the command, such as using a library that allows for safe execution of shell commands. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not have any other security issues.
