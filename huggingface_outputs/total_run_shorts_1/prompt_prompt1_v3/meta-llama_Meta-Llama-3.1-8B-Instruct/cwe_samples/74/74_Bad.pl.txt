VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. An attacker can manipulate the filename to inject arbitrary commands.
EXPLANATION: The system function is used to execute a command. However, the command is constructed by concatenating the filename with the command string. An attacker can manipulate the filename to inject arbitrary commands, potentially leading to a command injection attack. This is because the system function does not perform any sanitization or validation of the command string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a safer method to execute the command, such as using a Perl module like IPC::System::Simple. Alternatively, use a library like File::Spec to construct the command string in a safe manner. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the filename and ensure it only contains allowed characters. For example, you can use a regular expression to match the filename against a set of allowed characters. 

Note: The validate_name function is not sufficient to prevent command injection attacks, as it only checks if the filename contains alphanumeric characters and hyphens. An attacker can still manipulate the filename to inject arbitrary commands. 

Also, the use of system function is
