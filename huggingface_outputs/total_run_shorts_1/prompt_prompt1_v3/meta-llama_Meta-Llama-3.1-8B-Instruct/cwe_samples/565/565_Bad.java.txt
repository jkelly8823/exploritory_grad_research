VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a cookie tampering attack. An attacker can manipulate the "role" cookie to gain unauthorized access to the system.
EXPLANATION: The code retrieves cookies from the request and checks if the "role" cookie exists. However, it does not verify the authenticity of the cookie. An attacker can easily manipulate the cookie value to gain unauthorized access to the system. This is a classic example of a cookie tampering attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a secure method to verify the authenticity of the cookie, such as using a digital signature or a secure cookie store. Additionally, you should validate the cookie value to ensure it conforms to the expected format. You can also consider using a secure cookie library that provides built-in protection against tampering attacks.
