VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded credentials are present in the code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded credentials for a web application's LDAP username and password. This is a security risk because if an attacker gains access to the code, they will also gain access to the credentials. Hardcoded credentials should be avoided and instead, stored securely using environment variables or a secrets management system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secrets management system. For example, you can use the `System.getenv()` method in Java to retrieve the credentials from environment variables. Alternatively, you can use a secrets management system like HashiCorp's Vault to securely store and retrieve the credentials. Always ensure that sensitive information is not committed to version control. Consider using a tool like Git Secrets to mask sensitive information in the code.  Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  Always use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Always use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.  Always keep your dependencies up to date to prevent known vulnerabilities.  Always use a secure protocol (HTTPS
