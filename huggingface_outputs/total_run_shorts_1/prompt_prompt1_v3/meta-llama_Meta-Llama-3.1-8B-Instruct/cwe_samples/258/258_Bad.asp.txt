VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The password for the database connection is hardcoded and visible in the source code, which is a security risk.
EXPLANATION: The password for the database connection is hardcoded in the connectionString attribute of the add element. This means that anyone with access to the source code can see the password, which is a security risk. Hardcoding passwords in source code is a common security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a secure method to store the password, such as environment variables or a secrets manager. This will prevent the password from being visible in the source code. Additionally, consider using a connection string builder to construct the connection string at runtime, rather than hardcoding it in the source code. This will make it more difficult for an attacker to obtain the password.  ```csharp
string connectionString = $"connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd={Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DB_PASSWORD")}; dbalias=uDB;";
```  ```java
String connectionString = "connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=" + System.getenv("DB_PASSWORD") + "; dbalias=uDB;";
```  ```python
