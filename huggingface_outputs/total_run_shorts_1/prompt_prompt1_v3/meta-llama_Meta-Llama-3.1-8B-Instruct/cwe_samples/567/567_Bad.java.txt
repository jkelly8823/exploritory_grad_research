VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The Counter servlet is vulnerable to a race condition due to the shared static variable count. Multiple threads accessing the servlet simultaneously may result in an inconsistent count.
EXPLANATION: The Counter servlet uses a shared static variable count to keep track of the number of hits. However, this variable is not thread-safe. When multiple threads access the servlet simultaneously, they may increment the count variable at the same time, resulting in an inconsistent count. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially cause the servlet to malfunction.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the shared static variable count should be replaced with a thread-safe alternative, such as an AtomicInteger. The updated code should look like this: static AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0); count.incrementAndGet();. This ensures that the count is incremented atomically, preventing the race condition. Additionally, consider using a more robust synchronization mechanism, such as a lock, to ensure thread safety in the servlet.
