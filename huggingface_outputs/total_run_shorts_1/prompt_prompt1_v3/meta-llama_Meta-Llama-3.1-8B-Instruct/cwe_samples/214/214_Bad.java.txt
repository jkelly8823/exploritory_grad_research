VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential information disclosure attack. The password for the keystore is being retrieved from an environment variable, which could be accessible to an attacker. This could allow an attacker to gain access to the keystore and potentially compromise the security of the application.
EXPLANATION: The code is using the `System.getProperty()` method to retrieve the keystore password from an environment variable. This is a potential security risk because an attacker could potentially access the environment variable and obtain the password. This could allow the attacker to access the keystore and potentially compromise the security of the application. It is recommended to use a more secure method to store and retrieve sensitive information such as passwords.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Instead of retrieving the password from an environment variable, consider using a more secure method such as a configuration file or a secrets management system. Additionally, consider using a secure way to store the password, such as hashing and salting it. It is also recommended to validate the input of the password to ensure it is not null or empty.
