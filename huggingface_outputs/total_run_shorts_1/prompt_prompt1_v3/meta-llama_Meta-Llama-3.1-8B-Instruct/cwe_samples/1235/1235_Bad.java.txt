VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Inefficient use of memory and potential for integer overflow. The loop iterates until Integer.MAX_VALUE which is a large number and can lead to integer overflow when the count is incremented.
EXPLANATION: The loop iterates over a large range of numbers which can lead to inefficient use of memory and potential integer overflow. This can be mitigated by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a more efficient algorithm or data structure to calculate the sum, such as using a streaming approach or a data structure designed for large sums, like a long array. Alternatively, you can use a library function that is optimized for large sums. If you must use a loop, consider using a smaller range or a more efficient increment operation.  Consider using a more robust data type, such as BigInteger, to handle large sums.  Consider using a more efficient data type, such as long, instead of using Integer.MAX_VALUE.
