VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the direct execution of user input in the database connection.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to open a database connection using the openDbConnection() function. However, if an exception occurs, it catches the exception and prints the exception message. The exception message is directly printed to the screen, which could potentially reveal sensitive information about the database configuration. Furthermore, the code does not properly sanitize or validate the user input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the exception message to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly handle exceptions and prevent direct execution of user input. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input. Additionally, the code should be modified to not print sensitive information, such as database configuration details, to the screen. Instead, it should log the exception and provide a generic error message to the user. The code should also be modified to validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks. For
