VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to CWE-22: Path Traversal and CWE-78: OS Command Injection.
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to CWE-22 because it uses a regular expression to validate the username, but it does not properly sanitize the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious characters into the username, which can be used to traverse the file system. The code is also vulnerable to CWE-78 because it uses the `ExitError` function to execute a command, which can be used to inject malicious commands. This is a classic example of an OS command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to validate the username, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters. Additionally, the code should use a parameterized query or a library that properly escapes user input to prevent OS command injection. The `ExitError` function should be replaced with a more secure method of handling errors, such as using a try-catch block. Finally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other vulnerabilities.
