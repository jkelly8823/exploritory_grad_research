 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the presence of duplicate form names. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues when submitting the forms.
EXPLANATION: In HTML, form names must be unique within a document. The presence of duplicate form names can cause the browser to submit the last form with the given name, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. This is a common issue in web development and can be easily overlooked.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the form names should be made unique. This can be achieved by renaming one of the forms to a unique name, such as "ProjectForm1" or "ProjectForm2". It is also a good practice to use a more robust method of handling form submissions, such as using a unique identifier for each form.
