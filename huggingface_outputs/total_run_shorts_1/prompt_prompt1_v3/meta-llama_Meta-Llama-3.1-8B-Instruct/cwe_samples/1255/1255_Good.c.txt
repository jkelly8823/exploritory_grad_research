 


VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to an infinite loop that can be triggered when the user has no more password tries.
EXPLANATION: The code contains a while loop that will continue indefinitely if the user has no more password tries. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the system to hang, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The loop condition should be changed to check for the number of password tries remaining, rather than checking if the number of tries is zero. This can be achieved by replacing the line "while (password_tries == 0)" with "while (password_tries > 0)". Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that there are no other potential DoS vulnerabilities. 

Please note that this response is based on the provided code snippet and may not be comprehensive or accurate in the context of the entire project.  It is recommended to review the code thoroughly and consider additional security measures to prevent DoS attacks.  Further analysis may be necessary to identify all potential vulnerabilities.
