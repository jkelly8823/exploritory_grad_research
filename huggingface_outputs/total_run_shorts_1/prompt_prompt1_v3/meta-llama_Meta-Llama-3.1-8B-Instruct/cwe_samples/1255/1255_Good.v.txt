VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition between the rising edge of the clock and the rising edge of the reset signal. This is because both signals are used to trigger the always block, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.
EXPLANATION: 
The issue arises because the always block is triggered by both the rising edge of the clock (posedge clk) and the rising edge of the reset signal (posedge rst). When the reset signal rises, the code will set q to 0, but then immediately check the value of a. However, since the reset signal has already risen, the code will be executing on the next clock cycle, and the value of q will be the previous value of a, not the new value. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially if the reset signal is asserted for multiple clock cycles.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Remove the reset signal from the sensitivity list of the always block. This can be done by changing the line `always@(posedge clk,posedge rst)` to `always@(posedge clk)`.
2. Use a more traditional reset procedure, such as using a separate reset signal that is
