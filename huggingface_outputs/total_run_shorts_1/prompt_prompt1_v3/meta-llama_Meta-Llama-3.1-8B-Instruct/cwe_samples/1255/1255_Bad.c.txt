VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential infinite loop vulnerability due to the use of a busy-wait loop with a condition that can be false for an extended period. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or a resource exhaustion condition.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a busy-wait loop that continues to execute until the condition `password_tries == 0` is met. However, this condition is not guaranteed to be met in a timely manner, as it depends on the user's password input. If the user enters an incorrect password, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely, leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack or resource exhaustion condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more efficient and non-blocking approach, such as using a timer or a separate thread to handle the password input and validation. Additionally, consider implementing a maximum number of retries to prevent resource exhaustion. The code should also be refactored to remove the busy-wait loop and instead use a more responsive and user-friendly approach to handle password input and validation.  The line `password_tr
