VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a NullPointerException when comparing two null BankAccount objects. It is also vulnerable to a ClassCastException when comparing two BankAccount objects of different classes that implement the BankAccount interface.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Use the equals() method to compare the two BankAccount objects. This method is overridden in the BankAccount class to provide a correct comparison. If the equals() method is not overridden, then it should be. The equals() method should also handle the case where one or both of the objects being compared are null. The equals() method should also handle the case where the two objects being compared are of different classes that implement the BankAccount interface. The equals() method should also handle the case where the two objects being compared are of different classes that implement the BankAccount interface.
