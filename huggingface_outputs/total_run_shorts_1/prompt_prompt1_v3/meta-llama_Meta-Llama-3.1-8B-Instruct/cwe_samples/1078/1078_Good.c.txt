 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The fgets function does not prevent the buffer from overflowing if the user enters a string longer than MAX_BUFFER_SIZE. This is because fgets only stops reading when it encounters a newline character, which may not be present if the user enters a string longer than MAX_BUFFER_SIZE.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like fgets with a length parameter to prevent buffer overflows, or use a function like getline to read the entire line without a fixed buffer size. Consider using a library like libmagic to detect the type of the input and handle it accordingly. Alternatively, consider using a safer function like gets or fgets with a length parameter. If you're working with a fixed-size buffer, consider checking the return value of fgets to ensure it didn't overflow the buffer.
