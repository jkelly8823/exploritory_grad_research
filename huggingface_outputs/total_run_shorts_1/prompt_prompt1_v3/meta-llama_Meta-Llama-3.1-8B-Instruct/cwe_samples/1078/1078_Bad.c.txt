VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: This vulnerability exists because the fgets function reads input from the standard input stream and stores it in the buffer. However, the buffer is fixed-size, and if the user inputs a string longer than 1023 characters, it will overflow the buffer. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like fgets with a dynamically allocated buffer, or use a library like scanf that allows for more precise control over input length. Alternatively, consider using a safer function like getline or getdelim from the POSIX standard. If you must use a fixed-size buffer, consider using a smaller size and adding bounds checking to prevent overflows. Also, always validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential attacks. Consider using a secure coding library or framework to help with this.
