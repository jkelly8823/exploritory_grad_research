VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path traversal vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `getInputPath()` method is not validated, and the `startsWith()` method is used to check if the path starts with "/safe_dir/". However, an attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to traverse outside of the intended directory by using directory traversal sequences such as "../" or "/../". This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files or directories outside of the intended scope.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input path to ensure it does not contain any directory traversal sequences. This can be done by using a library such as Apache Commons Lang's `StringUtils` class to check if the path contains any suspicious characters. Additionally, the code should use a more robust method to check if the path is within the intended directory, such as using a regular expression to match the path against a whitelist of allowed directories. Finally, the code should consider using a more secure method to retrieve the canonical path, such as using the `Paths.get()` method from the `java.nio.file` package.
