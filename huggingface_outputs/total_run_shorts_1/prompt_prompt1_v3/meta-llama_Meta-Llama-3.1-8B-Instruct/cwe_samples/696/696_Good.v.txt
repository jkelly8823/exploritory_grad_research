 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of non-blocking assignments in a clocked process.
EXPLANATION: The code uses non-blocking assignments (e.g., `assign grant_access =...`) in a clocked process (`always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)`). This can lead to a race condition because the assignments are not guaranteed to be executed in the order they are written. In this case, the assignment to `grant_access` may be executed before the assignment to `data_out`, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use blocking assignments instead of non-blocking assignments. For example, replace `assign grant_access =...` with `grant_access =...`. Additionally, consider using a blocking assignment for the assignment to `data_out` as well, to ensure that it is executed after the assignment to `grant_access`. For example, replace `data_out =...` with `data_out <=...`. This will ensure that the assignments are executed in the correct order, preventing the potential race condition.
