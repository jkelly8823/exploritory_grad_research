 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of non-blocking assignments in the always block.
EXPLANATION: The code uses non-blocking assignments in the always block, which can lead to a race condition. This is because the assignments are not guaranteed to be executed in the order they are written. In this case, the assignment of grant_access is not guaranteed to be executed before the assignment of data_out, which can lead to incorrect behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be rewritten to use blocking assignments instead of non-blocking assignments. This can be done by replacing the non-blocking assignments with blocking assignments, or by using a different design pattern that avoids the use of non-blocking assignments altogether. For example, the code could be rewritten as follows: always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin if (!rst_n) data_out = 0; else if (grant_access) data_out = data_in; end assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4)? 1'b1 : 1'b0; This rewritten code uses blocking assignments and avoids the use of non-blocking assignments,
