VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path traversal vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `getCanonicalPath()` method is used to get the canonical path of the file, but the canonical path is not validated. An attacker could potentially manipulate the input path to traverse the file system and access sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input path to ensure it is within the intended directory. This can be done by using a whitelist approach, where only specific directories are allowed. Alternatively, the code can use a library like Apache Commons IO to validate the path. Additionally, the code should consider using a more secure method to get the file path, such as using a `Path` object from the `java.nio.file` package. 

Note: The code snippet is vulnerable because it uses `getCanonicalPath()` to get the canonical path of the file, but does not validate the path. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input path to traverse the file system and access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. 

The `startsWith()` method is used to check if the
