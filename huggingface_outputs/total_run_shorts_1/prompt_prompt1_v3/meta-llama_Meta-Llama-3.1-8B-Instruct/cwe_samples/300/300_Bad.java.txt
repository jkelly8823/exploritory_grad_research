VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack due to the use of a Socket object to connect to a remote host without proper validation of the remote host's identity.
EXPLANATION: The code creates a Socket object to connect to a remote host at a specified IP address and port. However, it does not perform any validation of the remote host's identity, making it susceptible to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker could intercept the connection and inject malicious code, potentially leading to RCE.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the remote host's identity before establishing the connection. This can be done by verifying the remote host's IP address or using a secure authentication mechanism such as SSL/TLS. Additionally, the code should handle any exceptions that may occur during the connection attempt to prevent unexpected behavior. For example, the code could use a try-catch block to catch any SocketException that may be thrown. 

Note: The code snippet is incomplete, but based on the provided information, the vulnerability can be identified.
