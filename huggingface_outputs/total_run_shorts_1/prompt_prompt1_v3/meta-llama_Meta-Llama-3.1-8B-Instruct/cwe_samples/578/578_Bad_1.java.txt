VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a Java deserialization vulnerability. The CustomClassLoader is used to load a class from a potentially untrusted source, and the class is instantiated without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The CustomClassLoader is used to load a class from a string, which is a common attack vector for Java deserialization vulnerabilities. The class is loaded without any validation or sanitization, which means that an attacker can inject malicious code. The instantiation of the class without validation or sanitization also allows an attacker to inject malicious code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain remote code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the CustomClassLoader should be removed and the class should be loaded using the standard ClassLoader. Additionally, the class should be instantiated using a secure method, such as using a constructor that takes a validated and sanitized object as a parameter. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that any sensitive data is properly validated and sanitized before being used. Finally, consider using a Java serialization framework
