VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a deadlock situation due to the use of synchronized methods for deposit and withdrawal operations. This can occur when two threads attempt to deposit and withdraw money simultaneously, resulting in a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: 
The synchronized methods in the BankAccount class can lead to a deadlock situation when multiple threads are accessing the account simultaneously. This is because the deposit and withdrawal operations are synchronized, which means that only one thread can execute these operations at a time. If two threads attempt to deposit and withdraw money at the same time, they will block each other, resulting in a deadlock. This can cause the program to freeze or crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a lock object that is shared among all threads, or use a more advanced concurrency control mechanism such as ReentrantLock or Semaphore. Additionally, consider using a transactional approach to ensure that either both deposit and withdrawal operations are successful or neither is, to prevent partial updates.
