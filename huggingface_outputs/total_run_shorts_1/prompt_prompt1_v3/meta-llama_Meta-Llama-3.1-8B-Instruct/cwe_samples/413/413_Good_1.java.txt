VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a deadlock situation. This is because the withdraw method is waiting for the deposit method to signal the sufficientFundsCondition, but the deposit method is waiting for the withdraw method to release the lock. This creates a cycle of waiting, which can lead to a deadlock.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the withdraw method is waiting for the sufficientFundsCondition to be signaled, but the deposit method is holding the lock and waiting for the withdraw method to release it. This creates a cycle of waiting, which can lead to a deadlock. This is a classic example of a deadlock situation, where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the deposit method should not hold the lock while signaling the sufficientFundsCondition. Instead, it should release the lock before signaling the condition. This will allow the withdraw method to continue executing and release the lock, breaking the cycle of waiting. The withdraw method should also be modified to release the lock before waiting for the sufficientFundsCondition. This will prevent the deadlock situation from
