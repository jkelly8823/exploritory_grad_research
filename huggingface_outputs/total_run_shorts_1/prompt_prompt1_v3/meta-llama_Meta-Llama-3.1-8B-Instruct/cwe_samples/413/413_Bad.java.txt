VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential division by zero error when the withdrawAmount is equal to the accountBalance. This is because the withdraw method does not check if the withdrawAmount is greater than the accountBalance before attempting to subtract it.
EXPLANATION: The withdraw method does not include any checks to prevent a division by zero error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes when the withdrawAmount is equal to the accountBalance. The deposit method also does not include any checks, but it does not pose the same risk as the withdraw method.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the withdraw method should be modified to check if the withdrawAmount is greater than the accountBalance before attempting to subtract it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check for this condition. The deposit method should also be modified to check if the depositAmount is negative, as this could also lead to unexpected behavior. Here is an example of how the modified methods could look: 

public void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {
    if (withdrawAmount > accountBalance) {
        throw new InsufficientFundsException();
    }
    double new
