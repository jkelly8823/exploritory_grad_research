VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A memory leak is present due to the function returning a pointer to a local variable, which is a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block. This memory block is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.
EXPLANATION: The function `trimTrailingWhitespace` dynamically allocates memory for the string `message` using `malloc`. However, it then returns a pointer to a local variable `retMessage`, which is a pointer to the same dynamically allocated memory block. This is problematic because the memory block is not freed, resulting in a memory leak. This is a classic example of a dangling pointer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should return the dynamically allocated memory block directly, without returning a pointer to a local variable. This can be achieved by changing the return statement to `return message;`. Additionally, the function should be modified to free the dynamically allocated memory block when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. This can be achieved by adding a call to `free` before the function returns. For example: `free(message); return message;`. However, since the function is returning the dynamically allocated memory
