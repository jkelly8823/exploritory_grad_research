VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `manipulate_string` uses a buffer `buf` of fixed size 24, but it does not check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the input string is longer than 23 characters.
EXPLANATION: The `strcpy` function will copy the input string into the buffer without stopping at a null character, so if the input string is longer than the buffer, it will overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should check the length of the input string before copying it into the buffer. This can be done using the `strlen` function. The function should also be modified to handle the case where the input string is longer than the buffer. One possible solution is to use a dynamically allocated buffer or to use a safer string copying function like `strncpy`. Additionally, consider using a safer string function like `snprintf` to avoid buffer overflows. ```c
void manipulate_string(char * string) {
    char buf[24];
