VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of error handling in the accept() function. If the accept() function fails, it will return -1, but the code does not check for this and will continue to execute, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected behavior.
EXPLANATION: The accept() function can fail for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, the queue for the socket is full, the socket is not listening, or the peer is not accepting connections. If the accept() function fails, it will return -1, but the code does not check for this and will continue to execute, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected behavior. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to check the return value of the accept() function and handle any errors that may occur. This can be done by checking if the return value is -1 and if so, printing an error message and exiting the loop. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the fork() function fails, as this can
