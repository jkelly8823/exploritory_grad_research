VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential HTTP Request Body Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code does not properly handle the case where the request body exceeds the maximum allowed size. If the request body is larger than MaxRespBodyLength, the io.ReadAll function will read the entire request body into memory, potentially causing a buffer overflow. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or even arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a streaming approach to read the request body, such as using a bufio.Reader or a goroutine to read the body in chunks. This will prevent the entire request body from being read into memory at once, mitigating the risk of a buffer overflow. Additionally, consider implementing a more robust error handling mechanism to handle cases where the request body exceeds the maximum allowed size. For example, you could return a 413 Payload Too Large error to the client. 

Note: The code is vulnerable because it does not handle the case where the request body exceeds the maximum allowed size. The io.ReadAll function will read the entire request body into memory, potentially causing a buffer overflow. This could lead to a
