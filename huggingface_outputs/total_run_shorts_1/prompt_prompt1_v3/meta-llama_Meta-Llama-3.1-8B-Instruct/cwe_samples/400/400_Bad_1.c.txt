VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the lack of bounds checking on the filename and buffer variables.
EXPLANATION: The code uses fixed-size character arrays to store the filename and buffer. However, the `getNextMessage` function does not guarantee that the received data will not exceed the size of these arrays. If the received data is larger than the array size, it will overflow the array, potentially leading to a buffer overflow attack. This can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use dynamically allocated memory for the filename and buffer variables, and check the length of the received data before copying it to these variables. Alternatively, the `getNextMessage` function should be modified to ensure that it does not send more data than the array size can hold. Additionally, the code should use a safer function to write to the file, such as `fopen` and `fwrite`, to avoid potential buffer overflows.
