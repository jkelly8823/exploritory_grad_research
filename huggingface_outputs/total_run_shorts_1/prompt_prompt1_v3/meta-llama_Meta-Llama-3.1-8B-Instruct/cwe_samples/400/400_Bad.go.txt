VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a limit on the size of the request body. This allows an attacker to send a large request body, causing the server to consume excessive memory and potentially leading to a crash.
EXPLANATION: The code reads the entire request body into memory using `io.ReadAll(r.Body)`, which can lead to a denial-of-service attack if the request body is large. This is because the server will consume excessive memory to store the large request body, potentially leading to a crash. To mitigate this, a limit should be placed on the size of the request body.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `http.MaxBytesReader` function to limit the size of the request body. For example: `r.Body = http.MaxBytesReader(r.Context(), r.Body, 1024*1024)`. This will limit the request body to 1MB. You can adjust the limit to a value that suits your needs. Additionally, consider using a streaming approach to read the request body, such as using a `bufio.Reader` to
