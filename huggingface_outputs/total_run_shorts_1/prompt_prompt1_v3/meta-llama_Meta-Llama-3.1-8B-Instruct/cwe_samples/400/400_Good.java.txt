VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a resource leak due to the creation of a new thread for each incoming connection without properly closing it. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
EXPLANATION: The code creates a new thread for each incoming connection using the ExecutorService. However, the ExecutorService is created within the loop and is not properly shut down after use. This can lead to a resource leak as the threads are not properly closed, and the ExecutorService is not shut down. This can cause the program to consume increasing amounts of memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the ExecutorService should be created outside the loop and shut down after use. Additionally, the threads should be properly closed after use. This can be achieved by using a ThreadPoolExecutor and calling its shutdown() method after use. The code should also be modified to handle the case where the ExecutorService is not shut down properly. This can be achieved by using a try-finally block to ensure that the ExecutorService is shut down even if an exception is thrown. Here
