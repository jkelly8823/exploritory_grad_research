VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the processMessage function. The function does not properly validate the length of the message body, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The processMessage function takes a two-dimensional character array as input, where the first element of the array contains the length of the message and the second element contains the message body. However, the function does not check if the length of the message body is within a valid range before accessing it. This allows an attacker to pass a message with a length that is larger than the allocated buffer, causing a buffer overflow. The attacker can then potentially execute arbitrary code by overwriting the return address on the stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should validate the length of the message body before accessing it. This can be done by checking if the length is within a valid range and returning an error if it is not. Additionally, the function should use a safer method to access the message body, such as using a pointer to the first character of the message body instead of accessing it directly. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that all possible
