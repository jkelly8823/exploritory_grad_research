VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input from the $_COOKIE["mid"] variable into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the value of the "mid" cookie.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the user input from the SQL code. For example, you can use the mysqli or PDO extension to prepare the query and bind the user input as a parameter. Additionally, consider validating and sanitizing the user input to prevent any malicious characters from being injected. Here is an example of how to use prepared statements with mysqli: $stmt = mysqli_prepare($link, "SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID =?"); mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "i", $id); mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt); mysqli_stmt_store_result($stmt); mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt); mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);. 

Note: The code is using the deprecated mysql_query function, which is not recommended for use in new code. It is recommended to use
