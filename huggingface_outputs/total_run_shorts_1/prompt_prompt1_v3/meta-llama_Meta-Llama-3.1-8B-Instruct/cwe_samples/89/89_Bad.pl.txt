VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The `allowList` function may prevent some malicious input, but it is not a reliable method for preventing SQL injection. The `getUserInput` function is not shown, but it is likely that it can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use PDO or MySQLi to prepare the SQL query and bind the user input as a parameter. This will ensure that the user input is treated as a literal value and cannot be executed as SQL code. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input, but this should be done in conjunction with prepared statements. The `allowList` function should be reviewed and updated to ensure it is not allowing any malicious characters. The `getUserInput` function should be reviewed to ensure it is not vulnerable to injection. 

Note: The `allowList` function is not a reliable method
