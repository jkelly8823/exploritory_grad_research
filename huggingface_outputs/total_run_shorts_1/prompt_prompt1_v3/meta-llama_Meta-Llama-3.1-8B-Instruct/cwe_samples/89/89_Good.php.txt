VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input from the $_COOKIE["mid"] variable into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the value of the "mid" cookie.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use the following code: $id = intval($_COOKIE["mid"]); $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID =?"); $stmt->bind_param("i", $id); $stmt->execute(); $result = $stmt->get_result(); while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) { // process the result } $stmt->close(); This code uses a prepared statement with a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection. Alternatively, you can use a library like PDO to achieve the same result. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve user IDs, such as using a session or a secure token.
