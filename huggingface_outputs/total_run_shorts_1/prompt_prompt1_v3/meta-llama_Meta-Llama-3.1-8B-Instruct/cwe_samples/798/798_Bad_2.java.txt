VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a hardcoded password vulnerability. The password "68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b" is hardcoded directly into the code, which is a security risk. This allows unauthorized access to the system if the password is compromised.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a hardcoded password for verification. This is a security risk because if the password is compromised, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system. Hardcoded passwords should be avoided and instead, passwords should be stored securely, such as in a database or using a secure password storage mechanism.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded password should be removed and replaced with a secure password storage mechanism. This can be achieved by storing the password in a database or using a secure password storage library. Additionally, the password verification should be done using a secure method, such as hashing and salting the password. The code should be refactored to use a more secure approach to password verification.  The password should be hashed and stored securely, and then compared to the hashed input password. This will prevent unauthorized access to the system
