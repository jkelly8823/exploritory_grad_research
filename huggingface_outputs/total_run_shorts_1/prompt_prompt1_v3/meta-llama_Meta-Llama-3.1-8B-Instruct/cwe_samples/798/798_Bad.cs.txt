VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet contains a hardcoded password vulnerability. The password "68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b" is hardcoded in the VerifyAdmin function, which is a security risk. This allows unauthorized access to the system if the password is compromised.
EXPLANATION: The VerifyAdmin function is designed to verify an administrator's password. However, instead of securely storing and comparing the password, it uses a hardcoded value. This means that if the password is discovered, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system. Hardcoded passwords are a common security risk and should be avoided.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the password should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secure storage mechanism. The VerifyAdmin function should be modified to compare the input password with the stored password, rather than using a hardcoded value. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as password hashing and salting, to further protect the system.  The function should also be modified to handle cases where the password is not provided, or is empty, to prevent potential errors.  Consider using a more secure
