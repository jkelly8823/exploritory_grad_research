VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability to a buffer overflow attack exists due to the use of a string literal in a variable that is later used in a printf statement.
EXPLANATION: The variable test_string is assigned a string literal "Hello World!" which is a string of length 12. However, the printf statement will print the entire contents of test_string, which can be any string of length up to the maximum buffer size. If the buffer size is small, this can lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a dynamically allocated buffer with a size that is sufficient to hold the largest possible string. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a safer function like snprintf to prevent buffer overflows. The code should also be modified to check the length of the string before printing it to prevent buffer overflows.  The variable test_string should be declared as a pointer to a character array with a sufficient size to hold the largest possible string. For example: char test_string[256];. The printf statement should be modified to use the safer function snprintf to prevent buffer
