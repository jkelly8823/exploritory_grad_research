VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation on the $state variable.
EXPLANATION: The ExtractUserID function is called with the $state variable as an argument, but there is no validation to ensure that $state contains a valid and safe value. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Validate the $state variable before passing it to the ExtractUserID function. This can be done by checking if $state is a string and if it matches a specific format. Additionally, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example: if (is_string($state) && preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/', $state)) { $uid = ExtractUserID($state); } else { // handle invalid input }
