VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check the return value of the malloc function before using the allocated memory. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the allocation fails.
EXPLANATION: The malloc function returns a null pointer if it fails to allocate memory. However, the code does not check for this condition before using the allocated memory. This can lead to a null pointer dereference, which can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of the malloc function before using the allocated memory. This can be done by checking if the return value is null before using it. If the allocation fails, the code should handle the error accordingly. For example, it can print an error message and exit the program. Here is an example of how the code can be modified to check the return value of malloc: ```c
tmp = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);
if (tmp == NULL) {
    perror("Failure");
    exit(1);
}
```
