VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a type juggling vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the variable $i is a numeric variable, while the variable $s1 is a string variable. When the code compares the two variables using the == operator, PHP will attempt to convert the numeric variable to a string, and the string variable to a numeric value. If the string variable can be converted to a numeric value, then the comparison will be done numerically. If the string variable cannot be converted to a numeric value, then the comparison will be done lexicographically.
EXPLANATION: This type of vulnerability is often used in attacks to trick developers into comparing a numeric variable to a string variable that contains a numeric value. For example, an attacker could pass a string variable that contains a numeric value to a function that expects a numeric variable, and then use the == operator to compare the string variable to a numeric variable. If the string variable can be converted to a numeric value, then the comparison will be done numerically, and the attacker may be able to trick the developer into thinking that the string variable is equal to the numeric variable.
