VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a type confusion vulnerability due to the use of the String constructor to create a string object, which can be exploited to bypass type checks and potentially lead to code execution.
EXPLANATION: The code creates a string object using the String constructor, which can be exploited to bypass type checks. This is because the String constructor can create a string object that is not the same as the primitive string value. In this case, the string object created by the String constructor is compared to the primitive string value using the === operator, which can lead to a type confusion vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited to bypass type checks and potentially lead to code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the primitive string value directly instead of creating a string object using the String constructor. For example, instead of using var s4 = new String('65');, use var s4 = '65';. This will ensure that the comparison between s4 and i is done using the primitive string value, which will prevent the type confusion vulnerability. Additionally, it is recommended to use the strict equality operator (===) instead
