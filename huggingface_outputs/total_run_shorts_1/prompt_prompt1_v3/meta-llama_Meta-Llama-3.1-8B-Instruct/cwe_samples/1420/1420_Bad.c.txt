VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to a potential out-of-bounds array access.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The variable 'y' is assigned a value from an array 'array2' using an index that is calculated by multiplying 'array1[x]' by 4096. However, there is no check to ensure that this index is within the bounds of the 'array2' array. If 'array1[x]' is greater than or equal to the size of 'array2' divided by 4096, this will result in an out-of-bounds access, leading to a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, add a bounds check to ensure that the calculated index is within the valid range of the 'array2' array. This can be done by checking if the index is less than the size of 'array2' before accessing the array. Additionally, consider using a safer indexing approach, such as using the modulo operator to ensure the index is within the valid range. For example: if (x < array1_size && array1[x] * 4096 < array2_size)
