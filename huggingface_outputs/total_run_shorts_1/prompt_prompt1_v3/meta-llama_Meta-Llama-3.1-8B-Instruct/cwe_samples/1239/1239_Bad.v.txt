VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to an "insecure reset" vulnerability. This is because the reset logic is not properly synchronized with the clock, allowing the reset signal to be asserted concurrently with the clock edge, potentially causing the state machine to enter an inconsistent state.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the line `always @(posedge clk_i) if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))`. The `rst_ni` and `rst_3` signals are not properly synchronized with the clock, allowing the reset logic to be asserted concurrently with the clock edge. This can cause the state machine to enter an inconsistent state, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the reset logic should be properly synchronized with the clock using a non-blocking assignment. For example, the line `if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))` should be replaced with `if(~rst_ni && ~rst_3)`. Additionally, the reset signals should be properly synchronized with the clock using a non-blocking assignment. For example, the lines `startHash <= 0; newMessage <= 0;
