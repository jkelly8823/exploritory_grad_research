VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `File` constructor does not perform any validation on the input path, allowing an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The `File` constructor in Java does not perform any validation on the input path. This means that if an attacker can manipulate the `downloadedFilePath` variable, they can potentially access arbitrary files on the system. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack, where an attacker can navigate the file system by manipulating the path.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a `Path` object from the `java.nio.file` package, which provides a more secure way to work with file paths. You can use the `Paths.get()` method to create a `Path` object from the input path, and then use the `toAbsolutePath()` method to ensure that the path is absolute. Additionally, you can use the `resolve()` method to normalize the path and prevent path traversal attacks. For example: `Path path = Paths.get(downloadedFilePath).toAbsolutePath().normalize();` You should then use this `
