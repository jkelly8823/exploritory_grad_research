VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability due to the use of a potentially long regular expression pattern.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression pattern `^\w[\w\-]+$` can be exploited to cause a denial of service attack by providing a very long string that matches the pattern, leading to excessive CPU usage and potential crashes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more efficient regular expression pattern or a safer alternative such as `\w+` which matches one or more word characters. Additionally, consider using the `^` and `$` anchors to prevent the regular expression from matching too much of the input string. If the regular expression is intended to match a specific format, consider using a more specific pattern that cannot be exploited for ReDoS attacks.  Also, consider using a library that can handle regular expressions in a safe way, such as PCRE.  Finally, consider adding input validation to prevent malicious input from reaching the regular expression.  This can be done by checking the length of the input string and rejecting it if it is too long.  This can prevent the ReDoS attack from occurring in the
