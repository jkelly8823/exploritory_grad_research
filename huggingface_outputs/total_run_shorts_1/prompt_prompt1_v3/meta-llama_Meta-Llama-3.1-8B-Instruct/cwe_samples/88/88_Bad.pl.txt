VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the filename argument.
EXPLANATION: The system function is used to execute a command. However, the command is constructed by concatenating the filename argument directly into the command string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the filename argument. For example, if the filename argument is set to "; ls -l /etc/passwd", the command would be executed as "/bin/ls -l /etc/passwd; ls -l /etc/passwd", which would list the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the command should be constructed using a safe method, such as using the qx operator or a library function that takes a filename as an argument. For example, the qx operator can be used to execute the ls command as follows: qx(ls -l $fname). This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious commands by manipulating the filename argument. Alternatively, the File::Spec module can be used to construct the command in a safe way. For example: my $cmd = File
