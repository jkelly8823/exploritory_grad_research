VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition exists between the bootrom and Linux read data access.
EXPLANATION: The bootrom and Linux read data access share the same request and address lines. This creates a scenario where the bootrom and Linux could be accessing the ROM simultaneously, leading to a potential race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Ensure that the bootrom and Linux read data access do not share the same request and address lines. This can be achieved by adding a separate request and address line for the Linux bootrom. For example, add a new input port to the i_bootrom_linux module for the Linux request line, and connect it to a separate request line. Similarly, add a new input port for the Linux address line and connect it to a separate address line. This will prevent the bootrom and Linux from accessing the ROM simultaneously, eliminating the potential race condition.  Additionally, consider adding a synchronization mechanism, such as a mutex or a semaphore, to ensure that only one module is accessing the ROM at a time.  Also, consider adding a check to ensure that the bootrom and Linux are not accessing the ROM simultaneously. This can be achieved by adding
