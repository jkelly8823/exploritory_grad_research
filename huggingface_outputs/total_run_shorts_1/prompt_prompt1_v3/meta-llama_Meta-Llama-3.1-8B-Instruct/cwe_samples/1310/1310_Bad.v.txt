 


VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition because the bootrom and linux rom data is being assigned to rom_rdata in a way that can be affected by the value of ariane_boot_sel_i, which is not properly synchronized with the bootrom and linux rom data access.
EXPLANATION: The line "assign rom_rdata = (ariane_boot_sel_i) ? rom_rdata_linux : rom_rdata_linux;" is the source of the vulnerability. This line is attempting to select between two different values of rom_rdata based on the value of ariane_boot_sel_i. However, the values of rom_rdata_linux are being accessed concurrently by the bootrom and linux rom data access, which can result in a race condition. This is because the bootrom and linux rom data access are not properly synchronized, and the value of ariane_boot_sel_i is not guaranteed to be stable when the assignment to rom_rdata is made.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the bootrom and linux rom data access should be properly synchronized using a mutex or other synchronization primitive. Additionally, the value of ariane_boot_sel_i should be guaranteed to
