VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` can cause a denial of service attack if the input string is very long and contains a large number of consecutive backslashes. This is because the regular expression engine will take a long time to process the input string, leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you can use a more efficient regular expression that uses possessive quantifiers or atomic grouping to prevent catastrophic backtracking. For example, you can use the following regular expression: `^\w[^\W_]+`. This regular expression uses a negative lookahead to match any character that is not a word character or an underscore, which prevents the regular expression engine from backtracking and reduces the risk of a denial of service attack. Alternatively, you can use a more robust regular expression library that is designed to handle large input strings and prevent denial of service attacks.  ```php
$name = preg_match('/^\w[^\W_]+/', $name);
```  ```javascript
const regex = /^[\w-]+$/;
