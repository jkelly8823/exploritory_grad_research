VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string formatting to construct a prompt for the chatbot.
EXPLANATION: The use of string formatting to construct the prompt allows an attacker to inject malicious input, potentially leading to a SQL injection attack. This is because the `arg1` and `arg2` variables are not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a parameterized query or a library that supports parameterized queries, such as `sqlite3` or `psycopg2`. Alternatively, the code can use a library that supports safe string formatting, such as `str.format()` with a `safe` parameter. The `arg1` and `arg2` variables should also be validated and sanitized to prevent malicious input. For example: `prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(sanitize_input(arg1), sanitize_input(arg2))`. The `sanitize_input()` function should be implemented to remove any malicious characters from the input. 

Note: The `invokeChatbot()` function is not shown in the code
