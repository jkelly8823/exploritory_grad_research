VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: CWE-113: Incorrect Dependence on the Presence of Data Value (aka "Missing Initialization") - The code does not check if the regular expression matches before attempting to use the matched groups. This can lead to a potential exception if the regular expression does not match.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression is used to search for a pattern in the input strings `arg1` and `arg2`. However, the code does not check if the regular expression matches before attempting to use the matched groups. This can lead to a potential exception if the regular expression does not match. The code should check if the regular expression matches before attempting to use the matched groups.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to ensure that the regular expression matches before attempting to use the matched groups. This can be done by checking if `match1` and `match2` are not `None` before attempting to use them. For example: `if match1 is not None and match2 is not None:...`. Additionally, consider using a more robust way to handle the case where the regular expression does not match, such as raising a custom exception or returning an error message.
