VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the use of user-controlled input in the include() function without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the include() function to include a PHP file based on user-controlled input from the $_GET['lang'] variable. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code by manipulating the 'lang' parameter in the URL. The preg_match() function is used to validate the input, but it only checks if the input matches the pattern of alphanumeric characters, which is not sufficient to prevent code injection attacks. An attacker can bypass this validation by using a URL like http://example.com?lang=../../../../etc/passwd, which would include the /etc/passwd file and potentially reveal sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a whitelist approach to validate the input, checking against a list of allowed languages instead of relying on a regular expression. Additionally, the include() function should be replaced with a more secure alternative, such as require_once() or a custom function that checks the file existence and permissions before including it. The code should also be updated
