VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a shell injection attack because it directly executes the output of the subprocess call without sanitizing it.
EXPLANATION: The subprocess call in the run_ping_regex function directly executes the output of the ping command. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the IP address. For example, if an attacker passes an IP address like "192.168.1.1; rm -rf /", the subprocess call would execute the rm -rf command, leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use the subprocess.check_output function instead of subprocess.call, and then parse the output to extract the relevant information. This would prevent the execution of malicious commands. Additionally, the code should validate the IP address more thoroughly to prevent attacks like this. The validate_ip_regex function should be modified to prevent IP addresses with special characters. For example, it could use a more restrictive regular expression like r"^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(25[0-5]|2
