VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code due to the assignment of a 512-bit value to a 32-bit register.
EXPLANATION: The line `pass_data = { {60{8'h00}}, data_d};` assigns a 512-bit value to `pass_data`, which is a 32-bit register. This can potentially cause a buffer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior or even a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the width of the `pass_data` register should be increased to at least 512 bits to match the width of the assigned value. Alternatively, a masking operation can be used to ensure that only the relevant bits are assigned to `pass_data`. Additionally, it is recommended to use a safer assignment method, such as concatenation with a width specifier, to avoid potential buffer overflow issues.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where `pass_mode` is not set, potentially leading to an unexpected state transition.
