VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double close of a file pointer
EXPLANATION: The file pointer 'f' is closed twice. This can lead to undefined behavior. The first fclose() call is unnecessary and should be removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Remove the second fclose() call. The corrected code should only close the file pointer once. The fclose() call should be moved before the second if condition. Here is the corrected code: if (f_flg) { int r1 = fclose(f); f_flg = 0; printf("\n-----------------\n1 close done '%d'\n", r1); } if (f_flg) { f_flg = 0; printf("2 close done\n"); } else { fclose(f); printf("2 close done '%d'\n", fclose(f)); }  . 

Note: This is a contrived example. In real-world code, the file pointer 'f' should be closed in a finally block or using a RAII idiom to ensure that it is always closed.  . 

I have evaluated the code snippet and provided the required response. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
