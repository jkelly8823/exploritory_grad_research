VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to an incorrect calculation of the size of memory to be allocated for the id_sequence array. The size of the array is not checked after the allocation, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet allocates memory for an array of three integers, but it does not check if the allocation was successful. However, the real issue here is that the size of the array is not checked after the allocation. This makes it vulnerable to buffer overflows, as the size of the array can be modified after the allocation, potentially causing it to overflow and write to adjacent memory locations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Always check the return value of malloc to ensure that the allocation was successful.
2. Use a fixed-size array instead of dynamically allocating memory to avoid buffer overflows.
3. If dynamic memory allocation is necessary, use a safer alternative like std::vector or a similar container that automatically handles memory management and checks for buffer overflows. 
4. Always check the size of the array after allocation to prevent buffer overflows.
