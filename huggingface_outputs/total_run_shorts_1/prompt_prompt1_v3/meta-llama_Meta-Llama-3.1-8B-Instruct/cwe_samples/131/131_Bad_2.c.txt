VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `dst_buf` is allocated with a fixed size based on `MAX_SIZE`, but the size of the input string is not checked before copying it to the buffer. If the input string is longer than `MAX_SIZE`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `dst_buf` is allocated with a fixed size, but the size of the input string is not checked before copying it to the buffer. If the input string is longer than `MAX_SIZE`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The `die` function is called if the input string is too long, but this is not a sufficient defense against a buffer overflow attack, as an attacker can still cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input string before copying it to the buffer, and allocate the buffer dynamically based on the length of the input string. Alternatively, the code can use a safer function
