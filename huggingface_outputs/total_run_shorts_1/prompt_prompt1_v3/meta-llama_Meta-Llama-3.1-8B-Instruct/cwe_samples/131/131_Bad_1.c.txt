VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `malloc` call allocates memory for an array of `num_imgs` `img_t` structures, but the size of each `img_t` structure is not known, making it difficult to determine the total size of memory allocated. If `num_imgs` is large, this could result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the size of each `img_t` structure is not specified. This makes it challenging to accurately calculate the total size of memory required for the array. If the size of each `img_t` structure is large, the `malloc` call may not allocate sufficient memory, leading to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the size of each `img_t` structure should be specified. This can be done by including the size of the structure in the `malloc` call, like this: `table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(num_imgs * sizeof(img_t));`.
