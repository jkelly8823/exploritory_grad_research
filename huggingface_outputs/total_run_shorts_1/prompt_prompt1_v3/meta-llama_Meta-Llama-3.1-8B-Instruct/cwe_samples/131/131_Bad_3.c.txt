VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (malloc) without checking the actual size of the memory allocation. This can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to allocate memory for a dynamic array of PacketHeader structures. However, the size of the allocation is fixed at numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader), without considering the possibility that numHeaders could be larger than the actual available memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow, where more data is written to the allocated memory than it can hold, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The recommended fix is to use a dynamic memory allocation function, such as realloc, that takes into account the actual size of the memory allocation. Alternatively, use a data structure that is designed to handle dynamic arrays, such as a vector or an array list. Additionally, it is recommended to check the return value of malloc to ensure that the allocation was successful. For example: headers = realloc(headers, numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader)); if (headers == NULL) { ExitError("Memory allocation failed"); }
