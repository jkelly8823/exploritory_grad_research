VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to an Azure Storage Account public blob access vulnerability. Allowing public blob access can expose sensitive data to unauthorized access.
EXPLANATION: The az storage account update command is being used to update the storage account to allow public blob access. This can be a security risk if not properly configured, as it allows anyone to access the blobs in the storage account without authentication. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, do not use the --allow-blob-public-access true flag when updating the storage account. Instead, use the --allow-blob-public-access false flag to disable public blob access. Additionally, consider implementing Azure Storage Account access controls, such as Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, to restrict access to the storage account. This will help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.  Also, ensure that the storage account is properly configured with network security groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall to restrict incoming traffic.  Finally, regularly review and update the storage account's access controls to ensure they remain secure.  Consider using Azure Storage Account's built-in features such as Azure Storage Analytics and
