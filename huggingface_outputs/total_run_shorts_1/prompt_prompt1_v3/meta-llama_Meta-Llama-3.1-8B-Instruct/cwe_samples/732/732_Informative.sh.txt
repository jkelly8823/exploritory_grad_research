VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to an IAM policy bypass due to the use of gsutil iam get command with a hardcoded bucket name. This allows an attacker to access the IAM policy of the bucket without proper authentication.
EXPLANATION: The gsutil iam get command is used to retrieve the IAM policy of a bucket. However, in this code snippet, the bucket name is hardcoded as 'gs://BUCKET_NAME'. This means that anyone with access to this code can access the IAM policy of the bucket without needing to authenticate. This is a security risk as it allows an attacker to access sensitive information about the bucket's IAM policy.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the bucket name should be retrieved dynamically using the Google Cloud Client Library or by using environment variables. This will ensure that the bucket name is not hardcoded and can be securely accessed. Additionally, proper authentication and authorization should be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access the IAM policy of the bucket.  The code should be modified to use the following pattern: `gsutil iam get gs://$(BUCKET_NAME)` or `gsutil iam get gs://$(echo $BUCKET_NAME)
