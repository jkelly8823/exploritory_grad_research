VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition when creating the admin file and changing its mode. This is because the file creation and mode change operations are not atomic, and another process could potentially access the file before its mode is changed, leading to unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The `createAdminFileIfNotExists` function creates the admin file if it does not exist, but it does not ensure that the file is not accessed by another process before its mode is changed. The `changeModeOfAdminFile` function changes the mode of the admin file, but it does not check if the file exists before attempting to change its mode. This can lead to a race condition, where another process accesses the file before its mode is changed, potentially leading to unintended behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the file creation and mode change operations are atomic. This can be achieved by using a lock or a transaction to ensure that the file is not accessed by another process while its mode is being changed. Alternatively, the code can use a file system that supports atomic file operations, such as a distributed file system.
