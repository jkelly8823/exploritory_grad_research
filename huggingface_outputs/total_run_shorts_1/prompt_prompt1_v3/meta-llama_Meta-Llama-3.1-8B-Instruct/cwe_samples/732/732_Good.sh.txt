 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a command-line invocation of the Azure CLI, specifically updating a storage account to disallow public access to blobs. The command is parameterized with placeholders for the storage account name and resource group, but these placeholders are not evaluated as code. The command itself does not contain any syntax errors or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet is secure as written. However, it is recommended to ensure that the placeholders for the storage account name and resource group are replaced with actual values to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information. Additionally, consider using environment variables or a secrets management system to store and retrieve sensitive values.  ```bash
az storage account update --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --allow-blob-public-access false
```  or  ```bash
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT=<storage-account>
export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group>
az storage account update --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --allow-blob-public-access false
```  ```bash
```  ```bash
```  ```bash
