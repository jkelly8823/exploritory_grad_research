VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a fallthrough vulnerability in the switch statement. This occurs when the switch statement does not properly handle the case where the input value does not match any of the specified cases. In this case, the code will print the message for the last case (December) regardless of the input month.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement in the code is not properly formatted. The fallthrough vulnerability occurs because the code does not include a break statement after each case. This allows the code to continue executing and print the message for the last case, even if the input month does not match any of the specified cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be reformatted to include a break statement after each case. This will ensure that the code properly handles the case where the input value does not match any of the specified cases. The corrected code should look like this: case 1: print("January"); break; case 2: print("February"); break;.... This will prevent the fallthrough vulnerability and ensure that the code prints the correct message for the input month.  Additionally, the code can be simplified by
