VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability in the AuthenticateUser function.
EXPLANATION: The AuthenticateUser function is called with user input ($_POST['user'] and $_POST['password']) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use PDO or MySQLi with prepared statements. Additionally, consider using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection. Always validate and sanitize user input before passing it to database queries. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the definition of the AuthenticateUser function, but based on the context, it is likely that it is a database query that is vulnerable to SQL injection.
