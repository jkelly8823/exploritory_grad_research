VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A potential SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input validation on the file name parameter.
EXPLANATION: The processFile method takes a string parameter fName, which is used to create a FileReader object. However, the file name is not validated or sanitized, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks or other types of injection. An attacker could potentially manipulate the file name to access sensitive files or execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, validate and sanitize the file name parameter using a whitelist approach or regular expressions. For example, you can use the Path.GetFullPath method to ensure the file path is absolute and within a specific directory. Additionally, consider using a library like Apache Commons IO to handle file operations securely. ```csharp
                private void processFile(string fName){if (!Path.IsPathRooted(fName)){fName = Path.GetFullPath(fName);}if (!Path.GetDirectoryName(fName).Equals(Path.GetDirectoryName("allowed_directory"))){throw new ArgumentException("Invalid file path");}BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine())!= null){processLine(line);}}
