 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function decodeFile() does not check for buffer overflow when reading from the file. This can lead to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability if the file contains a line longer than BUF_SZ characters.
EXPLANATION: The fgets() function reads at most BUF_SZ - 1 characters from the file and stores them in the buffer. However, it does not check if the line is longer than BUF_SZ characters. If the line is longer, it will be truncated and the remaining characters will be left in the input buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow when the next fgets() call is made.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should check the length of the line read from the file and ensure it does not exceed BUF_SZ characters. This can be done by using the strlen() function to get the length of the line and checking if it is less than or equal to BUF_SZ. If it is not, the function should return an error or handle the situation accordingly. Alternatively, the buffer size can be increased to accommodate longer lines. However, this may not be feasible or desirable in all cases. The function should also be modified to handle the case
