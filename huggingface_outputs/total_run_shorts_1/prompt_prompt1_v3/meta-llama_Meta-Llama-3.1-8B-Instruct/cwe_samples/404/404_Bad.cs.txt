VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly concatenates user input (queryString) into the SQL command without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries by replacing the queryString with a parameter and then adding the parameter to the SqlCommand. For example: SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = @param", conn); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@param", queryString); This approach ensures that user input is treated as a parameter rather than part of the SQL command, preventing SQL injection attacks. Additionally, consider using a using statement to ensure the connection is properly closed and disposed of, even if an exception is thrown. For example: using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString)) {... } This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures the connection is closed when it is no longer needed.
