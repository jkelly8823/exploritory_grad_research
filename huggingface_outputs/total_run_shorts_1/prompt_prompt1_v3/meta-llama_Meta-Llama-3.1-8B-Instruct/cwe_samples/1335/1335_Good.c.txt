VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function `choose_bit` does not check if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is a boolean value. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is not a boolean value, because the condition `if (NEED_TO_SHIFT)` may not behave as expected.
EXPLANATION: The function `choose_bit` uses the condition `if (NEED_TO_SHIFT)`, but it does not check if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is a boolean value. In C, non-zero values are considered true in a boolean context, so if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is a non-zero integer, the condition will be true. However, if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is a non-integer value, the behavior of the condition is undefined. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is not a boolean value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function `choose_bit` should be modified to check if `NEED_TO_SHIFT` is a boolean value before using it in the condition. This can be done by adding a check, for example: `if ((NEED_TO_SHIFT) && (NEED_TO_SHIFT
