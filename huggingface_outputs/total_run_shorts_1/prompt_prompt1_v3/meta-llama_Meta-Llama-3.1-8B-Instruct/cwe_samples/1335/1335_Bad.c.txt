VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A signed integer overflow occurs when shifting a signed integer by a negative value. This can lead to undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to shift the value 1 to the left by -5 positions. However, when a signed integer is shifted by a negative value, the result is undefined and can cause an integer overflow. In this case, the shift operation can cause the value of r to be larger than the maximum value that can be represented by an unsigned int, leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the shift value is non-negative. If a negative shift is necessary, consider using an unsigned integer type to avoid the possibility of overflow. Alternatively, use a library function that handles the shift operation correctly. Additionally, consider using a safer integer type, such as int64_t, to reduce the risk of overflow.  ```c
int64_t r = (int64_t)1 << -5;
```  would be a safer alternative.```c
