VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is because the query string is constructed by concatenating user input (username and accountNumber) directly into the SQL query. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input values, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a parameterized query or prepared statement to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can be achieved by using a PreparedStatement object, which allows for the safe execution of SQL queries with user-supplied input. For example, you can modify the query string to use placeholders for the user input, and then set the input values using the PreparedStatement's set methods. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Here is an example of how to modify the code to use a parameterized query: ```java public BankAccount getUserBankAccount(String username, String accountNumber) { BankAccount userAccount = null; try { if (isAuthorizedUser(username)) { String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner =? AND accountID =?"; DatabaseManager dbManager = new
