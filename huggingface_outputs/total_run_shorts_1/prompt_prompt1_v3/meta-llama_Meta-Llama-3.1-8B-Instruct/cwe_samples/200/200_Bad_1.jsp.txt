VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The Boolean.getBoolean() method is used to retrieve a system property, which can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious URLs.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the Boolean.getBoolean() method to retrieve a system property named "debugEnabled". However, this method can be used to inject malicious URLs, which can lead to SSRF attacks. An attacker can manipulate the "debugEnabled" property to point to a malicious URL, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a secure method to retrieve the "debugEnabled" property, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that any URLs used in the code are properly sanitized and validated to prevent SSRF attacks. The code should also be updated to use a more secure method to display sensitive information, such as using a secure logging mechanism. 

Note: The code snippet is using JSP (JavaServer Pages) syntax, which is an older technology and not recommended for
