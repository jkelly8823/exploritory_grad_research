 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to information disclosure. It directly displays sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers and Credit Card Numbers on the webpage, potentially exposing users to identity theft and financial fraud.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the ERb templating engine to directly output sensitive information. This is a security risk because it allows an attacker to easily obtain sensitive information about users. In a real-world application, sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers and Credit Card Numbers should be stored securely and only displayed in a masked or redacted format to prevent unauthorized access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to store sensitive information securely and only display a masked or redacted version of the information. This can be achieved by using a library or framework that provides secure storage and masking of sensitive information. For example, you can use a library like `mask` to mask the sensitive information before displaying it on the webpage. The modified code should look something like this: `<%= mask(ssn) %>` and `<%= mask(ccn) %>`. This will ensure that sensitive information is not directly displayed on the webpage, reducing the risk
