VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded credentials are present in the code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded credentials for a username and password. This is a security risk because if the code is exposed or accessed by unauthorized individuals, they will have access to the credentials. Hardcoded credentials should be avoided and instead, consider using environment variables or a secrets management system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secrets management system. For example, you can use the `os` module to load environment variables or a secrets management system like Hashicorp's Vault. ```python
import os

webapp.ldap.username = os.environ['LDAP_USERNAME']
webapp.ldap.password = os.environ['LDAP_PASSWORD']
```  ```bash
export LDAP_USERNAME=secretUsername
export LDAP_PASSWORD=secretPassword
```  ```bash
import hvac

client = hvac.Client(url='http://localhost:8200')
client.secrets.kv.v2.read_secret_version(
    path='secret/ldap',
    version=None
)
```  ```python
webapp.ldap.username = client.secrets.kv.v2.read_secret_version(
