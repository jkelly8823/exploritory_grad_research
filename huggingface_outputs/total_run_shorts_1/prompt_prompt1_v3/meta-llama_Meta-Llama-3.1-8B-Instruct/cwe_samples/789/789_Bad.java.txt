VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of the GetUntrustedInt() function to determine the size of the HashMap. This function may return an arbitrary large value, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the HashMap's capacity and cause a denial of service or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The GetUntrustedInt() function is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate its return value. This can lead to a buffer overflow when creating the HashMap, as the size parameter is not checked for validity. A more secure approach would be to use a validated or sanitized value for the size parameter, or to use a fixed size for the HashMap.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a validated or sanitized value for the size parameter, or use a fixed size for the HashMap. Additionally, consider using a more secure data structure, such as a dynamically-sized array or a vector, which can handle arbitrary sizes without the risk of buffer overflows. It is also recommended to validate and sanitize the input to the GetUntrustedInt() function to prevent arbitrary values from being passed to the HashMap constructor.  Consider using a library or framework
