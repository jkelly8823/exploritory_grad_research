VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of an untrusted input ($num) to index an array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the GetUntrustedNumber() function to retrieve a number, which is then used to index an array. However, the GetUntrustedNumber() function is not validated or sanitized, making it possible for an attacker to manipulate the input and access arbitrary array indices. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, where the program attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the array, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input from GetUntrustedNumber() to ensure it is within a valid range for the array index. This can be done by adding a check to ensure the input is a non-negative integer less than the size of the array. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a hash, to store the messages, which would eliminate the need for array indexing altogether.
