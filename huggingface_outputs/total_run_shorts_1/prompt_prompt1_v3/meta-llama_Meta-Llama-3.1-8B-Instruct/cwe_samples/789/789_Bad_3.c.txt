VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect calculation of buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The function proc_msg() assumes that all strings have a preamble with a space at the end. However, this assumption is violated when the input string does not have a space at the end, leading to a negative value for pre_len. This negative value is then used to calculate the buffer size, which can result in a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function proc_msg() should be modified to handle the case where the input string does not have a space at the end. This can be done by checking the length of the input string and adjusting the buffer size accordingly. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where the input string is NULL. The function should also be modified to check for buffer overflows before writing to the buffer. The function should be modified to use a safer method for calculating the buffer size, such as using the strlen() function. The function should be modified to handle the case where the input string is too long to fit in the buffer. The function should be modified to handle the case where the input string is NULL. The function should be
