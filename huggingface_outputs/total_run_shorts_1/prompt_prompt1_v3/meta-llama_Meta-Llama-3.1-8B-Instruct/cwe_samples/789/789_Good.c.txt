VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code assumes that all strings have a preamble with a space at the end, which is not guaranteed. This can lead to a buffer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer needed to hold the message.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a function proc_msg that calculates the size of a buffer needed to hold a message. It assumes that all strings have a preamble with a space at the end, which is not guaranteed. This can lead to a buffer overflow when calculating the pre_len variable. The code then uses this pre_len variable to calculate the size of the buffer needed to hold the message. If the message length is greater than or equal to the pre_len, it will result in a negative value for the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow when the buffer is allocated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to not assume that all strings have a preamble with a space at the end. Instead, it should calculate the length of the preamble dynamically. This can be done by finding the length of the preamble string and using that value to calculate the size of the buffer needed to hold the message. Additionally, the code should include checks to
