VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a variable length array (VLA) with a user-controlled value.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a variable length array (VLA) to allocate memory for a character buffer. The length of the buffer is determined by the difference between two user-controlled variables, 'a' and 'b'. This creates a buffer overflow vulnerability because an attacker can manipulate the values of 'a' and 'b' to allocate a buffer that is larger than the stack can handle, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer memory allocation method, such as dynamically allocating memory using malloc or new, and checking the return value to ensure that the allocation was successful. Additionally, consider using a safer data type, such as a fixed-size array or a dynamically-sized array with bounds checking. If using a VLA is unavoidable, consider using a safer VLA implementation that checks for overflow before allocating memory.  ```c
int a = 5, b = 6;
size_t len = a - b;
char buf[len];    // Just blows up the stack
