VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential information disclosure due to the direct logging of an exception's toString() method. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application's internal state.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the line where the exception is caught and logged. The toString() method of the exception object is called, which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application's internal state. This is a problem because it can be used by an attacker to gather information about the application's configuration, security settings, or other sensitive details.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the application should log the exception's message instead of its toString() method. This can be achieved by calling the getMessage() method of the exception object instead of toString(). For example: logger.error("Caught: " + ase.getMessage());. This will prevent sensitive information from being logged and reduce the risk of information disclosure. Additionally, consider implementing a custom exception handler that can handle sensitive exceptions in a secure manner. . 

Note: The ApplicationSpecificException class is assumed to be a custom exception class that may contain sensitive information. The logger object is assumed to be a logging object that writes to
