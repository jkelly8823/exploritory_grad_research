VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) due to the presence of multiple Content-Length headers. This allows an attacker to manipulate the request body and potentially inject malicious data.
EXPLANATION: The code checks for multiple Content-Length headers, but it does not remove or ignore them. This allows an attacker to send a request with multiple Content-Length headers, which can be used to manipulate the request body and inject malicious data. This is a classic example of HTTP Request Smuggling.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should remove or ignore any Content-Length headers other than the first one. This can be done by using the `request.getContentLength()` method, which returns the content length of the request body. The code should also consider using a more robust method to parse the request body, such as using a library like Apache Commons IO. Additionally, the code should consider implementing a Content-Length header validation mechanism to prevent attacks.
