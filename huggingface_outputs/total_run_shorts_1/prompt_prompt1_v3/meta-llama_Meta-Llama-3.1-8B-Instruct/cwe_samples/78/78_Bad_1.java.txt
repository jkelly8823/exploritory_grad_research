VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability. The input to the Runtime.exec() method is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
EXPLANATION: The Runtime.exec() method is vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker can inject malicious commands by manipulating the input to the method. In this case, the input is the coordinates string, which is not sanitized or validated. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the input to the Runtime.exec() method should be sanitized and validated to prevent command injection attacks. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides a safe way to execute commands. Additionally, the use of Runtime.exec() should be avoided in favor of a safer alternative, such as using a library that provides a safe way to execute commands. The code should also be updated to handle exceptions properly, rather than catching all exceptions and ignoring them. Finally, the code should be updated to return a meaningful value in the case of an exception, rather than returning null.  The code should also be updated to handle the case where the
