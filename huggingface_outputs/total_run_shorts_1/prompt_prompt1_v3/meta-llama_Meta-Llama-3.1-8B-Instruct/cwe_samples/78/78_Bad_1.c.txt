VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A command injection vulnerability exists in this code. The `system` function is used to execute a command that is constructed by concatenating user input (`argv[1]`) with a fixed string (`cat`). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the input string.
EXPLANATION: The `strncpy` and `strncat` functions are used to construct the command string, but they do not perform any validation or sanitization of the input. This means that an attacker can inject malicious commands by manipulating the input string. For example, if the input string is `; rm -rf /`, the resulting command would be `cat ; rm -rf /`, which would execute the `rm -rf /` command, potentially leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to construct the command string, such as using `snprintf` or `sprintf` with a format string. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize the input string to prevent any malicious commands from being executed. For example, the code could use a whitelist of allowed characters or use a library like
