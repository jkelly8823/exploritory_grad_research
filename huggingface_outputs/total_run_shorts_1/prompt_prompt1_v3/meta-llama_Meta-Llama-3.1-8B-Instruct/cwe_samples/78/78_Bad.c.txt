VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. An attacker can inject malicious commands by manipulating the value of argv[1].
EXPLANATION: The system function is used to execute a command in a shell. However, the command is constructed by concatenating a fixed string with the value of argv[1] without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the value of argv[1]. For example, if argv[1] is "/etc/passwd; rm -rf /", the command executed will be "/usr/bin/cat /etc/passwd; rm -rf /", which will delete the entire file system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer function like execve to execute the command, or use a library like libssh2 to execute the command securely. Alternatively, use a safer way to construct the command, such as using a format string with placeholders for the input values. Additionally, always validate and sanitize user input to prevent command injection attacks.  Also, consider using a safer way to store the command, such as using a buffer that is large enough to hold the entire command, and using a function like snprintf
