VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the 'name' parameter.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the fact that the 'name' parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the 'name' parameter. The use of the 'open' function to execute a system command also makes the code vulnerable to command injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a whitelist approach to validate the 'name' parameter. This can be achieved by checking if the 'name' parameter matches a specific pattern or regular expression. Additionally, the code should use a safer method to execute system commands, such as using the 'exec' function with a properly sanitized command string. The 'open' function should be avoided as it can be used for command injection attacks. The'system' function is also not recommended as it can be used for command injection attacks. The 'exec' function is safer but still requires proper sanitization of the command string. The 'qx' function is also not recommended as it can
