 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANANATION: The code uses the `System.exec()` method to execute a command specified by the user. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious activities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method to execute commands, such as `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` with proper input validation and sanitization. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed commands. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent command injection attacks. Consider using a library like Apache Commons Exec to simplify and secure command execution.  Use a secure method to retrieve the script name, such as using a configuration file or a secure environment variable.  Consider using a sandboxed environment to execute the command, such as a JVM sandbox or a containerized environment.  Always log and monitor the execution of commands to detect and respond to potential security incidents.  Consider implementing a security framework or a security library to help detect and prevent command injection attacks.  Always follow secure coding practices and guidelines, such as those provided by OWASP.  Consider using a code analysis tool to identify and fix potential security
