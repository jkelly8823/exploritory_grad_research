VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker can open a new window with a malicious URL that can steal sensitive information or perform malicious actions.
EXPLANATION: The code opens a new window with a URL that is not validated or sanitized. An attacker can exploit this by opening a new window with a malicious URL that can steal sensitive information or perform malicious actions. This is a classic example of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the URL before opening a new window. You can use a library like DOMPurify to sanitize the URL and prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, you can use a secure protocol like HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering attacks. Finally, you can use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed. This will help prevent XSS attacks and ensure that only trusted content is executed in the new window.  ```javascript
var sanitizedUrl = DOMPurify.sanitize("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html");
var newWindow
