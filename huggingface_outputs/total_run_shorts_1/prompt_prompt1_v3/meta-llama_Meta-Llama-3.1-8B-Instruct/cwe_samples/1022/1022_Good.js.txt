VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a DOM-based XSS attack. An attacker can manipulate the "useful-page.html" parameter to inject malicious JavaScript code.
EXPLANATION: The `window.open` function is used to open a new window with a URL that can be controlled by an attacker. By setting the `opener` property to `null`, the attacker can prevent the original window from accessing the new window, making it difficult to detect the attack. This type of attack is known as a DOM-based XSS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, do not use the `window.open` function to open a new window with a URL that can be controlled by an attacker. Instead, use a secure method such as using a server-side redirect or a secure URL generation library. Additionally, validate all user input to prevent XSS attacks. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed.  Also, ensure that the `opener` property is not set to `null` to allow the original window to access the new window. 

Note: The code is vulnerable because it allows an attacker to
