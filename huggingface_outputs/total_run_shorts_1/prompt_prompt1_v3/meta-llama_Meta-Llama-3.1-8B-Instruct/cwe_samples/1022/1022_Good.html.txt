VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a clickjacking attack due to the use of the target attribute with the value "_blank".
EXPLANATION: The target attribute with the value "_blank" allows an attacker to trick the user into clicking on a link that opens a malicious page in a new tab. This is a common technique used in clickjacking attacks.

The rel attribute only helps to prevent the window.opener property from being
