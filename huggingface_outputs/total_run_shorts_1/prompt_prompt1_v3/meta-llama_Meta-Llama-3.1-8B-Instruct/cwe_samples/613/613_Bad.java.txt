VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The session timeout is set to -1, which can cause the session to never timeout, potentially leading to session fixation attacks.
EXPLANATION: 
The session timeout is set to -1, which is an invalid value. According to the Java Servlet Specification, the session timeout should be a positive integer. Setting the session timeout to -1 can cause the session to never timeout, potentially leading to session fixation attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by fixing the session ID and then waiting for the session to time out, allowing them to access the user's session.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Set the session timeout to a positive integer value, such as 30 minutes. This will ensure that the session times out after a reasonable amount of time, preventing session fixation attacks. For example: <session-config><session-timeout>30</session-timeout></session-config>. 

Note: The session timeout should be set to a reasonable value based on the application's requirements and security needs.
