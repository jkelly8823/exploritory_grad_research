VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The clone method in the Kibitzer class does not properly implement the Cloneable interface, and the clone method in the FancyKibitzer class does not override the clone method from the Kibitzer class correctly.
EXPLANATION: The clone method in the Kibitzer class does not implement the Cloneable interface, which is required for the clone method to work correctly. The clone method in the Kibitzer class creates a new instance of the Kibitzer class, but it does not check if the class is Cloneable before calling the clone method. This can lead to a CloneNotSupportedException being thrown. The clone method in the FancyKibitzer class overrides the clone method from the Kibitzer class, but it does not call the super.clone() method correctly. It should call the super.clone() method to create a new instance of the Kibitzer class, but instead it calls the clone method directly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The clone method in the Kibitzer class should be modified to implement the Cloneable interface and check if the class is Cloneable before calling the clone method. The clone method in the FancyKibitzer
