VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to the use of a hardcoded password in the mysql_pconnect function.
EXPLANATION: The mysql_pconnect function is being used with a hardcoded password, which is a security risk. This password is being passed in plain text, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the password.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use a secure method to store and retrieve the database password, such as environment variables or a secure configuration file.
2. Consider using a more secure database connection method, such as PDO or MySQLi, which provide better security features and are more resistant to SQL injection attacks. 
3. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information, such as passwords, directly in the code. Instead, use a secure method to store and retrieve this information. 4. Consider implementing a password hashing and verification mechanism to protect against brute-force attacks. 5. Regularly review and update the database connection code to ensure it remains secure. 6. Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against SQL injection attacks. 7. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
