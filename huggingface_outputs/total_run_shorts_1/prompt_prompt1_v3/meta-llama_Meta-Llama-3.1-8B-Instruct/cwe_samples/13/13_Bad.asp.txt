VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded database credentials are present in the code. This makes it easier for unauthorized users to access the database.
EXPLANATION: The connection string contains the database username and password, which are hardcoded in the code. This makes it difficult to change or update the credentials without modifying the code. It also poses a security risk if the code is exposed or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive database credentials. This will allow for easier management and updating of the credentials without modifying the code. Consider using a library or framework that supports secure configuration management, such as Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Additionally, ensure that the connection string is not committed to the code repository to prevent accidental exposure. Consider using a separate configuration file or a secrets manager to store the connection string.  Also, use a secure method to pass the connection string to the application, such as using a secure protocol like HTTPS.  Consider using a connection string builder to construct the connection string at runtime, rather than hardcoding it in the code.  This will allow for more flexibility and security when managing database connections.  Consider using a
