VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: CWE-259: Hard-coded password. CWE-309: Authentication bypass through use of hard-coded password. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer: The AuthenticateUser function uses strncmp to compare the user inputted password to the hardcoded password. The strncmp function does not check the bounds of the memory buffer, allowing for potential buffer overflow attacks.
EXPLANATION: The AuthenticateUser function uses strncmp to compare the user inputted password to the hardcoded password. The strncmp function does not check the bounds of the memory buffer, allowing for potential buffer overflow attacks. The hardcoded password is stored in a global variable and is not protected by any form of access control. This makes it vulnerable to authentication bypass attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The hardcoded password should be removed and replaced with a secure password storage mechanism, such as a hash of the password stored in a database. The AuthenticateUser function should be modified to use a secure password comparison function, such as a function that checks the bounds of the memory buffer. Additionally, access control mechanisms should be implemented
