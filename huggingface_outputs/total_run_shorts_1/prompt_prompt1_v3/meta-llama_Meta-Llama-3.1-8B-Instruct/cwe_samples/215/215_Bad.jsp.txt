VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attacks. The use of <%= %> syntax to inject user input (acctNo) directly into the HTML output allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the JSP expression language to inject the value of acctNo into the HTML output. However, this allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating the value of acctNo. For example, an attacker could set the value of acctNo to something like " ${1+1}" to inject arbitrary code. This is a classic example of a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a safe method to display the value of acctNo, such as using a String.format() method or a StringBuilder to concatenate the value. For example: "User account number: " + acctNo. This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary code into the HTML output. Additionally, the debugEnabled flag should be validated and sanitized to prevent an attacker from manipulating the flag to inject code.  The code should also be
