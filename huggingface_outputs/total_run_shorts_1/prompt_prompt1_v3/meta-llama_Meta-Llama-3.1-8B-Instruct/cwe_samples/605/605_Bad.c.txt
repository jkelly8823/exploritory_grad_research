VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of a fixed-size buffer (server_address) to store a potentially large IP address.
EXPLANATION: The server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY); line is attempting to bind the socket to all available network interfaces. However, the INADDR_ANY constant is a 32-bit integer that can be larger than the size of the server_address.sin_addr.s_addr field, which is a 32-bit unsigned integer. This can cause a buffer overflow when the INADDR_ANY constant is assigned to the server_address.sin_addr.s_addr field.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use the INADDR_ANY constant directly in the bind() function, like so: bind(server_sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &server_address, server_len);. Alternatively, use the INADDR_ANY constant to set the server_address.sin_addr.s_addr field, but ensure that the server_address.sin_addr.s_addr field is large enough to hold the INADDR_ANY constant. For example: server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; server_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in); bind(server_sockfd, (struct
