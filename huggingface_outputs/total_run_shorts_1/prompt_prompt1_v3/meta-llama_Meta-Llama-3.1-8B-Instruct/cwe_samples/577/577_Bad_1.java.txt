VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of a busy-waiting loop in the constructor. This can cause the server to consume excessive CPU resources and potentially lead to a denial-of-service.
EXPLANATION: The constructor of the StockSymbolBean class starts a new thread and enters an infinite loop, continuously accepting new connections. This can cause the server to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service. This is a classic example of a busy-waiting loop, which is generally considered a bad practice in multithreaded programming.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more efficient approach, such as using a thread pool or a non-blocking I/O model. Additionally, consider using a more robust way to handle incoming connections, such as using a connection queue or a selector. This will help prevent the server from consuming excessive CPU resources and reduce the risk of a denial-of-service attack.
