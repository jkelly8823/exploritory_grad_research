VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The use of a static key for encryption is a vulnerability. Static keys are easily compromised and should be avoided in favor of dynamic keys generated at runtime.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a static key for encryption, which is a significant vulnerability. The key is generated using RAND_bytes, but it is generated only once and stored in memory. This makes it vulnerable to attacks such as key extraction or tampering. Additionally, the key is not properly initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. It is recommended to generate the key dynamically at runtime and store it securely.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Generate the key dynamically at runtime using a secure random number generator.
2. Store the key securely, such as in a secure key store or a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
3. Initialize the key properly before using it for encryption. 
4. Consider using a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES, which is widely considered to be secure. 
5. Avoid using static keys for encryption in favor of dynamic keys generated at runtime. 
6. Consider using a secure key exchange protocol, such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to
