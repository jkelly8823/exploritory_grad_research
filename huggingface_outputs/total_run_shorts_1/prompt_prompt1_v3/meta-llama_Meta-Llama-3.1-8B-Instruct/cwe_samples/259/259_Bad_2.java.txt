VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded credentials are present in the code. This is a security risk as it allows unauthorized access to the system.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded credentials for a web application's LDAP username and password. Hardcoded credentials are a security risk as they can be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables or a secure secrets management system. This will prevent hardcoded credentials from being exposed in the codebase. Consider using a secrets management tool like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage sensitive information. Additionally, ensure that environment variables are not committed to version control to prevent accidental exposure.  Consider using a tool like Git Secrets to mask sensitive information in the commit history.  Consider using a tool like OWASP's ZAP to scan for hardcoded credentials in the codebase.  Consider using a tool like OWASP's ESAPI to encode sensitive information in the codebase.  Consider using a tool like OWASP's ESAPI to encode sensitive information in the codebase.
