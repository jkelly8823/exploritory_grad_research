VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly embeds user input ("scott" and "tiger") into the SQL query.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the DriverManager.getConnection method to establish a database connection. However, it directly passes user input ("scott" and "tiger") as the username and password, respectively. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the username and password inputs. For example, an attacker could input "scott' OR '1'='1" as the username, which would allow them to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can be achieved by using the PreparedStatement class and its setString method to set the username and password as parameters. For example: String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"; String username = "scott"; String password = "tiger"; Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url); PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username =? AND password =?");
