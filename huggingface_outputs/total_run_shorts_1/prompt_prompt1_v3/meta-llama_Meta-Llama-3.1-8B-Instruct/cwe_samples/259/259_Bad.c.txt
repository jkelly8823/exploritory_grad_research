VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `strcmp` function without bounds checking. An attacker could potentially craft a password that is longer than the buffer allocated for the `password` variable, leading to a buffer overflow.
EXPLANATION: The `strcmp` function compares two strings character by character, but it does not perform any bounds checking. If the password is longer than the buffer allocated for the `password` variable, the function will continue to compare characters beyond the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to perform bounds checking on the `password` variable before passing it to the `strcmp` function. This can be done by checking the length of the password against the size of the buffer allocated for it. If the password is too long, the function should return an error or take other appropriate action. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a safer function, such as `strncmp`, which performs bounds checking by default. The
