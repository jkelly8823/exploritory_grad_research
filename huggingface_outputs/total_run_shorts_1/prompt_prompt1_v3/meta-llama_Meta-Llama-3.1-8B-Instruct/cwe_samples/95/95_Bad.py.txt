VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack due to the use of the eval() function on user input.
EXPLANATION: The eval() function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious code by entering a string that contains a Python expression. For example, if the user enters "1 + 2; os.system('ls')", the eval() function will execute the expression and run the "ls" command, potentially leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the eval() function with a safer alternative, such as using the ast module to parse the input string as a Python expression, or using a library like numexpr to evaluate mathematical expressions. Alternatively, you can use a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may be raised when evaluating the input string. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input string and only allow specific characters or expressions.
