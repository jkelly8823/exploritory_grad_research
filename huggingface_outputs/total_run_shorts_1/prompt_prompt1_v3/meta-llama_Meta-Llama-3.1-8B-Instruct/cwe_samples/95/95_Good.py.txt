VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it is worth noting that the code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. This could potentially lead to a division by zero error if the code were to be modified to calculate an average or other value based on the input list.
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a try-except block to catch any ValueError exceptions that may occur when attempting to convert the input strings to integers. This is a good practice to prevent the program from crashing due to invalid input. However, as mentioned earlier, the code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. This could potentially lead to a division by zero error if the code were to be modified to calculate an average or other value based on the input list.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this potential issue, the code could be modified to check if the input list is empty before attempting to calculate the sum. This could be done by adding a simple if statement to check the length of the input list. For example:
```
if len(numbers) == 0:
    print("Error: input list is empty")
else:
