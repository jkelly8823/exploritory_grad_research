VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the `request.getParameter("reportName")` method does not perform any validation on the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious directory traversal characters (e.g., `../`) into the `rName` variable. When concatenated with the directory path, this can lead to the deletion of arbitrary files outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the input from `request.getParameter("reportName")` to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters and does not contain any directory traversal characters. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to sanitize the input. Additionally, consider using a more secure method to construct the file path, such as using the `Path` class from Java's `java.nio.file` package. The corrected code should look something like this: `String rName = request.getParameter("reportName"); String sanitizedName = rName.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", ""); File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + sanitizedName);` Note
