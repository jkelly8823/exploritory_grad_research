VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not check for the return value of rmtmp() after calling it. If rmttmp() fails, the file descriptor will not be closed, leading to a resource leak.
EXPLANATION: The rmtmp() function is called without checking its return value. If rmtmp() fails, the file descriptor will not be closed, resulting in a resource leak. This can lead to issues such as file descriptor exhaustion, especially in long-running programs.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of rmtmp() and handle any errors that may occur. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check the return value and handle the error accordingly. For example: if (rmtmp() == -1) { perror("Error removing temporary file"); return (-1); }. This will ensure that the file descriptor is closed even if rmtmp() fails.  ```c
                  FILE *stream;if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {
                        
                           perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");return (-1);
                     }
                     // write data to tmp file
                    ...
