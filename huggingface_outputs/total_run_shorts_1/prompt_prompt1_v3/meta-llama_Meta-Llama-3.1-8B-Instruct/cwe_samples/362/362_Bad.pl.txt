VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the direct use of user input in database queries.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the GetTransferAmount() and GetBalanceFromDatabase() functions to retrieve data from an unknown source. However, it does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the retrieved data. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the functions are not properly implemented. Additionally, the code does not check for null or empty values before using them in calculations, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The GetTransferAmount() and GetBalanceFromDatabase() functions should be reviewed and modified to perform input validation and sanitization. The code should also check for null or empty values before using them in calculations. Furthermore, the FatalError() function should be replaced with a more robust error handling mechanism to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. 

Note: The code snippet does not contain any actual database queries, but the potential for SQL injection attacks is still present due to the use of
