VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to the use of user input in the getServerStatus() function without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The getServerStatus() function is likely to be a database query that retrieves server status information. However, the function is called with no input validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the $requestingIP variable, which is used to call the getServerStatus() function.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the getServerStatus() function should be modified to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the $requestingIP variable should be validated and sanitized before being used to call the getServerStatus() function. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach to validate the IP address against a list of allowed IP addresses. For example: if (in_array($requestingIP, $ipAllowList) && preg_match('/^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$/', $requestingIP)) {... } This will ensure that only
