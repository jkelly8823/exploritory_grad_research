VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns a pointer to an X509 structure, but it does not check if this pointer is null before dereferencing it. If the peer certificate is not present, this function will return null, and the subsequent call to SSL_get_verify_result will result in a null pointer dereference.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided checks if the peer certificate is present using the SSL_get_peer_certificate function. However, it does not check if the returned pointer is null before calling SSL_get_verify_result. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the peer certificate is not present. This is a potential security vulnerability because it can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the returned pointer from SSL_get_peer_certificate is null before calling SSL_get_verify_result. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the if statement. For example: if (cert!= NULL && cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {... } This will prevent the null pointer dereference and ensure
