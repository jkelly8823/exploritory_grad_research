VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential data exposure vulnerability due to the public getter method for the patientList array. This allows any external entity to access the list of patients, potentially exposing sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the public getPatients() method, which returns the entire patientList array. This can be exploited by an attacker to access the list of patients, potentially leading to data exposure. A more secure approach would be to return a copy of the list or to use a private getter method.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider making the getPatients() method private or returning a copy of the patientList array. This can be achieved by modifying the method to return a new array or a collection, such as ArrayList, that contains the patients. For example: public ArrayList<PatientClass> getPatients() { return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(patientList)); } This ensures that the internal state of the ClinicalTrial object is not exposed to external entities. Additionally, consider using access modifiers to restrict access to the patientList array, such as making it private and providing a private getter method. This will help prevent unauthorized access to the
