VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a configuration file path disclosure attack. An attacker could potentially manipulate the "config.properties" file to reveal sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The code reads a configuration file named "config.properties" from the current working directory. This file likely contains sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys. An attacker could manipulate the file path to reveal this sensitive information. For example, an attacker could create a symbolic link to a sensitive file and trick the application into reading it instead of the intended configuration file.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should read the configuration file from a secure location, such as a classpath resource or an environment variable. The code should also validate the file path to ensure it is not a symbolic link to a sensitive file. Additionally, the configuration file should be encrypted to protect sensitive information. The code should also use a secure method to store and retrieve sensitive information, such as a secrets manager.
