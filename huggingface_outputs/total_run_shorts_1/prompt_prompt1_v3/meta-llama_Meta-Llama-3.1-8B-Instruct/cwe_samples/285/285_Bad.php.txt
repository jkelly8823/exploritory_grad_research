VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Input During SQL Command or Query Input Utilization
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks, but it does not properly sanitize the input. The variable $name is directly inserted into the SQL query without any validation or sanitization. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a whitelist approach to validate the input data. For example, you can use a regular expression to check if the input matches a specific pattern. Additionally, consider using a parameterized query or an ORM that can handle input validation and sanitization for you. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the definition of $globalDbHandle, which is assumed to be a database handle object. The code snippet also assumes that the database connection is already established.
