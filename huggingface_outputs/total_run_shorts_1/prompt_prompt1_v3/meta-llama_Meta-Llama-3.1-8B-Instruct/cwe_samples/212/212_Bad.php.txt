VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANANATION: The vulnerability is present in the line where the $username variable is assigned a value from the $_GET['user'] superglobal. This is because the value is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The vulnerability is also present in the line where the getUserRecord function is called, as it does not appear to be using prepared statements or parameterized queries.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. You can use the PDO extension in PHP to achieve this. For example, you can use the following code to retrieve the user record: $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username'); $stmt->execute(array(':username' => $username)); $record = $stmt->fetch(); This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, you should validate and sanitize all user input to prevent other types of attacks.
