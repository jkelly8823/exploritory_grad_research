VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition when handling signals. This is because the signal handler function is not thread-safe and can be interrupted by other signals while it is executing.
EXPLANATION: The signal handler function is not protected against concurrent access, which means that if multiple signals are received while the handler is executing, it can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the signal handler function should be made thread-safe by using a mutex or other synchronization mechanism to protect access to shared resources. Additionally, the signal handler function should be designed to handle multiple signals in a way that prevents race conditions. This can be achieved by using a flag to indicate whether the handler is currently executing and checking this flag before executing the handler. If the flag is set, the handler should return immediately without executing its code. This approach is known as "signal queuing" and is a common technique for handling signals in a thread-safe manner.  The code should be modified to use this approach to prevent race conditions when handling signals.  The code
