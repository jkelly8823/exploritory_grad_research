VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. An attacker can manipulate the filename to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the basename function to extract the filename from the uploaded file, but it does not validate the filename. An attacker can manipulate the filename to access files outside of the intended directory by using directory traversal techniques such as '../' or './'. For example, if the attacker uploads a file named '../secret.txt', the code will save the file in the 'pictures' directory, but the actual file path will be '../secret.txt', allowing the attacker to access the file outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the filename to ensure it does not contain any directory traversal characters. This can be done by using a whitelist approach, where only certain characters are allowed in the filename. Alternatively, the code can use a more secure method to store the uploaded file, such as using a random filename or storing the file in a temporary directory. Additionally, the code should also check the file extension to ensure it is allowed.  The code should also check the file size to
