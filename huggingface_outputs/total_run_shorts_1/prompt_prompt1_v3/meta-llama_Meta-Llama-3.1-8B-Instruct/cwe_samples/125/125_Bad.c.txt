VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function will attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the array when the index is invalid, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function attempts to access the array at the index `array[index]` when the index is invalid, which can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the array. This can potentially cause a buffer overflow or undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Instead of accessing the array at the invalid index, the function should handle the error by returning an error value or throwing an exception. Additionally, the function should check if the index is valid before attempting to access the array. The corrected code should be: ```c
if (index < len) {
    value = array[index];
} else {
    printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]); // This line is incorrect and should be removed
    return -1;
}
``` 
However, the corrected code should not attempt to access the array at the invalid index. The correct code should be: ```c
if (index < len) {
    value = array[index];
} else {
    printf("Invalid index\n");
