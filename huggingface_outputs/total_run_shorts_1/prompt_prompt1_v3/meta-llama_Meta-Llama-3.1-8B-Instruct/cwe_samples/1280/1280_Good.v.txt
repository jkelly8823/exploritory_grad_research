VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability is present due to a potential race condition in the assignment of grant_access and data_out. This can occur when rst_n is de-asserted, and the value of grant_access is still being evaluated.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the use of the non-blocking assign statement (assign) within the if-else block. The non-blocking assign statement is not executed immediately, but rather at the end of the current clock cycle. This can lead to a situation where grant_access is still being evaluated when rst_n is de-asserted, resulting in an unpredictable value being assigned to grant_access. This, in turn, can cause data_out to be assigned an incorrect value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using blocking assign statements instead of non-blocking assign statements within the if-else block. Additionally, ensure that grant_access is fully evaluated before de-asserting rst_n. This can be achieved by using a blocking assign statement and ensuring that the if-else block is fully evaluated before de-asserting rst_n. Alternatively, consider using a different design approach that avoids the use of non-blocking assign statements
