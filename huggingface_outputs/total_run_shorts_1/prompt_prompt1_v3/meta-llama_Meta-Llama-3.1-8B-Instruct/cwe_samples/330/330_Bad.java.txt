VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to predictable random number generation. The seed for the random number generator is set to the current time in milliseconds, which is predictable and can be exploited by an attacker.
EXPLANATION: The use of the current time in milliseconds as a seed for the random number generator is a common mistake. This is because the time is predictable and can be easily guessed by an attacker. In a real-world scenario, an attacker could potentially generate a large number of receipts with the same random number, allowing them to manipulate the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead of the standard Random class. This can be achieved by using the SecureRandom class, which is designed to generate cryptographically strong random numbers. Additionally, the seed should be generated from a secure source, such as a hardware random number generator or a secure random number generator. The code should be modified to use a CSPRNG to generate the random number, like this: `SecureRandom ranGen = new SecureRandom(); ranGen.setSeed(new byte[20]); ranGen.next
