VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the direct use of user input in a switch statement. This allows an attacker to manipulate the role of the requesting user and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement is using the role of the requesting user, which is set by the user themselves. This means that an attacker can manipulate the role by providing a malicious input, potentially gaining access to the system. This is a classic example of a SQL injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a secure method of determining the user's role, such as using a database query or a secure authentication mechanism. The switch statement should be replaced with a more secure approach, such as using a Map or a EnumSet to store the roles and their corresponding permissions. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized and validated. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the implementation of the isAuthenticated method and the setPassword method, but the vulnerability is still present in the switch statement.
