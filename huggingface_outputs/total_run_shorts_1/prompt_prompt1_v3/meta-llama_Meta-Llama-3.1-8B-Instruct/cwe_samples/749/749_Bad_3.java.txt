VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential null pointer exception. The method getUserInfo() is annotated with @JavascriptInterface, which means it will be called from JavaScript. However, the method currentUser.Info() is not checked for null before being called, which could result in a null pointer exception if currentUser is null.
EXPLANATION: The method getUserInfo() is annotated with @JavascriptInterface, which means it will be called from JavaScript. This means that the method will be executed in a different thread and context than the rest of the Java code. In this context, the method currentUser.Info() is not checked for null before being called, which could result in a null pointer exception if currentUser is null. This is a potential vulnerability because it could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior of the application.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a null check before calling currentUser.Info(). For example, you could add a simple if statement to check if currentUser is not null before calling Info(). Here is an example of how you could modify the method: @JavascriptInterfacepublic String getUserInfo() {if (currentUser!= null) {return currentUser.Info();} else {
