VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly concatenates user input (databaseName) into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the databaseName parameter. For example, if an attacker passes a databaseName of "my_database; DROP TABLE users;", the SQL query would become "DROP DATABASE my_database; DROP TABLE users;", which would result in the deletion of the users table.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement with parameterized queries. This will prevent the attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. The corrected code would be: stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE?"); and then stmt.setString(1, databaseName);. This way, the databaseName is treated as a parameter and not as part of the SQL query. Alternatively, you can use a ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that supports parameterized queries.  ```java
public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("DROP DATABASE?");
        pstmt.setString(1, databaseName);
        pstmt.execute();
    } catch (SQLException
