VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a UIWebView clickjacking attack. This is because the shouldStartLoadWithRequest method is not properly validating the request, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web view.
EXPLANATION: The shouldStartLoadWithRequest method is responsible for determining whether a web view should load a given URL. However, in this implementation, the method is not properly validating the request, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web view. Specifically, the code is checking if the URL scheme is "exampleScheme" and if the resource specifier starts with "specialFunction". However, this is not sufficient to prevent clickjacking attacks. An attacker could still inject malicious JavaScript code into the web view by modifying the URL query string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the shouldStartLoadWithRequest method should be modified to properly validate the request. This can be done by checking the URL scheme and resource specifier more thoroughly, and also by checking the URL query string for any malicious JavaScript code. Additionally, the method should be modified to prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the web view. This can be done
