VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. The `writeDataToView` function is not shown in this snippet, but it is likely that it is used to display user input in a WebView, which can lead to a XSS vulnerability if the input is not properly sanitized.
EXPLANATION: The `writeDataToView` function is called with the `UserData` variable, which is not shown in this snippet. However, if `UserData` is a user-input variable, then this code can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the WebView. This can lead to a XSS attack, where the attacker can steal sensitive information or take control of the user's session.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `writeDataToView` function should be modified to properly sanitize the user input before displaying it in the WebView. This can be done by using a library like Jsoup to parse the input and remove any malicious JavaScript code. Additionally, the `UserData` variable should be validated to ensure that it is not user-input. If it is user-input, then it should be
