VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to JavaScript injection attacks due to the use of addJavascriptInterface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the WebView.
EXPLANATION: The addJavascriptInterface method allows JavaScript code running in the WebView to access Java objects and methods. In this case, the JavaScriptInterface class is exposed to JavaScript, allowing an attacker to call the getUserInfo method and potentially access sensitive information. This is a serious vulnerability as it allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the WebView.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, remove the addJavascriptInterface method call and instead use a secure method to pass data from the Java application to the WebView. One possible solution is to use a ContentProvider to pass data from the Java application to the WebView. Another solution is to use a secure communication protocol such as HTTPS to pass data from the Java application to the WebView. Additionally, ensure that the getUserInfo method does not return sensitive information. If it does, consider removing the method or modifying it to return a secure representation of the data.
