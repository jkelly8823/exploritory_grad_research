VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path traversal vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it uses the `getCanonicalPath()` method to get the absolute path of the file. However, this method does not prevent the attacker from traversing the directory structure. An attacker could manipulate the `path` variable to point to a file outside of the intended directory, potentially allowing them to access sensitive information or execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a validated path to get the absolute path of the file. For example, you can use the `Paths.get()` method from the `java.nio.file.Paths` class to create a `Path` object that is validated to be within the intended directory. Additionally, consider using a library that provides a more secure way to handle file paths, such as Apache Commons IO. ```java
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// ...

Path path = Paths.get(getInputPath());
if (path.startsWith(Paths.get("/safe_dir/"))) {
    return path.toString();
}
```
