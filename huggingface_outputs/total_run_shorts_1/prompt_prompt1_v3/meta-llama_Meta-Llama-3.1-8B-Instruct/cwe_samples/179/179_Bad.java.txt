VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet is vulnerable to path traversal attacks because it does not properly sanitize the input path.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses the getInputPath() method to retrieve the input path, which could potentially contain malicious characters. The startsWith() method is used to check if the path starts with "/safe_dir/", but this does not prevent an attacker from providing a path that is outside of the safe directory. An attacker could provide a path like "/safe_dir/../../../../etc/passwd" to traverse outside of the safe directory and access sensitive files.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input path. Instead of checking if the path starts with "/safe_dir/", use a regular expression to match the path against a set of allowed patterns.
2. Use the File.listFiles() method to get a list of files in the safe directory, and then use the File.isDirectory() method to check if the provided path is a subdirectory of the safe directory.
3. Use a library like Apache Commons IO to handle file path manipulation and validation. This can help to prevent common mistakes and ensure that the code is secure.
