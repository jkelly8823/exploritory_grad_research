VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function createDir is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it does not properly validate the directory name. It only checks if the directory name contains the sequence '..', but this is not sufficient to prevent path traversal attacks. 
EXPLANATION: The function createDir allows the user to specify the directory name, which is then used to construct the full path of the directory. However, the function does not properly validate this directory name. It checks if the directory name contains the sequence '..', which is a common sequence used in path traversal attacks. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent these attacks. An attacker could use a directory name that contains a sequence of '../' to traverse up the directory hierarchy and access sensitive files or directories.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function createDir should be modified to properly validate the directory name. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed characters or by using a library that provides path validation functionality. Additionally, the function should be modified to not use the user-supplied directory name directly in the construction of the full path. Instead, the function should use a path manipulation library to ensure that the directory name
