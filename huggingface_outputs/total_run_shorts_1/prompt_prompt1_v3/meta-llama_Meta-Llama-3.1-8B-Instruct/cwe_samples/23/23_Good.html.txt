VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a file upload vulnerability. An attacker can upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to code execution or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The form is configured to upload files to a servlet named "FileUploadServlet". However, the servlet's code is not provided, and it is likely that it does not properly validate or sanitize the uploaded files. This makes it possible for an attacker to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts or other executable code, which could be executed on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the servlet should be modified to properly validate and sanitize the uploaded files. This can be done by checking the file type and size, and by using a library such as OWASP ESAPI to sanitize the file contents. Additionally, the servlet should be configured to only allow uploads to a specific directory, and the directory should be configured to have restricted permissions to prevent the uploaded files from being executed.  The servlet should also be configured to handle file uploads in a way that prevents directory traversal attacks.  Finally, the servlet should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is properly handling file uploads and preventing any
