VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is because the user input is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query. The mysql_real_escape_string() function is used to escape the user input, but it is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the user input. For example, an attacker can inject a SQL comment by entering a user input of " OR 1=1 --". This will cause the SQL query to return all rows in the database, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the SQL query. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. You can use the PDO extension in PHP to implement prepared statements. Additionally, you should validate and sanitize user input before using it in the SQL query. You can use a library like OWASP ESAPI to validate user input. Finally, you should consider upgrading to a more secure database driver like MySQLi or PDO, which provides better security features than
