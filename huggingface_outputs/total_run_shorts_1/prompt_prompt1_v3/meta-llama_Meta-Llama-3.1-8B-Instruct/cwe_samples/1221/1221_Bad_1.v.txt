VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. The `assign` statement attempts to access memory locations outside of the `mem` array's bounds.
EXPLANATION: The `mem` array is declared to have a size of `MEM_SIZE`, which is 100. However, the `assign` statement attempts to access memory locations at indices `JTAG_OFFSET-1` through `JTAG_OFFSET-8`. Since `JTAG_OFFSET` is 81, these indices are outside of the array's bounds, causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `assign` statement should be modified to access memory locations within the `mem` array's bounds. This can be achieved by changing the indices to be within the range of 0 to `MEM_SIZE-1`. For example, the corrected `assign` statement could be: `assign jtag_hash_o = {mem[JTAG_OFFSET],mem[JTAG_OFFSET+1],mem[JTAG_OFFSET+2],mem[JTAG_OFFSET+3],mem[JTAG_OFFSET+4],mem[JTAG_OFFSET+5],mem[JTAG_OFFSET+6],mem[JTAG
