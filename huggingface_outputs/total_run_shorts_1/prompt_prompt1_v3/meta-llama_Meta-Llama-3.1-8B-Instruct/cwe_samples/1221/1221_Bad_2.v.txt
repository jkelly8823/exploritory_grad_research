VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential data corruption due to a race condition between the reset signal and the clock signal.
EXPLANATION: The always block is triggered by a positive edge on the clock signal, but the reset condition is checked before the for loop. This can lead to a situation where the reset signal is asserted, but the for loop is still executed, potentially corrupting the memory. This is a classic example of a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the reset condition should be checked after the for loop, ensuring that the memory is not accessed while the reset signal is asserted. Alternatively, the always block can be triggered by a negative edge on the clock signal, avoiding the race condition altogether. 

Note: The AcCt_MEM_SIZE variable is assumed to be a constant or a parameter, and the acct_mem array is assumed to be a valid memory array. The code is written in Verilog.  Please assume that all necessary declarations and definitions are present in the surrounding code.  The code is part of a digital circuit, and the clk_i and rst_ni signals are clock and reset signals, respectively.  The rst_6
