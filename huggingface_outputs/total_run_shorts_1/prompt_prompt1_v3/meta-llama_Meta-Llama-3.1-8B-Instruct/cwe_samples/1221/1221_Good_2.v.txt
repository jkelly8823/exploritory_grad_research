VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) in a for loop. This can lead to a race condition if the loop is interrupted or if the code is executed concurrently by multiple threads.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a for loop to initialize the `acct_mem` array with zeros. However, the use of a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) in a for loop can lead to a race condition if the loop is interrupted or if the code is executed concurrently by multiple threads. This is because the non-blocking assignment does not guarantee that the assignment will be completed before the next iteration of the loop. As a result, the `acct_mem` array may not be fully initialized, leading to potential issues with the code's correctness.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a blocking assignment (`=`) instead of a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) in the for loop. Additionally, the code should ensure that the loop is executed atomically to prevent interruptions. This can be achieved by using a blocking assignment and ensuring that the loop is not interrupted by other threads. For example
