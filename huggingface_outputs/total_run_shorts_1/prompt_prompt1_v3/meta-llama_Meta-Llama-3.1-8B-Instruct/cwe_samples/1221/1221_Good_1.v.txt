 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet does not contain any known vulnerabilities. It appears to be a simple parameter and local parameter declaration.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a simple parameter and local parameter declaration. It does not contain any code that could potentially introduce a vulnerability. The parameter `MEM_SIZE` is set to 100 and the local parameter `JTAG_OFFSET` is also set to 100. There are no function calls, conditional statements, or other code that could introduce a vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a simple and harmless declaration of parameters.  The code is well-formed and does not contain any syntax errors.  However, it may be worth noting that the values of `MEM_SIZE` and `JTAG_OFFSET` are hardcoded, which may limit the flexibility of the code. If the values of these parameters need to be changed in the future, it may be better to use a more dynamic approach, such as using a configuration file or a command-line argument.  But this is not a vulnerability, and the code is still secure.
