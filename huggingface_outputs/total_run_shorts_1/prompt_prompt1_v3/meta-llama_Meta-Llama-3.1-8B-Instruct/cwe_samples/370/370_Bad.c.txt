VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns a pointer to an X509 structure, which can be null if the peer does not present a certificate. The code does not check for this possibility before attempting to use the certificate.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet attempts to retrieve the peer's certificate using SSL_get_peer_certificate. However, it does not check if the function returns a null pointer before attempting to use the certificate. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the peer does not present a certificate. The code then attempts to verify the certificate using SSL_get_verify_result, but it does this twice. The second call to SSL_get_verify_result is unnecessary and can be removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the SSL_get_peer_certificate function returns a null pointer before attempting to use the certificate. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the pointer is null. The unnecessary call to SSL_get_verify_result can also be removed. Here is an example of how the corrected code could look: if (cert =
