VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a predictable nonce. The SHA-1 hash of the nonce is used to derive the password, which can be used to determine the timing of the hash computation.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a predictable nonce, which is the string "bad nonce". This nonce is then hashed using SHA-1, and the resulting digest is used to derive the password. The password is then hashed again using SHA-1, and the resulting digest is used to send the command. The use of a predictable nonce makes it possible for an attacker to determine the timing of the hash computation, which can be used to launch a timing attack. This is a significant vulnerability, as it can allow an attacker to determine the password used to derive the digest.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a random nonce. The nonce should be hashed using a cryptographically secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, and the resulting digest should be used to derive the password. Additionally, the
