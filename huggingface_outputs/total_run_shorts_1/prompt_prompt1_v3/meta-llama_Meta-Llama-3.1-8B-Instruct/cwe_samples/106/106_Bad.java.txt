VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack due to the use of the `org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm` class, which is known to be vulnerable to a RCE attack when used with unvalidated user input.
EXPLANATION: The `ActionForm` class in Struts 1.x is vulnerable to RCE attacks when used with unvalidated user input. This is because the class does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. In this code snippet, the `RegistrationForm` class extends the `ActionForm` class, which means it inherits this vulnerability. To fix this issue, the code should be migrated to a newer version of Struts or the vulnerable class should be replaced with a more secure alternative.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Migrate to a newer version of Struts (e.g., Struts 2.x) or replace the `ActionForm` class with a more secure alternative, such as a custom form class that properly sanitizes user input. Additionally, ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized throughout the application.  The use of the `private` keyword in
