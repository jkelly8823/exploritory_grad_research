VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack due to the use of the eval() function on user input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
EXPLANATION: The eval() function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string. In this case, the user input is passed directly to eval() without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could exploit this by entering a string that contains malicious code, such as a system call or a function call that can be used to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer method to parse the user input, such as the ast module or a library like numexpr. Alternatively, the code could use a simple split() function to separate the input string into individual numbers, and then use a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur during the parsing process. Additionally, the code should validate the input to ensure that it only contains numbers and spaces, and reject any input that contains malicious characters.
