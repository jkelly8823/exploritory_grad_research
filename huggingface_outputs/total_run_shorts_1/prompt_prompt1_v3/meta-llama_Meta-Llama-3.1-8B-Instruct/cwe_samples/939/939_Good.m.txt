VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a URL scheme spoofing attack. An attacker could potentially replace the "replaceFileText" parameter with a malicious URL scheme, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
EXPLANATION: The code is using a hardcoded URL scheme, which can be exploited by an attacker. The "replaceFileText" parameter is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This is a classic example of a URL scheme spoofing attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the URL scheme and parameters before opening the URL. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed URL schemes and parameters, and checking if the provided URL matches this whitelist. Additionally, the code should handle any errors that occur when opening the URL, to prevent crashes or other unexpected behavior. For example, the code could use a library like NSHipster's URLValidator to validate the URL. 

Note: The code is also vulnerable to a potential crash if the URL is invalid or cannot be opened. However, this is a separate issue and not directly related to the URL scheme spoofing attack
