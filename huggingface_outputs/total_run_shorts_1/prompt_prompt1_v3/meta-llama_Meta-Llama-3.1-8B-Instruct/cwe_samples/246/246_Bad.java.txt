VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a remote code execution attack due to the creation of a socket to a remote server. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code or data into the server.
EXPLANATION: The creation of a socket to a remote server allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code or data into the server. This is a serious vulnerability as it can lead to remote code execution attacks. The code does not perform any validation on the remote server's hostname or IP address, making it susceptible to DNS spoofing or IP spoofing attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to validate the remote server's hostname or IP address before creating the socket. This can be done by using a library such as DNSJava to perform DNS lookups and validate the hostname. Additionally, the code should be modified to use a secure protocol such as HTTPS to communicate with the remote server. The code should also be modified to handle exceptions and errors properly to prevent potential security issues.  The code should also be modified to use a secure way to create the socket, such as using a SocketFactory.  The code should also be
