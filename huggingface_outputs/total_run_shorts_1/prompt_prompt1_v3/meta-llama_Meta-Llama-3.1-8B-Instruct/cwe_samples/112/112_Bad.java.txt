VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: DOM-based XSS vulnerability due to the use of DocumentBuilderFactory without proper configuration.
EXPLANATION: The DocumentBuilderFactory is used to parse XML files, but it is not configured to prevent external entity expansion, which can lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This is because the 'factory.setValidating(false)' method is used to disable XML validation, making the parser vulnerable to external entity expansion attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should configure the DocumentBuilderFactory to prevent external entity expansion by setting the 'factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true)' method and 'factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false)' method. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to parse XML files, such as using a streaming parser.
