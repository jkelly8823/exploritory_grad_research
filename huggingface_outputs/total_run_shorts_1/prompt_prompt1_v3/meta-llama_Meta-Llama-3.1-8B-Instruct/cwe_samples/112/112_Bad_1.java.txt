VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability is present due to the potential for XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This occurs because the DocumentBuilderFactory is not configured to prevent external entity expansion.
EXPLANATION: 
The DocumentBuilderFactory is used to parse XML documents. By default, it is configured to allow external entity expansion, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or data. This is a serious vulnerability, as it can be used to extract sensitive data or even execute arbitrary code. To prevent this, the DocumentBuilderFactory must be configured to prevent external entity expansion by setting the feature "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" to false and the feature "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, you can configure the DocumentBuilderFactory as follows:
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
builderFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);
builderFactory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
builderFactory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
DocumentBuilder builder =
