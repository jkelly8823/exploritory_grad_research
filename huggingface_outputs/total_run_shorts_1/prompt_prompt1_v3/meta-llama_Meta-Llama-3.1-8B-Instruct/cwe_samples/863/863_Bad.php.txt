VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a cookie poisoning attack. This is because the code directly uses user input from the $_COOKIES array without any validation or sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code directly uses the value of $_COOKIES['role'] without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the 'role' cookie and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system. Additionally, the code uses the value of $_POST['patient_ID'] without any validation or sanitization, which could also lead to a SQL injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should be modified to validate and sanitize the values of $_COOKIES['role'] and $_POST['patient_ID'] before using them. This can be done by using a whitelist approach to validate the input and by using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, the code could use the following validation: if (!in_array($_COOKIES['role'], array('user', 'Reader', 'Admin'))) { die("Invalid role"); } and the following prepared statement: $stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM medical_history WHERE
