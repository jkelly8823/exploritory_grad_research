VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the strcpy function. The size of the buffer is fixed at 24 characters, but the strcpy function does not check the length of the input string.
EXPLANATION: The strcpy function copies the input string to the destination buffer without checking its length. If the input string is longer than the buffer size, it will overflow the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a safer function like strncpy or strcpy_s, which allows for a maximum number of characters to be copied. Alternatively, use a function that dynamically allocates memory based on the length of the input string. For example: char *buf = malloc(strlen(string) + 1); strcpy(buf, string); . Also, consider using a library that provides safer string functions, such as the "strings" library in C. Additionally, it is recommended to check the input string for potential buffer overflow attacks using a function like strlcpy.  Use of a library like "strings" can also help prevent such issues.
