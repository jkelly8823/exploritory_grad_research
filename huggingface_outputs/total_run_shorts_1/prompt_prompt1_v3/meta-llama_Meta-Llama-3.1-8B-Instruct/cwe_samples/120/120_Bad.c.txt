VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. This is because the scanf function is used to read user input into a fixed-size buffer (last_name), which can potentially be larger than the buffer size. An attacker could enter a string longer than 20 characters, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The scanf function does not perform any bounds checking on the input string, so it is possible for the user to enter a string longer than the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The use of scanf is also generally discouraged in favor of safer input functions like fgets or getline.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer input function like fgets or getline to read the user's last name. These functions allow for more control over the input buffer size and can help prevent buffer overflow attacks. For example, you could use the following code to read the user's last name: fgets(last_name, 20, stdin); This will read a line of input up to 19 characters (leaving room for the null terminator), and prevent a buffer overflow
