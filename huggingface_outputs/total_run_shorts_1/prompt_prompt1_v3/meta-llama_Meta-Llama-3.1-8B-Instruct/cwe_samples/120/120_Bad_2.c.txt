VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability in gets() function. The gets() function does not perform bounds checking on the input and can read past the end of the buffer, potentially allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code or data into the program.
EXPLANATION: The gets() function is a vulnerable function that can be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary code or data into the program. This is because it does not perform any bounds checking on the input, and will continue to read input until it encounters a newline character. This can lead to a buffer overflow, where the input data overflows the buffer and potentially corrupts adjacent memory locations. The gets() function is a known security risk and should be avoided in favor of safer functions like fgets() or gets_s().
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the gets() function with a safer function like fgets() or gets_s(). Ensure that the buffer size is properly set and that the input is properly validated to prevent buffer overflows. For example: fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin); will read at most sizeof(buf) - 1 characters from the input stream and store them in buf, leaving space for the null terminator. This will prevent
