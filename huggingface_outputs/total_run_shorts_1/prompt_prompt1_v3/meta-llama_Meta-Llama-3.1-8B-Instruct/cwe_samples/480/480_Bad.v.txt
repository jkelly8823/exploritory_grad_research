VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition in the debug mode logic. The debug mode is updated based on the current privilege level, but the privilege level is also updated based on the debug mode. This creates a potential race condition where the debug mode is updated before the privilege level is updated, or vice versa.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the `priv_lvl_o` is assigned a value based on the current `debug_mode_q` and `umode_i`, but the `debug_mode_q` is updated based on the current `priv_lvl_o`. This creates a feedback loop where the `debug_mode_q` and `priv_lvl_o` are updated in a way that can cause a race condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to ensure that the `priv_lvl_o` is updated before the `debug_mode_q` is updated. This can be achieved by introducing a small delay between the update of `priv_lvl_o` and the update of `debug_mode_q`. Alternatively, the code can be restructured to avoid the feedback loop altogether. For example, the `priv
