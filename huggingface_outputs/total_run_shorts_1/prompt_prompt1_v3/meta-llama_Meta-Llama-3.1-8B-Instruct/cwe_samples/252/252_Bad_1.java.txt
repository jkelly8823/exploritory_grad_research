 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The itemName variable is directly used in a comparison operation without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious input.
EXPLANATION: The itemName variable is obtained from the request parameter, which can be manipulated by an attacker. If the attacker provides a specially crafted input, they can cause the comparison operation to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a SQL injection attack. This is a classic example of a vulnerability that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the itemName variable should be properly sanitized and validated before using it in the comparison operation. This can be achieved by using a whitelist approach, where only expected input values are allowed, or by using a library that provides input validation and sanitization. Additionally, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should be modified to use a secure method to retrieve and compare the itemName variable. For example, using a switch statement or a Map to store expected values and their corresponding actions. 

Note: The ITEM_NAME and IMPORTANT_ITEM are assumed to be constants
