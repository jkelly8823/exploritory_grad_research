VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The itemName variable is directly used in a comparison without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
EXPLANATION: The itemName variable is directly obtained from the request object without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input and inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the itemName variable should be properly sanitized and validated before using it in the comparison. This can be achieved by using a parameterized query or a prepared statement, or by using a library that provides input validation and sanitization. For example, you can use the String.Equals method with the StringComparison parameter set to StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase to make the comparison case-insensitive. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input and ensure it only contains expected characters.
