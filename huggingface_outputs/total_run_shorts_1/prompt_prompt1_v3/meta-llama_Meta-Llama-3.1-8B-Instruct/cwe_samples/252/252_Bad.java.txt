VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 8, 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a file path traversal attack. An attacker could potentially manipulate the 'userName' variable to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a user-provided input 'userName' to construct a file path. This input is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory. The use of a FileInputStream to read the file also makes it vulnerable to a denial of service attack if the file is large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to construct the file path, such as using a Path object and checking the file's existence and permissions before attempting to read it. Additionally, the code should handle potential exceptions that may occur when reading the file, such as IOException. The use of a try-with-resources statement can help ensure that the FileInputStream is properly closed. For example: Path filePath = Paths.get(PFILE_ROOT, userName); Files.exists(filePath); Files.isReadable(filePath); try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filePath.toFile())) { fis.read(byteArray); } catch (
