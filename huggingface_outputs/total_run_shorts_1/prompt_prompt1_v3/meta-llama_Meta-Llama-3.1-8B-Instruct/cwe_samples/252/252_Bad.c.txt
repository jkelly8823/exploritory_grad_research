 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The fgets function reads at most 9 characters from stdin, but the strcpy function copies the entire contents of buf into cp_buf, which has a size of 10. This means that if the user enters more than 9 characters, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a security breach.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the fgets function does not null-terminate the string if the input is exactly 9 characters long. This means that when the strcpy function is called, it will copy the entire contents of buf into cp_buf, including the newline character that fgets leaves in the buffer. If the user enters more than 9 characters, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer function like strncpy to copy the contents of buf into cp_buf, and make sure to null-terminate the string. For example: strncpy(cp_buf, buf, 10); cp_buf[9] = '\0';. This will prevent the buffer overflow and ensure that the string is properly null-terminated. Alternatively, you
