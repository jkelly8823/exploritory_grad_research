VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The `System.clearProperty()` method is used to clear the "os.name" property, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the system's identification. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the system is unable to identify itself correctly.
EXPLANATION: The `System.clearProperty()` method is used to clear the "os.name" property, which is a system property that identifies the operating system. By clearing this property, an attacker can manipulate the system's identification, leading to a potential denial-of-service attack. This is a security vulnerability because it allows an attacker to disrupt the normal functioning of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `System.clearProperty()` method should not be used to clear the "os.name" property. Instead, the property should be checked for its value before using it. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where the "os.name" property is not set correctly. This can be done by using a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when trying to access the
