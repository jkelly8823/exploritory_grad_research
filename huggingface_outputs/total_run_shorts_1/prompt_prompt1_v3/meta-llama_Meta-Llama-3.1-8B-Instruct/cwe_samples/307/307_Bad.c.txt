VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of fixed-size buffers for storing usernames and passwords. An attacker could potentially send a username or password that is longer than the buffer size, causing the program to write beyond the bounds of the buffer and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The code uses fixed-size buffers for storing usernames and passwords, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause a buffer overflow. The `getNextMessage` function is used to read data from the socket, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the data. If the data is longer than the buffer size, it will be truncated, but the buffer will still be overwritten, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use dynamic memory allocation to store the usernames and passwords, and perform bounds checking on the data read from the socket. This can be achieved by using functions like `malloc` and `strncpy` to allocate and copy the data, and checking the return values of these functions to ensure that the data was copied successfully. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to
