VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present due to the direct use of user input in the authentication process without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet directly assigns user input from the $_POST array to variables without any validation or sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database. Additionally, the use of user input in the authentication process without proper validation makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code to steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate and sanitize user input using techniques such as prepared statements or parameterized queries for SQL injection protection, and HTML escaping for XSS protection. The code should also be updated to use a secure authentication mechanism, such as password hashing and salting, to protect user credentials. Specifically, the code should be modified to use a library like PDO or MySQLi to execute SQL queries with prepared statements, and to use a function like htmlspecialchars() to escape user input before displaying it.
