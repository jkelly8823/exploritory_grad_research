VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet provided is a form validation template, which is a common use case in web development. It defines a form with several fields, each with its own validation rules. The validation rules are defined using the `depends` attribute, which specifies the conditions under which the field is valid. The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code snippet is well-structured and follows best practices for form validation. However, it's always a good idea to review the code and ensure that the validation rules are correct and comprehensive. Additionally, consider using a more robust validation library or framework to handle complex validation scenarios.  ```python
import re

def validate_phone_number(phone_number):
    pattern = r'^([0-9]{3})(-)([0-9]{4}|[0-9]{4})$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, phone_number))

def validate_zipcode(zipcode):
    pattern = r'^\d{5}$'
    return
