VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function createOutputDirectory is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. This is because the function does not properly sanitize the input parameter name. An attacker could potentially manipulate the name parameter to traverse the directory tree and access sensitive files.
EXPLANATION: The function createOutputDirectory takes a parameter name which is appended to the output directory path. However, the function does not validate or sanitize the input parameter name. This allows an attacker to manipulate the name parameter to traverse the directory tree and access sensitive files. For example, if the current directory is /home/user and the name parameter is../sensitive, the function will create the directory /home/../sensitive which is equivalent to /sensitive. This is a classic example of a directory traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should validate and sanitize the input parameter name. This can be done by using a whitelist approach where only certain characters are allowed in the name parameter. Alternatively, the function can use a library function that properly sanitizes the input parameter. Additionally, the function should also check for any directory traversal characters such as.. and / in the name parameter. If any of
