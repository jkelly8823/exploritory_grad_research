 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 21
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a race condition in the always block. When the ip_resetn signal is low, the Data_out and Write_once_status are reset to their initial values. However, when the write signal is asserted and the Write_once_status is low, the Data_out is updated with the masked Data_in value. If the ip_resetn signal goes high before the write signal is asserted, the Data_out will be updated with the masked Data_in value before it is reset to its initial value. This can lead to an inconsistent state of the Data_out register.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the fact that the always block is triggered by the Clk signal and the negedge of the ip_resetn signal. When the ip_resetn signal is low, the Data_out and Write_once_status are reset to their initial values. However, when the write signal is asserted and the Write_once_status is low, the Data_out is updated with the masked Data_in value. If the ip_resetn signal goes high before the write signal is asserted, the Data_out will be updated with the masked Data_in value before it is reset to its initial value. This can lead
