VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A memory leak is possible due to the lack of a corresponding free() call for the allocated memory.
EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory using malloc() but does not provide a corresponding free() call to release the memory when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak if the allocated memory is not properly deallocated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a corresponding free() call to release the allocated memory when it is no longer needed. For example: free(foo);. This will ensure that the memory is properly deallocated and prevent a memory leak.  ```c
free(foo);
