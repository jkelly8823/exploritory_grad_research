VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code has a race condition vulnerability in the data_out register. The issue arises from the fact that the data_out register is updated in two different paths, and one of these paths does not check the lock_status before updating the register.
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses two always blocks to update the data_out register. The first block resets the data_out register when the reset signal is asserted. The second block updates the data_out register when the write signal is asserted and the lock_status is not asserted, or when the scan_mode or debug_unlocked signals are asserted. However, the second block also updates the data_out register when the write signal is not asserted, which can cause a race condition. This is because the data_out register is updated without checking the lock_status, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Merge the two always
