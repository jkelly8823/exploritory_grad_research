VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack due to the use of the getpwnam function, which can be manipulated by an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The getpwnam function is used to retrieve information about a user, but it can be tricked into returning information about a non-existent user, allowing an attacker to access sensitive files on the system. This is a classic example of a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The isTrustedGroup function is also vulnerable to similar attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more secure method of retrieving user information, such as the getpwuid function, which is less susceptible to LFI attacks. Additionally, the isTrustedGroup function should be reviewed and modified to prevent similar attacks. The code should also be audited to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized and validated.  The allow() and deny() functions should be reviewed to ensure they are not vulnerable to other types of attacks.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that it is not
