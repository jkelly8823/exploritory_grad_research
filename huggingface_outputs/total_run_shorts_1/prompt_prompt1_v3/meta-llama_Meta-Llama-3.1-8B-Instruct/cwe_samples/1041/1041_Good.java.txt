VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a simple implementation of a surface area calculation for a cylinder. The `ComplexMath` method calculates the surface area using the formula `pi * r * s + pi * r^2`. However, there are a few potential issues with the code. Firstly, the `Math.PI` constant is being used directly in the calculation, which may lead to precision issues due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in memory. Secondly, the `ComplexMath` method is not handling the case where `r` or `s` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error. Finally, the `main` method is calling the `ComplexMath` method twice with the same arguments, which is unnecessary and could be optimized.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider using a more precise method for calculating pi, such as the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula.
2. Add a check to handle the case where `r` or `s` is zero in the `ComplexMath` method.
3. Remove the duplicate call to the
