VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function readFile is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the function uses the fileowner function to check if the file is owned by the current user, but it does not properly sanitize the filename. An attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the function uses the fileowner function to check if the file is owned by the current user, but it does not properly sanitize the filename. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, if the filename is set to '../secret.txt', the function would resolve the symbolic link and then check if the file is owned by the current user. If the file is owned by the current user, the function would return the contents of the file. However, if the file is not owned by the current user, the function would return 'Access denied'. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to properly sanitize the filename. This can be done by using the realpath function to ensure that the
