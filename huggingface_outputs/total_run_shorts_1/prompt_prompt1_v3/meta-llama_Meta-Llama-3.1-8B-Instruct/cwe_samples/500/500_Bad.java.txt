VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. This is because the appPropertiesFile variable is set to a string that is user-controlled and contains a path to a file. An attacker could potentially manipulate this path to access sensitive files on the system.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the appPropertiesFile variable is set to a string that is user-controlled. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate this path to access sensitive files on the system. For example, if the attacker were to set the appPropertiesFile variable to "/etc/passwd", the application would attempt to read the contents of the /etc/passwd file, potentially revealing sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the application should validate the path to the appPropertiesFile before attempting to read it. This could be done by using a library such as Apache Commons IO to validate the path. Additionally, the application should ensure that the path is within a trusted directory, such as the application's own directory. Finally, the application should consider using a more secure method of loading properties files, such as using a properties file loader that is designed to prevent path traversal attacks
