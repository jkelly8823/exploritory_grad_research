 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple class definition with a static final variable declaration. There are no potential security risks or vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. It appears to be a clean and secure piece of code.  The variable declaration is properly scoped and the value is a string literal, which is not a potential security risk.  The variable is also declared as final, which means it cannot be changed once it is initialized.  This is a good practice to prevent unexpected behavior.  However, it is worth noting that the variable is declared as public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere.  This is not necessarily a security risk, but it may be worth considering making the variable private if it is not intended to be accessed from outside the class.  However, this is not a vulnerability and is simply a matter of coding style.  Overall, the code snippet appears to be secure and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.  It is a good practice to follow the principle of least privilege and only
