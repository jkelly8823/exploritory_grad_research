 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple class definition with a static constant variable. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None. The code appears to be secure.  The static constant variable is properly defined and does not pose any security risks.  However, it is worth noting that the variable is not being used in the provided code snippet, so its purpose is unclear.  It may be worth reviewing the code in the context of the larger project to ensure it is being used correctly.  Additionally, it may be worth considering using a more secure method of storing configuration data, such as environment variables or a secure configuration file.  However, these are not vulnerabilities in the code snippet itself.  They are potential security considerations that may be worth exploring further.  The code snippet is secure as presented.  It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.  It is worth noting that the code snippet is missing a closing bracket at the end of the class definition.  This may be a copy-paste error and is not a security vulnerability.
