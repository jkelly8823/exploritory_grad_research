 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack due to the use of user input in the SQL query without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The code is using user input from the AskForUserName() and AskForPassword() functions to construct a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input. For example, if the user enters a string like "Robert'); DROP TABLE users; --", the SQL query would be executed as "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'Robert'); DROP TABLE users; --' AND password = 'password'" which would result in the users table being dropped.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the user input from the SQL query. This can be achieved by using a library like PDO or MySQLi. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize the user input to prevent any malicious characters from being injected into the SQL query. For example, the code could use a whitelist approach to only allow certain characters in the username and password fields. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is not SQL injection, but rather a command injection vulnerability
