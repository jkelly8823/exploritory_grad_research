 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The variable price is declared as private, but the changePrice method is public. This allows any class to modify the price of this object, potentially leading to unintended behavior.
EXPLANATION: The private access modifier is intended to restrict access to the variable price. However, the public changePrice method allows any class to modify the price, bypassing the intended access restriction. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the class is used in a multi-threaded environment.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the changePrice method should be declared as private, matching the access modifier of the price variable. This will ensure that only the class itself can modify the price, maintaining the intended access restriction. Alternatively, the price variable could be declared as public, but this would defeat the purpose of encapsulation and potentially lead to other issues. ```private: float price;public: void changePrice(float newPrice) {price = newPrice;}``` should be changed to ```private: float price;private: void changePrice(float newPrice) {price = newPrice;}```.```
