 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (==) in the if statement.
EXPLANATION: The line "if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {" is attempting to assign the result of SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) to the variable cert, rather than comparing the two. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the result of SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) is larger than the size of cert, potentially causing undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the assignment operator (=) with the comparison operator (==) in the if statement, like so: "if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {" to prevent the potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Additionally, consider checking the return value of SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) to ensure it is not NULL before attempting to use it.  ```c
if (cert!= NULL && cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got a certificate, do secret things
}
``` ```  ``` ```c
``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ``` ```
