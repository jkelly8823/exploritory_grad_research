 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential null pointer dereference. This is because the SSL_get_peer function returns a pointer to the peer's certificate, but it does not check if the pointer is null before dereferencing it. If the pointer is null, the code will attempt to access memory at address 0, leading to a segmentation fault.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises from the line where the code checks if the cert is equal to the result of SSL_get_peer. The SSL_get_peer function returns a pointer to the peer's certificate, but it does not check if the pointer is null before returning it. If the SSL_get_peer function returns a null pointer, the code will attempt to dereference it, leading to a null pointer dereference. This is a serious vulnerability because it can be exploited by an attacker to crash the program or potentially execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the result of SSL_get_peer is null before attempting to dereference it. This can be done by adding a simple null check before the if statement. For example: if (cert!= NULL && cert = SSL_get
