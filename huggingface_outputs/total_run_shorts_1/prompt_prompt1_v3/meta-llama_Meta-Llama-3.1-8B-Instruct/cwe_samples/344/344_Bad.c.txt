VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to a potential buffer overflow in the `VerifyAdmin` function. The `strcmp` function is used to compare the input password with a hardcoded string, but it does not check for buffer overflows. If the input password is longer than the hardcoded string, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
EXPLANATION: The `strcmp` function is vulnerable to buffer overflows because it does not perform any bounds checking on the input strings. If the input password is longer than the hardcoded string, it can cause the `strcmp` function to write beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a safer string comparison function, such as `strncmp`, which performs bounds checking on the input strings. Additionally, the hardcoded password should be replaced with a secure password storage mechanism, such as a hash of the password. The code should also be modified to handle errors and exceptions properly, to prevent potential crashes or security vulnerabilities. For example
