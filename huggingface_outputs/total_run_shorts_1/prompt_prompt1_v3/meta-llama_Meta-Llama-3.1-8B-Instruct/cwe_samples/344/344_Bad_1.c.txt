VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to code injection attacks. The function pointer `pt2Function` is assigned a hardcoded memory address `0x08040000` which can be exploited to inject malicious code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a function pointer `pt2Function` which is assigned a hardcoded memory address `0x08040000`. This is a potential entry point for code injection attacks. An attacker can manipulate the memory address to point to malicious code, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function pointer should be assigned a valid function address instead of a hardcoded memory address. The function address should be obtained through a secure method, such as using a function pointer to a known function. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it does not allow for arbitrary code execution. It is also recommended to use a secure coding practice, such as using a whitelist of allowed functions, to prevent code injection attacks.  The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not allow for arbitrary code execution.  The use of a function pointer with a hardcoded memory address is a significant security
