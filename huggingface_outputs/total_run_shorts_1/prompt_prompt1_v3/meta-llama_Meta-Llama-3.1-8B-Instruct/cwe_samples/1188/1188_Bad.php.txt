VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the direct execution of user-provided input in the login_user() function without proper sanitization or parameterization.
EXPLANATION: The login_user() function is likely a database query that executes a SQL statement using the provided $user and $pass variables. However, without proper sanitization or parameterization, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the $user and $pass variables. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database or other security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the login_user() function should be modified to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be achieved by using a library like PDO or mysqli, which provide a safe way to execute SQL queries with user-provided input. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all user-provided input is properly sanitized before being used in database queries. 

Note: The actual vulnerability is in the login_user() function, not the code snippet provided. The code snippet provided is just a trigger for the vulnerability.
