VULNERABLE_LINES: 2,3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the user input is not sanitized and is directly used to construct a file path.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `GetUntrustedInput` function to retrieve user input, which is then used to construct a file path. The `s/\.\.\///` regular expression is used to remove any `..` sequences from the input, but this is not sufficient to prevent path traversal attacks. An attacker could still provide a path like `/home/user/../etc/passwd` to access files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a whitelist approach to validate the user input. This can be done by checking if the input matches a specific pattern, such as a valid username. Additionally, the code should use a function like `Path::Class` to safely construct the file path. The `ReadAndSendFile` function should also be reviewed to ensure it does not have any other vulnerabilities. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not have any other vulnerabilities
