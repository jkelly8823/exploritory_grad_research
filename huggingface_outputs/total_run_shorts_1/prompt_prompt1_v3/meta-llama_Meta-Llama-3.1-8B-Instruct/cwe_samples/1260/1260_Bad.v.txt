VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code defines several large constant values as local parameters. This could potentially cause issues with memory usage or code size, especially in embedded systems where resources are limited. However, the more significant issue here is the potential for integer overflow when performing arithmetic operations on these large values.
EXPLANATION: The code defines several large constant values as local parameters, including PLICLength, UARTLength, AESLength, and SPILength. These values are all 64-bit integers, but they are being defined as local parameters, which could potentially cause issues with memory usage or code size. More importantly, when performing arithmetic operations on these large values, there is a potential for integer overflow. This is because the values are so large that they could exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit integer. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, consider defining these large constant values as parameters or constants at the top level of the design, rather than as local parameters. This would help to reduce memory usage and code size. Additionally, consider using a library or module that provides support for arbitrary-precision
