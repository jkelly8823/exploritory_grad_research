VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Division by Zero vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to divide by zero, which is undefined in mathematics and can cause a program to crash or produce unexpected results. This is a common security vulnerability, especially in web applications where user input can be used to manipulate the code. The division operation is attempted on line 9, which is the line where the vulnerability is located.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Always validate user input to prevent malicious users from manipulating the code.
- Use a safe division method, such as BigDecimal or a library that can handle division by zero without throwing an exception.
- Consider using a try-catch block to catch the ArithmeticException and handle it in a way that makes sense for your application. However, this is not recommended as it can mask other bugs and make debugging more difficult.  The best practice is to avoid the division by zero in the first place.  Consider adding a check to ensure that b is not zero before attempting the division. 
- Use a linter or code analysis tool to catch division by zero vulnerabilities in your code.  This can help prevent these types of vulnerabilities from making it into production.
