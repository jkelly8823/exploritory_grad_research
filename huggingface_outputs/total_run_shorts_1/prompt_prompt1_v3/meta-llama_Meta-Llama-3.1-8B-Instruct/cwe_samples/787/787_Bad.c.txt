VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to writing beyond the bounds of the id_sequence array.
EXPLANATION: The id_sequence array is declared with a size of 3, but the code attempts to write 4 elements to it. This can cause the program to write beyond the bounds of the array, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and leading to undefined behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Increase the size of the id_sequence array to accommodate the 4 elements being written to it, or use a dynamically allocated array to ensure the correct amount of memory is allocated. Alternatively, use a data structure such as a vector or list that can automatically resize as needed.  Ensure that the bounds of the array are checked before writing to it to prevent buffer overflows.  Consider using a safer alternative to C-style arrays, such as std::array or std::vector.
