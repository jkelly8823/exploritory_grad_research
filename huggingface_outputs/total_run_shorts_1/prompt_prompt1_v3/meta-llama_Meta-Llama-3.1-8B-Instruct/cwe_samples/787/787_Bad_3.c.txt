VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this function. The function allocates a buffer of size 4*MAX_SIZE, but does not check if the allocated buffer is large enough to hold the encoded string. If the user-supplied string is very long, it can cause the buffer to overflow, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The function allocates a buffer of size 4*MAX_SIZE, but does not check if the allocated buffer is large enough to hold the encoded string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the user-supplied string is very long. The function also uses a fixed-size buffer, which can be a problem if the user-supplied string is very large. The function should use a dynamically allocated buffer that is large enough to hold the encoded string.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The function should be modified to dynamically allocate a buffer that is large enough to hold the encoded string. This can be done by using the strlen function to get the length of the user-supplied string and then allocating a buffer of that size. The function should also check if the allocated buffer is large enough to hold the encoded string before copying
