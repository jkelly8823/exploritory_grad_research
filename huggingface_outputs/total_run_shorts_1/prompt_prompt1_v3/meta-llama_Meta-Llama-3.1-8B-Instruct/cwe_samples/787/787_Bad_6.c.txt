VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of strcpy() on a string that may be larger than the remaining space in the destination buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses the strstr() function to find the position of the string "Replace Me" in the destination buffer destBuf. However, it does not check if the remaining space in the buffer is sufficient to hold the source string srcBuf. If the source string is larger than the remaining space, the strcpy() function will write beyond the bounds of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can result in arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer string function like strncpy() or strncat() that allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy. Alternatively, you can use a buffer size check to ensure that the remaining space in the buffer is sufficient before copying the source string. Additionally, consider using a more secure function like snprintf() to prevent buffer overflows.  ```c
strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, sizeof(destBuf) - idx);``` or ```snprintf(&
