VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect calculation of the destination buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The function `returnChunkSize` is supposed to return the size of usable memory in the chunk. However, in the `main` function, the size is calculated as `returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1`, which is incorrect. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the returned size is 1, causing the `memcpy` function to write one byte beyond the end of the destination buffer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The correct calculation should be `returnChunkSize(destBuf)`, without subtracting 1. Additionally, it's recommended to add error checking to ensure that the returned size is valid before using it in the `memcpy` function. This can be done by checking if the returned size is greater than 0 before the copy operation. For example: `if (returnChunkSize(destBuf) > 0) { memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, returnChunkSize(destBuf)); }`. This will prevent the buffer overflow and ensure that the copy operation is performed safely.
