VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11, 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of string concatenation to build the interest rate string. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input to the getInterestRate method.
EXPLANATION: The getInterestRate method uses a switch statement to determine which interest rate to return based on the input points. However, the interest rates are hardcoded as strings, which can lead to a potential SQL injection attack. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input to the getInterestRate method. For example, if an attacker passes in a points value of 0, the method will return the interest rate for 0 points, which is hardcoded as "5.00". However, if an attacker passes in a points value of 1, the method will return the interest rate for 1 point, which is hardcoded as "4.75". This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the interest rates should be stored in a secure manner, such as using a database or a secure configuration file. The get
