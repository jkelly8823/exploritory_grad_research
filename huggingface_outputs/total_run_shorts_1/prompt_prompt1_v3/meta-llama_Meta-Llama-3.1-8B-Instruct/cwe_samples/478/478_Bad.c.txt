 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack due to the use of a switch statement with a variable that is assigned a value from a function call (security_check(data)). If the function call returns an unexpected value, it could cause the switch statement to jump to an unintended case, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other security issues.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the switch statement is using a variable (result) that is assigned a value from a function call (security_check(data)). This function call could potentially return an unexpected value, causing the switch statement to jump to an unintended case. In this case, the switch statement is using the value of result to determine which case to execute, but it is not validating the value of result before using it. This makes it vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate the value of result before using it in the switch statement. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that result is within the expected range of values. Additionally, the code should consider using a safer alternative to the switch statement, such as a series
