VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential exception when handling the match case for result == 1. If process_data(data) returns a value other than 0 or 1, the match case will fail and an exception will be raised.
EXPLANATION: The match case statement is used to handle different values of result. However, the match case statement only handles values 0 and 1. If process_data(data) returns any other value, the match case will fail and an exception will be raised. This is because the match case statement does not handle the default case, which would be any value other than 0 or 1.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a default case to the match statement to handle any value other than 0 or 1. This can be done by adding a match case for the default value, which is typically represented by the underscore character (_). For example: match result: case 0: print("Properly handle zero case.") case 1: print("Properly handle one case.") case _: print("Properly handle default case.") This will ensure that
