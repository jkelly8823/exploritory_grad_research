 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential case of "switch fallthrough" where if the switch statement has a case that is not explicitly handled, the program will continue to execute the next case.
EXPLANATION: The switch statement in this code snippet does not handle all possible cases. If the sum of input1 and input2 is greater than 3, the program will continue to execute the next case, which could lead to unexpected behavior. This is a classic example of a switch fallthrough vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the developer should add a default case to the switch statement to handle any unexpected values. For example: `default: alert("Unexpected value"); break;` This will ensure that the program handles all possible cases and prevents the switch fallthrough vulnerability. Additionally, the developer should consider adding input validation to ensure that input1 and input2 are within the expected range.
