 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-16, 20-22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the use of `System.err.println` statements in the `default` case of the `switch` statement. This can lead to a resource-intensive process that consumes system resources and potentially crashes the application.
EXPLANATION: The `System.err.println` statements in the `default` case can cause the application to consume excessive system resources, leading to a potential DoS attack. This is because the `println` method is not thread-safe and can lead to a deadlock situation if multiple threads are accessing the same resource. Additionally, the `System.err.println` statements can also lead to a resource leak if not properly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the `System.err.println` statements with a more robust logging mechanism, such as a logging framework like Log4j or Logback. This will allow for more controlled and efficient logging, reducing the risk of a DoS attack. Additionally, consider using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as throwing an exception or returning a specific error code, to handle invalid input
