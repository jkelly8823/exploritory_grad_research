 

VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet appears to be a simple switch statement using the match-case syntax. It handles three possible cases: 0, 1, and any other value. The code is well-structured and does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is always a good practice to consider potential edge cases and handle them accordingly. In this case, the code already handles the unexpected condition, which is a good practice.  The code could be improved by adding more comments to explain the purpose of each case and the expected behavior.  Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider adding error handling for potential issues that may arise during the execution of the process_data function.  This could include checking for potential exceptions or errors that may be raised by the function.  However, these are minor suggestions and do not affect the overall security of the code.  The code is secure and well-structured.  It is a good example of how to use the match-case syntax to handle different cases in a clean and efficient way
