 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to the use of a non-blocking assignment (<=) in the always block. This can cause the state to be updated before the previous state is fully propagated, leading to unpredictable behavior.
EXPLANATION: In the always block, the state is updated using a non-blocking assignment (<=). This can cause the state to be updated before the previous state is fully propagated, leading to unpredictable behavior. This is particularly problematic in a finite state machine where the state is used to determine the next state.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a blocking assignment (=) instead of a non-blocking assignment (<=) to update the state. This will ensure that the state is fully propagated before the next state is determined. For example, replace the line `out <= {1'h1, state};` with `out = {1'h1, state};`. Additionally, consider using a blocking assignment to update the state in the always block, such as `state =...;` instead of `state <=...;`. This will ensure that the state is fully propagated before the next state is determined.
