VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential DOM-based XSS attack due to the use of the `alert` function to display user-controlled input.
EXPLANATION: The `alert` function is not a secure way to display user-controlled input, as it can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code. In this case, the `input1` and `input2` variables are being added together and used as a case value in the switch statement. If an attacker can manipulate the values of `input1` and `input2`, they can potentially inject malicious code that will be executed when the switch statement is evaluated. This is a classic example of a DOM-based XSS attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a secure method for displaying user-controlled input, such as a `console.log` statement or a secure templating engine. Additionally, the code should be validated to ensure that the values of `input1` and `input2` are not user-controlled. If they are, the code should be modified to sanitize the input before using it in the switch statement. For example: `let step = parseInt(input1
