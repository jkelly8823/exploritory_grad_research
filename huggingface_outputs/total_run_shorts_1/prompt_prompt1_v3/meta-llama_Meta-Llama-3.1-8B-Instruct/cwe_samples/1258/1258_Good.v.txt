VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is an information disclosure vulnerability. The code is leaking sensitive information (the key) to the debug mode input. This is a serious issue because it allows an attacker to obtain the encryption key, which can be used to decrypt encrypted data.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the fact that the key_reg0 and key_reg1 registers are being assigned to the core_key0 and core_key1 outputs based on the debug_mode_i input. This means that if debug_mode_i is high, the key is being exposed. This is a problem because it allows an attacker to obtain the encryption key, which can be used to decrypt encrypted data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the code should be modified to remove the debug_mode_i input from the key assignment. Instead, the key should be assigned based on a secure mechanism, such as a secure random number generator. Additionally, the debug_mode_i input should be removed from the code altogether, as it is not necessary for the functionality of the AES encryption. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that there are no other instances of sensitive information being leaked to the debug mode input
