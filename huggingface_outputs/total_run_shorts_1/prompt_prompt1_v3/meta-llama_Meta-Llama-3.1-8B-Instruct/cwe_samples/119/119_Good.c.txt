 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code does not properly handle the case where the array index is equal to the length of the array, which can cause an "Index out of bounds" error.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code checks if the index is greater than or equal to 0, but it does not check if the index is equal to the length of the array. This can cause an "Index out of bounds" error when trying to access the array at the index equal to the length of the array.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check if the index is strictly less than the length of the array, like so: if (index >= 0 && index < len). This will prevent the "Index out of bounds" error from occurring. Additionally, it would be a good practice to add a comment explaining the reasoning behind the change.  ```if (index >= 0 && index < len)``` should be changed to ```if (index >= 0 && index < len - 1)``` to prevent index out of bounds error.```
