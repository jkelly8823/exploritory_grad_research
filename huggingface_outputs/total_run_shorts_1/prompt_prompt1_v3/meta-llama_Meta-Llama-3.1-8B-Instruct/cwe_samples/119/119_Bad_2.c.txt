VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to untrusted input used to index an array.
EXPLANATION: The variable `index` is assigned the value from `GetUntrustedOffset()`, which is a function that presumably returns a user-controlled value. This value is then used to index the `items` array, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the value is outside the bounds of the array. In this case, the value is decremented by 1 before being used, which means that an index of 1 or greater will result in an out-of-bounds access.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The `GetUntrustedOffset()` function should be replaced with a function that returns a validated and sanitized value. Alternatively, the `items` array could be made larger to accommodate the potential index value. However, the most secure approach would be to use a bounds-checked indexing method, such as `items[index >= 0 && index < 4 ? index : 0]`. This would prevent the buffer overflow vulnerability by ensuring that the index is always within the valid range.  Additionally, error checking should be added to handle the case where `GetUntrustedOffset()`
