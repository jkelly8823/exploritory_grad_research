VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking when copying user input into a dynamically allocated buffer.
EXPLANATION: The code allocates a buffer of size MAX_SIZE * 4 but does not perform any bounds checking when copying user input into this buffer. If the user input is longer than MAX_SIZE, it will overflow the buffer and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other security issues. The use of strlen(user_supplied_string) to determine the buffer size is also problematic as it does not account for the possibility of the input string being null-terminated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a safer method to allocate the buffer, such as using a function that takes the maximum size as a parameter, and perform bounds checking when copying user input into the buffer. Consider using a library that provides safe string functions, such as strlcpy or strncpy, to avoid buffer overflows. Additionally, consider using a more secure way to handle user input, such as using a library that provides input sanitization and validation.  The code should be modified to handle the case where the input string is longer than MAX_SIZE by either truncating it or returning an error.
