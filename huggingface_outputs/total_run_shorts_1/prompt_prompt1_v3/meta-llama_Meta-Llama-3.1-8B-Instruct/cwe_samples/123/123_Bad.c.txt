VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists because the size of the destination buffer is not checked before copying data into it. This can lead to writing past the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and causing undefined behavior.
EXPLANATION: The function `strcpy` is used to copy data from the string `argv[1]` into `buf1`. However, `strcpy` does not perform any bounds checking, so it will continue copying data until it encounters a null character. If the length of `argv[1]` is greater than `BUFSIZE`, then `strcpy` will write past the end of `buf1`, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`, and specify the maximum number of characters to copy. Alternatively, use `memcpy` and manually check the length of the source and destination buffers to prevent buffer overflows. Always check the return value of `malloc` to ensure that memory allocation was successful. In this case, the line `free(buf2);` is suspicious, as `buf2` is not being used. This line should be removed or replaced with
