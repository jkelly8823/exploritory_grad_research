 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability in the AuthenticateUser function.
EXPLANATION: The AuthenticateUser function is called with user input ($_POST['user'] and $_POST['password']) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, use a library like PDO to execute the query with placeholders for the user input. Additionally, consider using a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store passwords securely. 

Note: The code snippet is missing the definition of the AuthenticateUser function, but based on the context, it is likely that it is vulnerable to SQL injection.
