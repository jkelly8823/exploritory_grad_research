VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input ($username and $password) into the database query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use PDO or MySQLi to execute the query with placeholders for the user input, and then bind the input values to those placeholders. This ensures that the user input is treated as literal input, rather than part of the SQL code. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate user input and ensure it conforms to expected formats.
