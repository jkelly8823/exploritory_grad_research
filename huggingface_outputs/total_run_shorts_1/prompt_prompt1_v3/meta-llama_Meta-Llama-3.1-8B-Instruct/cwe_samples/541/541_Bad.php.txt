VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded database credentials are a significant security risk as they can be easily accessed by unauthorized users.
EXPLANATION: The provided PHP code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, which are stored in plain text. This is a major security concern as it allows anyone with access to the code to obtain the database credentials. Hardcoded credentials should be avoided and instead, stored securely using environment variables or a secrets management system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Store database credentials securely using environment variables or a secrets management system.
2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.
3. Consider using a configuration file or a database to store sensitive information.  ```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```  ```php
```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```  ```php
```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```  ```php
```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```  ```php
```php
