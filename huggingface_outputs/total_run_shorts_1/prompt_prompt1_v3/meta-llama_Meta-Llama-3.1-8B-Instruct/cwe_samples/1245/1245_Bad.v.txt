VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential race condition in the FSM due to the lack of synchronization between the `rst_n` and `user_input` signals.
EXPLANATION: The FSM uses `rst_n` to reset the state to 0, but it also uses `user_input` to determine the next state. However, `user_input` is not synchronized with the clock edge, which means that the next state could be set before the current state is fully propagated. This could lead to a race condition where the FSM enters an invalid state.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should synchronize the `user_input` signal with the clock edge using a flip-flop or a clocked register. This will ensure that the next state is set only after the current state is fully propagated. For example, you can add a clocked register to store the `user_input` value and then use that value to determine the next state. This will prevent the potential race condition and ensure that the FSM operates correctly.
