VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The equals method is vulnerable to NullPointerException when the object being compared is null. Additionally, it is vulnerable to ClassCastException when the object being compared is not an instance of Truck. Furthermore, the equals method does not handle the case when the Truck objects being compared have the same make and model but different years.
EXPLANATION: The equals method in the given code snippet is not correctly overridden. It does not follow the proper steps for comparing objects. Firstly, it checks if the object being compared is null, which is correct. However, it then checks if the object being compared is the same as the current object, which is also correct. However, it then checks if the object being compared is an instance of Truck, which is incorrect. It should check if the object being compared is an instance of Object, not Truck. Additionally, the equals method does not handle the case when the Truck objects being compared have the same make and model but different years. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing Truck objects.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The equals method should be overridden to correctly compare Truck objects. It should first check if the object being compared is null
