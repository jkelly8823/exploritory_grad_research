VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: CWE-259: Hard-coded password. CWE-309: Use of password system for authentication. 
EXPLANATION: This code contains a hard-coded password, which is a serious security risk. The AuthenticateUser function uses the hard-coded password to authenticate the user. Additionally, the code uses a password system for authentication, which is also a security risk. The function uses the strncmp function with the hard-coded password and the provided password, which can lead to authentication bypass. Furthermore, the function uses the logEvent function to log events, which can lead to information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The hard-coded password should be replaced with a secure password storage mechanism, such as a hash-based password storage system. The password system for authentication should be replaced with a more secure authentication mechanism, such as a token-based system. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that sensitive information is not logged. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the usage of the strncmp function is secure. The function should be modified to use a more secure comparison function, such as a hash-based comparison function.  The function should also be modified to handle errors and exceptions
