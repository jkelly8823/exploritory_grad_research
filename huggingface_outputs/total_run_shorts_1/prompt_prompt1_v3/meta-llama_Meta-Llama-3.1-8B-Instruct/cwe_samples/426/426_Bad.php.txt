VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: The system function is being used to execute a command that includes user input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious behavior. This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a safer method to execute the command, such as using a library that properly sanitizes user input. Alternatively, use a whitelist approach to only allow specific commands to be executed. In this case, consider using the `exec` function with a properly sanitized command string, or using a library like `proc_open` to execute the command in a safer manner. Additionally, consider logging the command being executed to detect any suspicious activity.  The use of `system` function is discouraged due to its potential for command injection.  Consider using `exec` or `proc_open` instead.  Also, consider using a more secure method to get the process list, such as using the `ps` command with the `-u` option to specify the user.  This will prevent the need to use `grep` and reduce the attack surface.  Finally
