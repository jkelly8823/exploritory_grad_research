VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The `INITCMD` variable is concatenated with the `home` variable to form the command string. An attacker could manipulate the `INITCMD` variable to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a parameterized approach to build the command string, such as using `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime.exec(String[])`. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious commands. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to validate the `INITCMD` variable to ensure it only contains expected characters.
