VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the code. The function `cointains_char` dynamically allocates memory for a string, but does not check if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the function will attempt to use a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault. Additionally, the function uses `strcpy` to copy a string into the allocated memory, but does not check if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the source string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than the allocated buffer.
EXPLANATION: The function `cointains_char` is designed to search for a character in a string. However, it uses dynamic memory allocation to store the string, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The function allocates memory for a string using `malloc`, but does not check if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, the function will attempt to use a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault. Additionally, the function uses `strcpy` to copy a string into the allocated memory, but does not check if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the source string. This
