VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code snippet appears to be a valid Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. It defines a storage account resource with the name "{StorageAccountName}" and enables HTTPS traffic only. However, the lack of validation for the "name" property may be considered a vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
The "name" property is a string that can be used to identify the storage account. However, if the value of this property is not properly validated, it may lead to a situation where an attacker can create a storage account with a name that is not valid or is already in use. This could potentially lead to security issues or errors in the deployment process.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can add validation to the "name" property to ensure that it meets the required format and is not already in use. This can be done by using Azure Resource Manager's built-in validation functions, such as `resourceId` or `resourceGroup`. For example, you can add a condition to check if the name is not empty and does not contain any invalid characters. Additionally, you can use Azure's built-in storage account name validation to ensure that
