VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a session fixation attack. This is because the session ID is generated on the server-side, but it is sent to the client in the response. An attacker could intercept the response and obtain the session ID, then use it to authenticate to the server.
EXPLANATION: This code is vulnerable because it sends the session ID in the response. This allows an attacker to obtain the session ID and use it to authenticate to the server. To fix this, the session ID should be generated on the client-side, or the server should verify the session ID on each request to ensure it matches the expected value.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a client-side solution such as a JavaScript library to generate the session ID. Alternatively, implement server-side verification of the session ID on each request. This can be done by storing the expected session ID in a secure location and verifying it against the value sent in the request. Another option is to use a token-based authentication system, where a token is generated on the client-side and verified on the server-side. This would prevent an attacker from obtaining the session ID and using it
