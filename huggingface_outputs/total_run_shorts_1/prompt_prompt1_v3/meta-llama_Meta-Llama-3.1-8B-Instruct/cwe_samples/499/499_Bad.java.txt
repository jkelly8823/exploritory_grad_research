VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The class PatientRecord has a public constructor that allows an attacker to directly set the social security number of a patient record. This is a security risk because social security numbers are sensitive information and should not be exposed.
EXPLANATION: The constructor of the class PatientRecord is public, which means that any class can create an instance of PatientRecord and set its social security number. This is a problem because social security numbers are sensitive information and should not be exposed. A better approach would be to make the constructor private and provide a public method to create a new instance of PatientRecord.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Make the constructor private and provide a public method to create a new instance of PatientRecord. For example, you could add a public static method to the class that creates a new instance of PatientRecord and sets the social security number. This would ensure that the social security number is only set by authorized code.
