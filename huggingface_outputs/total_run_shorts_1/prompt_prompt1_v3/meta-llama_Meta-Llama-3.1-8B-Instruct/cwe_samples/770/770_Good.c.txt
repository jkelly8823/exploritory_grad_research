VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking on the message array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet does not check the bounds of the message array before accessing its elements. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the message array is larger than expected, potentially causing the program to crash or execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add bounds checking to ensure that the message array index is within the valid range before accessing its elements. This can be done by checking the length of the message array and ensuring that the index is less than the length. For example: if ((length > 0) && (length <= MAX_LENGTH) && (index < length)) {...}. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a dynamically allocated array or a container class, to avoid buffer overflows. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
