VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the lack of a timeout for the server socket. This allows an attacker to consume all available system resources by continuously connecting to the server without being properly handled.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet creates a server socket and enters a loop where it continuously accepts new connections. However, it does not implement any mechanism to handle or timeout connections that are not properly closed. This can lead to a situation where the server becomes unresponsive due to an excessive number of open connections. An attacker can exploit this by continuously connecting to the server without closing the connections, causing the server to consume all available system resources.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To mitigate this vulnerability, implement a timeout for the server socket using the `setSoTimeout()` method. This will allow the server to close idle connections after a specified period of time. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent connections to prevent resource exhaustion. For example, you can use a `Semaphore` to limit the number of threads that can access the server socket at the same time. ```java
serverSocket.setSoTimeout(
