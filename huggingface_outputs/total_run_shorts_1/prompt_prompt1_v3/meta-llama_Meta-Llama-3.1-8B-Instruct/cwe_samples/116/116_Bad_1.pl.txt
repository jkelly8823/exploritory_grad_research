VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks due to the direct execution of user-supplied input ($inputString) without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability arises from the use of the `split` function to split the input string into a command and an argument string, without any validation or sanitization of the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the input string, potentially leading to unauthorized access or execution of arbitrary code. Furthermore, the use of `UrlEncode` on the argument string does not prevent command injection attacks, as it only encodes special characters and does not validate the input.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input string before executing it. This can be achieved by using a whitelisting approach, where only a predefined set of commands and arguments are allowed. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to execute the command, such as using a command execution library or a sandboxed environment. The `GetServerFileHandle` function should also be reviewed to ensure it does not introduce any additional vulnerabilities.  URL encoding the argument string is insufficient to prevent
