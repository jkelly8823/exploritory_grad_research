VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Code Injection via Command Execution
EXPLANATION: The `doit` subroutine executes a system command that includes a user-inputted value. This input is not sanitized or validated, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious commands. The `encode` function attempts to sanitize the input, but it only replaces certain special characters with their HTML equivalents, which may not be enough to prevent code injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a whitelist approach to validate user input, and ensure that any system commands are executed with a minimum of privileges. Consider using a library like `IPC::Open3` to safely execute commands. Additionally, consider using a templating engine to separate presentation logic from business logic. The `encode` function should be modified to replace all special characters, not just a select few, and the `doit` subroutine should be modified to use a safer method of executing system commands.  It is also recommended to use a secure method of storing and retrieving user data, such as a database.  The `GetUntrustedInput` function should be removed or modified to not directly expose user input.  The use of `system` is also
