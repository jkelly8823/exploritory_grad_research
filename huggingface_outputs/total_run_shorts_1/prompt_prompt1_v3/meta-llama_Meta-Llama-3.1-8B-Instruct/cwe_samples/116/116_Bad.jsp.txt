VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is using a String interpolation to directly inject user input into the HTML output. This is a classic example of a SQL Injection vulnerability, as an attacker can manipulate the "email" parameter to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data tampering, or even complete system compromise.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a prepared statement or parameterized query to prevent SQL Injection attacks. In this case, since it appears to be a simple HTML output, using a parameterized query is not necessary. However, it's still recommended to use a method like `request.getParameter("email").trim()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and then use a simple string concatenation to display the email address. This will prevent any potential issues with the email address being displayed incorrectly. Alternatively, consider using a templating engine or a Java-based HTML templating library to render the email address, which can help prevent such vulnerabilities.  Additionally, validate user input to ensure it matches the expected format for an email address.  Consider using a library like Apache Commons Validator to validate the email
