VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious commands by manipulating the input string read from the file handle.
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability lies in the way the code parses the input string. The input string is read from a file handle, which may contain malicious input. The code then splits the input string into commands based on the "|" character, and then splits each command into an operator and arguments based on a single whitespace. However, this approach does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the input string. For example, an attacker could inject a command like "BAN|example.com; rm -rf /" which would execute the "rm -rf /" command on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly sanitize the input string before parsing it. This can be done by using a regular expression to validate the input string and ensure it conforms to a specific format. Additionally, the code should use a secure method to execute the commands, such as using a command execution library that properly sanitizes the input. Finally, the code should implement proper
