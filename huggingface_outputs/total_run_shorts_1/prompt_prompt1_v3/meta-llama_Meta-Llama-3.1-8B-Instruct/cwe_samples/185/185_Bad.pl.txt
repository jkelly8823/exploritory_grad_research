 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to shell injection attacks. The system function is used to execute a command that includes user input without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION: The $phone variable is used as input to the system function. However, it is not sanitized or validated to prevent malicious input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the $phone variable. For example, an attacker could input something like "lookup-phone; rm -rf /" to execute a malicious command.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use a whitelisting approach to validate the input and ensure that only expected commands are executed. You can use regular expressions to validate the input and prevent any malicious characters from being executed. Alternatively, you can use a safer alternative to the system function, such as a library that provides a secure way to execute commands. Additionally, it's recommended to log any errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of the command to detect any potential security issues.  It's also recommended to use a secure way to pass the phone number to the lookup-phone command, such as using environment variables or command line arguments.
