VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 9, 11, 13, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The length of the file is obtained using `infile.tellg()` which may not be accurate due to the file being opened in text mode. This can lead to a buffer overflow when reading the file contents into the `buffer` array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the incorrect calculation of the file length. The `infile.tellg()` function returns the current position of the file pointer, which may not be accurate if the file is opened in text mode. This can lead to a buffer overflow when reading the file contents into the `buffer` array. Additionally, the code does not check for memory allocation failures when allocating memory for the `buffer` array. If the memory allocation fails, the program will crash or behave unexpectedly.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more accurate method to calculate the file length, such as using `infile.seekg (0, ios::end)` followed by `infile.tellg()`. Additionally, the code should check for memory allocation failures
