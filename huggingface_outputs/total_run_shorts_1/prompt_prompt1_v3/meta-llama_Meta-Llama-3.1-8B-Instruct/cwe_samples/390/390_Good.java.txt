VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. This is because the size of the character buffer is determined by the length of the file, which can be arbitrary large. An attacker could potentially craft a file that is larger than the buffer, causing the program to write past the end of the buffer and potentially leading to a security vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code reads the entire file into a character buffer, which is then converted to a string. However, the size of the buffer is determined by the length of the file, which can be arbitrary large. This means that an attacker could potentially craft a file that is larger than the buffer, causing the program to write past the end of the buffer and potentially leading to a security vulnerability. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method of reading the file, such as using a BufferedReader and reading the file in chunks. This would prevent the buffer from overflowing and would make the code more secure. Additionally, the code should check the length of the file before attempting to read it, to prevent attempting to read a file
