VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function readFile() is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the function uses the readlink() function to resolve symbolic links, but it does not properly sanitize the input. An attacker could potentially use a symbolic link to access files outside of the intended directory.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the function uses the readlink() function to resolve symbolic links, but it does not properly sanitize the input. This means that an attacker could potentially use a symbolic link to access files outside of the intended directory. For example, if the function is called with the argument '../secret.txt', it could potentially access a file outside of the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to properly sanitize the input. This could be done by using a function like realpath() to resolve the path to an absolute path, and then checking if the file exists and is owned by the user. Additionally, the function should be modified to prevent the use of symbolic links. This could be done by checking if the file is a symbolic link before attempting to read it. If it is a symbolic link, the function should return an
