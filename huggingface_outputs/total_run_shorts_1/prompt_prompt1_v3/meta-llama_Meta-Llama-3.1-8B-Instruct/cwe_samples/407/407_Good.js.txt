VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The regular expression pattern is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking due to the use of a possessive quantifier (\2) without a limit on the number of repetitions.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression pattern is attempting to match a string that contains a sequence of words separated by whitespace. However, the use of the possessive quantifier (\2) without a limit on the number of repetitions can cause the engine to enter an infinite loop when the input string contains a large number of words. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the possessive quantifier should be replaced with a non-possessive quantifier, and a limit should be set on the number of repetitions. For example: `var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?){1,100}$/i;` This will prevent the engine from entering an infinite loop and reduce the risk of a DoS attack. Alternatively, the regular expression pattern can be rewritten to use a more efficient algorithm, such as using a possessive quantifier with a limit on the number of repetitions,
