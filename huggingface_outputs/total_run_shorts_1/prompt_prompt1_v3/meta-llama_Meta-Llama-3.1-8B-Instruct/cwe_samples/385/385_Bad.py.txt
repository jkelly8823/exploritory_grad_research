VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack. The function validate_password() returns 0 as soon as it finds a mismatch between the actual and typed passwords. This allows an attacker to determine the length of the password and potentially the position of the mismatched character.
EXPLANATION: The function validate_password() iterates over the length of the password, which is a constant value. However, the function returns 0 as soon as it finds a mismatch, which allows an attacker to determine the length of the password. This is a timing attack vulnerability. Additionally, the function uses the <> operator, which is deprecated in Python 3.x. It is recommended to use the!= operator instead.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the function should iterate over the actual and typed passwords simultaneously, using the zip() function to pair corresponding characters. The function should also use the!= operator instead of the <> operator. Here is an example of how the function could be fixed: def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw): if len(actual_pw)!= len(typed_pw): return 0 for actual_char, typed_char in zip(actual_pw, typed_pw):
