VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is because the user input is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query. The mysql_real_escape_string() function is used to escape the user input, but it is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the user input. For example, if the user input is'OR 1=1 --', the SQL query will be executed as 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --'' AND password = '' OR 1=1 --''', which will return all users. This is a classic example of a SQL injection attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should use prepared statements or parameterized queries. This will ensure that the user input is properly sanitized and cannot be used to inject malicious SQL code. You can use the PDO extension in PHP to implement prepared statements. For example, you can use the following code to fix the vulnerability: 
```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username
