VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a predictable random number generator due to seeding the random number generator with the current time. This allows an attacker to potentially predict the sequence of random numbers generated.
EXPLANATION: The srand() function seeds the random number generator with the current time. This means that if the code is run multiple times in a short period of time, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated. This can be exploited by an attacker to predict the sequence of random numbers generated.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a more secure method to seed the random number generator, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) or a random number generator that is designed to be unpredictable. One example is the /dev/urandom device on Unix-like systems. Alternatively, you can use a different method to seed the random number generator, such as using the current process ID or a random number from a CSPRNG.  Also, consider using a more secure random number generator, such as the one provided by the OpenSSL library.  In this case, you can use the RAND_bytes() function to generate a cryptographically secure random number
