VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack because it directly uses user input from the request parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The code directly uses the user input from the request parameter 'itemName' without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the 'itemName' parameter. For example, an attacker could inject a SQL query by setting 'itemName' to something like "' OR 1=1 --". This would allow the attacker to bypass authentication or access sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly validate and sanitize the user input. This can be achieved by using a prepared statement or a parameterized query. For example, the code could be modified to use a prepared statement like this: "SELECT * FROM table WHERE item_name =?" and then set the parameter value to the sanitized 'itemName' value. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized throughout the application.
