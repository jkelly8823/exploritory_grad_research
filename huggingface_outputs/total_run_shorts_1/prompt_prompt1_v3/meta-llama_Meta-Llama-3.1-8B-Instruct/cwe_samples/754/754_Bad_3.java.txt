VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The `System.clearProperty()` method is used to clear the "os.name" property, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the system's identification.
EXPLANATION: The `System.clearProperty()` method is used to clear the "os.name" property, which can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the system's identification. This can lead to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The attacker can clear the "os.name" property and then use the `System.getProperty()` method to retrieve the manipulated value, which can cause the system to behave unexpectedly or crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `System.clearProperty()` method should not be used to clear the "os.name" property. Instead, the property should be checked for its original value before using it. This can be done by storing the original value in a variable before clearing the property and then comparing the retrieved value with the original value. If the values do not match, the system should behave accordingly. Additionally, the `System.getProperty()` method should be used with caution
