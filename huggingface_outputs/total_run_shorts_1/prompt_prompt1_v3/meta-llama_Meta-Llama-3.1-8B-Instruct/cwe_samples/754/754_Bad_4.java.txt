VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential null pointer exception when calling the readFromFile() method. This is because the readFile variable is not initialized before it is used in the FileReader constructor.
EXPLANATION: The issue arises because the readFile variable is declared but not initialized before it is used in the readFromFile() method. This can lead to a null pointer exception when the readFromFile() method is called. The variable is initialized in the setInputFile() method, but this method is not guaranteed to be called before readFromFile(). Therefore, the readFile variable may be null when readFromFile() is called, resulting in a null pointer exception.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the readFile variable should be initialized before it is used in the readFromFile() method. This can be done by calling the setInputFile() method before calling readFromFile(). Alternatively, the readFromFile() method can be modified to check if the readFile variable is null before using it, and throw an exception or handle the situation accordingly. Additionally, it would be a good practice to check if the file exists before attempting to read it. This can be done by using the File.exists() method.  The
