VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a file descriptor leak. The file descriptor is not closed in the case where the file cannot be opened for writing.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to open a file for writing, but if the file cannot be opened, the file descriptor is not closed. This can lead to a file descriptor leak, where the file descriptor is not released back to the system, potentially causing issues with file descriptor limits.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The file descriptor should be closed in the case where the file cannot be opened for writing. This can be achieved by adding a call to closeFile(filename) before returning from the function. Alternatively, the function can be modified to use a try-catch block to handle the error and close the file descriptor in the catch block. 

```c
int outputStringToFile(char *output, char *filename) {
    int isOutput = SUCCESS;
    int isOpen = openFileToWrite(filename);
    if (isOpen == FAIL) {
        printf("Unable to open file %s", filename);
        isOutput = FAIL;
    } else {
        int isWrite = writeToFile
