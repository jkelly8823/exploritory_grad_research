VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the direct inclusion of user input in the message file and the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the input.
EXPLANATION: The code directly includes user input from the $_GET array into the message file without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, such as JavaScript, into the message file, which can be executed by other users when they view the messages. The include statement in the "ViewMessages" action also allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code, further increasing the risk of XSS attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize and encode the user input before writing it to the message file. This can be achieved by using functions like htmlspecialchars() or filter_var() to remove any malicious characters. Additionally, the include statement should be replaced with a safer method, such as using a templating engine or a secure include function that prevents the execution of arbitrary PHP code. The code should also be updated to handle errors and exceptions properly to prevent further
