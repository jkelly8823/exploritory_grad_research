VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of the `strcmp` function with a compressed password. If the compressed password is longer than the buffer allocated for it, it can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
EXPLANATION: The `strcmp` function is used to compare two strings. However, in this case, it is used with a compressed password, which can be longer than the original password. If the compressed password is longer than the buffer allocated for it, it can cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a safer string comparison function, such as `strncmp`, which allows specifying the maximum number of characters to compare. Additionally, the code should check the length of the compressed password before comparing it to the buffer. This can be done by using the `strlen` function to get the length of the compressed password and comparing it to the length of the buffer. If the lengths are different, the code should return an error or handle the situation accordingly. The code should
