 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack because it directly uses user input (password from the properties file) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the DriverManager.getConnection method to establish a database connection. However, it directly uses the password from the properties file as a parameter to the method. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the password value in the properties file. For example, an attacker could set the password value to something like "'; DROP TABLE users; --" to execute a malicious SQL query.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The corrected code should look like this: String password = prop.getProperty("password"); String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE password =?"; PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query); pstmt.setString(1, password); pstmt.executeQuery();... where conn is a valid database connection object. This way, the password is treated as a parameter and not as part of the SQL query, preventing any potential SQL injection attacks.
