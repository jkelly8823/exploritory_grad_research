VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded credentials are present in the code.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded credentials, specifically a username and password, which are stored in plain text. This is a security risk as an attacker could potentially access these credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the credentials should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable or a secrets management system. The code should be modified to retrieve the credentials from a secure location instead of hardcoding them. Additionally, consider implementing a mechanism to rotate the credentials periodically to minimize the impact of a potential breach.  ```bash
# Example of how to store credentials securely in an environment variable
# webapp.ldap.username=${LDAP_USERNAME}
# webapp.ldap.password=${LDAP_PASSWORD}
```  ```java
// Example of how to retrieve credentials from a secure location
// Properties properties = new Properties();
// properties.load(new FileInputStream("path/to/credentials.properties"));
// String username = properties.getProperty("webapp.ldap.username");
// String password = properties.getProperty("webapp.ldap.password");
```  ```java
