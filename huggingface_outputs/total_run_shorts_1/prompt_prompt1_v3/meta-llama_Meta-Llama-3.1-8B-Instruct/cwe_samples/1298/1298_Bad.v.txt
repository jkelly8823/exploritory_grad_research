VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability related to the "glitch in signal z" due to a potential race condition caused by the use of non-blocking assignments.
EXPLANATION: In the given Verilog code, the signal `z` is assigned using non-blocking assignments (`assign`) which can lead to a race condition. This is because non-blocking assignments do not update the signal values immediately, but rather schedule them to be updated in the next clock cycle. In this case, the assignment of `z` depends on the values of `and_out1` and `and_out2`, which are also assigned using non-blocking assignments. This can cause the signal `z` to be updated incorrectly, leading to a glitch.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use blocking assignments instead of non-blocking assignments. This can be achieved by replacing the `assign` statements with `wire` assignments and then using a `always` block to update the signals in a blocking manner. For example: 
```verilog
wire z;
always @(*) begin
    z = and_out1 | and_out2;
end
```
