VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The buffer size of 20 is insufficient to hold the string "hello world" which has a length of 11. When strcat() is called, it will write beyond the bounds of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Increase the buffer size to accommodate the maximum length of the string to be concatenated. For example, char str[50];. Alternatively, use a dynamically allocated buffer or a safer string concatenation function like strncat().  Additionally, consider using a safer function like snprintf() for printing the string to prevent further potential issues.  Consider using a safer function like fgets() for reading the string to prevent further potential issues.
