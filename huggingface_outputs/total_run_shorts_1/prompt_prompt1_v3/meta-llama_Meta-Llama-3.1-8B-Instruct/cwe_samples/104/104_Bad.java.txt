VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm which is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the use of a deprecated class. The class ActionForm is deprecated in Struts 1.3 and later versions, and its use can lead to security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION: The class ActionForm is a part of the Struts framework, which has been deprecated in later versions. This is because the class does not follow the best practices for form handling and can lead to security issues. It is recommended to use the ActionFormBean class instead, which is the recommended replacement for ActionForm.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the class ActionForm with ActionFormBean. The corrected code should be public class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.action.ActionFormBean { ... }. Additionally, ensure that the Struts version being used is 1.3 or later, and update the code accordingly.
