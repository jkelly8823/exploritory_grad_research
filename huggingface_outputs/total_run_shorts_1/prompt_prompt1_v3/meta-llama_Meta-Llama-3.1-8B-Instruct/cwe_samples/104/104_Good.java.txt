VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorForm, which is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack via the Struts vulnerability CVE-2013-6384.
EXPLANATION: The class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorForm, which is a known vulnerable class due to a remote code execution (RCE) attack via the Struts vulnerability CVE-2013-6384. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code via a malicious request, potentially leading to remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The class RegistrationForm should be refactored to extend a non-vulnerable class or implement the necessary security patches to fix the CVE-2013-6384 vulnerability. Additionally, consider using a more secure validation framework to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future. It is also recommended to upgrade the Struts version to a patched version.  If upgrading is not possible, consider using a different validation framework to avoid the risk of RCE attacks.  It is also recommended to run regular security audits to identify and fix any other potential vulnerabilities.  Consider using a static code analysis tool to identify potential security vulnerabilities in
