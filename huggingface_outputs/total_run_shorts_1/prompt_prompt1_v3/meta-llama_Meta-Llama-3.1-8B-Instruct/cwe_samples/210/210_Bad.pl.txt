VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The regular expression used to validate the username does not prevent the injection of shell metacharacters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
EXPLANATION: The regular expression `^\w+$` only checks if the username contains word characters (letters, numbers, and underscores). However, this does not prevent an attacker from injecting shell metacharacters, such as `;`, `|`, or `(`, which can be used to inject malicious commands. For example, an attacker could enter a username like `username; rm -rf /` to delete the root directory. The code also uses the `-e` operator to check if a file exists, which can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the filename is not properly sanitized.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more secure method to validate the username, such as using a whitelist of allowed characters or using a library that provides secure string validation. Additionally, the code should use a more secure method to check if a file exists, such as using the `file_exists` function or a library that
