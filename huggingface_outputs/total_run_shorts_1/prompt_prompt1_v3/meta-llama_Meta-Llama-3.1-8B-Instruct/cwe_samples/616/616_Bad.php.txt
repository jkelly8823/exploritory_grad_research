VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a temporary file exposure vulnerability. This is because the temporary file is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to potentially access or manipulate the file.
EXPLANATION: The code creates a temporary file on the local machine, but it does not properly validate or sanitize the file name, size, or type. This makes it possible for an attacker to manipulate the file name, size, or type, potentially leading to a temporary file exposure vulnerability. For example, an attacker could provide a malicious file name that contains a path traversal vulnerability, allowing them to access sensitive files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate and sanitize the file name, size, and type before creating the temporary file. This can be done by using a whitelist approach to validate the file name and size, and by checking the MIME type to ensure it is a valid type. Additionally, the code should ensure that the temporary file is properly cleaned up after use to prevent any potential security risks.  The code should also consider using a secure method to create the temporary file, such as using the `tempnam` function with a
