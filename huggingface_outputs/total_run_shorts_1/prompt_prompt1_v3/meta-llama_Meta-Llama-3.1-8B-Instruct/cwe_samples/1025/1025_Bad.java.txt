VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a "String Interning" issue. This occurs when two separate String objects are created with the same content and then compared using the "==" operator, which will return true because the strings are interned. However, this is not the desired behavior because it is comparing object references, not the actual string content.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet creates two separate String objects, str1 and str2, using the "new String()" constructor. However, when comparing these objects using the "==" operator, it will return true because the strings are interned. This is because the String class in Java caches a pool of unique strings, known as the "string constant pool". When the String constructor is called with a string literal, it checks if the string is already in the pool. If it is, it returns the existing reference. If not, it creates a new string and adds it to the pool. In this case, both str1 and str2 are created with the same string literal, "Hello", so they are interned and therefore equal when compared using "==".
