VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the use of a switch statement with a modulo operation on a user-controlled value (st_ctime).
EXPLANATION: The st_ctime field of the stat structure contains the time of last status change of the file. However, the code uses this value in a switch statement with a modulo operation, which can lead to a potential DoS attack. An attacker could create a file with a st_ctime value that is not a multiple of 2, causing the switch statement to fall through to the default case, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more robust way to handle the st_ctime value, such as using a conditional statement or a lookup table. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the st_ctime value is not user-controlled, as this could lead to further vulnerabilities. The switch statement should be avoided in this context, as it can lead to unexpected behavior due to the modulo operation. Instead, a simple if-else statement or a lookup table should
