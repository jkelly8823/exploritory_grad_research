VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to concatenation of user input into a string.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection and XSS attacks because it directly concatenates user input (`usernme` and `ccn`) into a string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code or JavaScript code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or code execution. The use of string concatenation instead of parameterized queries or prepared statements makes the code vulnerable to these types of attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. For example, you can use a library like `PreparedStatement` in Java or `parameterized queries` in SQL to safely execute queries with user input. Additionally, consider using a templating engine or a secure string concatenation method to prevent XSS attacks. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential security risks.  ```java
logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);
``` should be replaced with ```java
logger.info("Username: {}", usernme);
logger.info("
