VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is because the query string is constructed by concatenating user input (username and accountNumber) directly into the SQL query. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input values, allowing them to access or modify sensitive data in the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can be achieved by using a PreparedStatement object instead of a Statement object. For example, the query string can be set as a parameter using the setString() method, and the accountNumber can be set as a parameter using the setInt() method. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Here is an example of how the code can be modified to use a parameterized query: 
```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner =? AND accountID =?");
pstmt.setString(1, username);
pstmt.setInt(2, accountNumber);
ResultSet queryResult = pstmt.executeQuery();
```
