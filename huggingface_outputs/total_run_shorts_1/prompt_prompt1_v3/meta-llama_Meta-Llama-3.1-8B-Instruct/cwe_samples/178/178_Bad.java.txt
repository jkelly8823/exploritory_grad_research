VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The preventXSS function is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because it uses a regular expression to replace "script" with the mask, but it does not account for the possibility of the input containing a script tag with an attribute that includes the mask.
EXPLANATION: The input.replaceAll function is used to replace the string "script" with the mask. However, this does not prevent an attacker from injecting malicious script code by using the mask as an attribute of a script tag. For example, if the input is "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" and the mask is "MY_MASK", the output would be "<script>alert('XSS')</script>", which is still a script tag and can cause a XSS attack. To fix this, the function should be modified to use a more robust method for preventing XSS, such as using a library like OWASP ESAPI.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a more robust method for preventing XSS, such as using a library like OWASP ESAPI. The function should be modified to properly handle script tags and their attributes to prevent XSS attacks. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle other
