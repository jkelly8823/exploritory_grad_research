 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a brute-force attack due to the lack of rate limiting on login attempts. An attacker can repeatedly try different usernames and passwords, incrementing the login attempts counter each time, until the threshold of 5 failed attempts is reached, at which point the attacker's IP address is logged.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet provided is a login function that checks the authenticity of a user's credentials. However, it does not implement any rate limiting measures to prevent brute-force attacks. This allows an attacker to repeatedly try different usernames and passwords, incrementing the login attempts counter each time. Once the threshold of 5 failed attempts is reached, the attacker's IP address is logged, but this does not prevent the attack from occurring. A more robust solution would be to implement a rate limiting mechanism, such as a token bucket algorithm, to limit the number of login attempts within a certain time window.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, implement a rate limiting mechanism, such as a token bucket algorithm, to limit the number of login attempts within a certain time window. This can be achieved by introducing a new variable to track the number of allowed
