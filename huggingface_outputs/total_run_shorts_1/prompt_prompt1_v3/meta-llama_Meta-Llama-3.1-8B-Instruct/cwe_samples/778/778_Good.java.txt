VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential denial of service (DoS) attack due to the repeated login attempts without any rate limiting or backoff mechanism.
EXPLANATION: The code attempts to login a user and if the login is unsuccessful, it retries the login. However, there is no mechanism to limit the number of login attempts or to introduce a delay between attempts. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can repeatedly attempt to login with different credentials, causing the system to be overwhelmed and potentially leading to a denial of service.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a rate limiting mechanism to limit the number of login attempts within a certain time window. Additionally, introduce a backoff mechanism to increase the delay between attempts after each failure. This can be achieved by using a library such as Redis or a similar in-memory data store to track the number of attempts and the time of the last attempt. The system can then use this information to determine whether to allow a new login attempt and to calculate the delay before allowing the next attempt.  ```java
if (LoginUser()) {
    // Login successful
    log.warn("Login by user successful.");
