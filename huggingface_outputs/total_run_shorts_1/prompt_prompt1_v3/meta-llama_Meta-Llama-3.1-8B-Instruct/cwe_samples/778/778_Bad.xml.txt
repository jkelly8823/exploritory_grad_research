VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The serviceSecurityAudit element is not properly configured to handle audit failures, which could lead to security issues if the audit log is not properly maintained.
EXPLANATION: The serviceSecurityAudit element has the suppressAuditFailure attribute set to false, which means that if the audit log cannot be written, the service will fail. However, the serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel and messageAuthenticationAuditLevel attributes are set to None, which means that no audit logging will occur for authorization and message authentication events. This could lead to security issues if the audit log is not properly maintained.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Set the suppressAuditFailure attribute to true to prevent the service from failing if the audit log cannot be written. Additionally, set the serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel and messageAuthenticationAuditLevel attributes to a level that is appropriate for the service, such as Error or Warning, to ensure that audit logging occurs for authorization and message authentication events. For example: <serviceSecurityAudit auditLogLocation="Default" suppressAuditFailure="true" serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel="Error" messageAuthenticationAuditLevel="Error" />.
