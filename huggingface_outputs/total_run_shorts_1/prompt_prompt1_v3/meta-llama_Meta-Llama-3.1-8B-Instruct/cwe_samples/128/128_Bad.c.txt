VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory leak due to missing free() call for dynamically allocated memory.
EXPLANATION: The code dynamically allocates memory using malloc() for an array of img_t structures. However, it does not include a corresponding free() call to release this memory when it is no longer needed. This will cause a memory leak, where memory is allocated but never freed, leading to increased memory usage over time.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a free() call to release the allocated memory when it is no longer needed. For example, when the program terminates or when the data is no longer required. The corrected code would be: table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs); ... free(table_ptr);. 

Note: The ... indicates that the free() call should be placed before the end of the program or before the data is no longer required.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of unchecked malloc() return value, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if malloc() fails.
EXPLANATION: The code uses malloc() to allocate memory, but it
