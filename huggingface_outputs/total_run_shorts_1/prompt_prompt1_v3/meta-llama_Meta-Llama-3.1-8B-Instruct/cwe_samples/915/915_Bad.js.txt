VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function setValueByPath does not properly handle cases where the path is not a string, or where the path is a string but does not contain a valid attribute name. This can lead to a TypeError when trying to access objectToModify[attr].
EXPLANATION: The function does not check if the path is a string before splitting it. If the path is not a string, then path.split(".") will throw a TypeError. Additionally, the function does not check if the attribute name is a valid JavaScript identifier. If the attribute name is not a valid identifier, then objectToModify[attr] will throw a TypeError.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that the path is a string before splitting it. You should also add a check to ensure that the attribute name is a valid JavaScript identifier. You can use the typeof operator to check if the path is a string, and you can use a regular expression to check if the attribute name is a valid identifier. For example: if (typeof path!=='string') { throw new Error('Path must be a string'); } if (!/^[a-zA-Z_$][
