VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function setValueByPath does not properly handle cases where the path is an array. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to set a value on an object using an array as the path.
EXPLANATION: The function uses the split method to split the path into an array of attributes. However, it does not check if the path is an array before doing so. If the path is an array, the split method will return an array of strings, and the function will attempt to access the array as if it were an object. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this issue, the function should first check if the path is an array before attempting to split it. If the path is an array, the function should iterate over the array and access the object using the array indices. If the path is not an array, the function should proceed as it does currently. This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function: if (Array.isArray(path)) {... } else {... }. Additionally, the function should also handle cases where the path is a string, but contains
