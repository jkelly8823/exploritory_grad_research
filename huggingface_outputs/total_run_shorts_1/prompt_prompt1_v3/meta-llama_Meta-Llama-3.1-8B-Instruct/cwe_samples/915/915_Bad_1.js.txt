VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype pollution vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The `setValueByPath` function is being used to set a value on the `__proto__` property of an object, which can lead to prototype pollution. This is a security vulnerability because it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties onto the prototype chain of an object, potentially leading to unintended behavior or security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, avoid using `__proto__` and instead use the `Object.create` method to create a new object with the desired prototype. Alternatively, use a library or framework that provides a safe way to set values on the prototype chain. Additionally, consider using a linter or code analysis tool to detect and prevent prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the future.  The `setValueByPath` function should be reviewed to ensure it does not allow prototype pollution.  If it does, it should be modified to prevent it.  If it cannot be modified, it should be replaced with a safer alternative.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that no other instances of prototype pollution exist.  If any are found, they should be fixed.  Consider using
