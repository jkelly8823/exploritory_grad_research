VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the for loop.
EXPLANATION: The for loop iterates 6 times, but the loop counter j is declared as an integer that can potentially overflow when j is larger than its maximum value. Although the loop counter is incremented by 1 each time, the loop counter is not checked for overflow. This can potentially cause the loop to run indefinitely or access memory outside the intended bounds.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Add a check to prevent the loop counter from overflowing. This can be done by using a type that cannot overflow, such as a unsigned integer, or by checking the value of the loop counter before each iteration. For example, you can add a condition to the if statement to check if j is within the valid range before accessing reglk_mem[j].
