VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The buffer size of 20 is insufficient to hold the string "hello world" which has a length of 11. When strcat() is called, it will write beyond the bounds of the buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Increase the buffer size to accommodate the maximum expected length of the string. For example, char str[50];. Alternatively, use a dynamically allocated buffer or a safer string function like snprintf().  Additionally, consider using a safer string function like snprintf() to prevent buffer overflows.
