VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A race condition vulnerability exists due to the speculative nature of the always_ff block.
EXPLANATION: The always_ff block is triggered on every positive edge of the clk_i signal. However, the assignments to raddr_q and mem are not properly synchronized with the clock signal. This can lead to a race condition where the values of raddr_q and mem are overwritten before they are fully latched, resulting in unpredictable behavior. Furthermore, the assign statement for rdata_o does not account for the speculative nature of the always_ff block, potentially leading to incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the always_ff block should be modified to use a non-speculative clocking scheme, such as a single clocked process. Additionally, the assign statement for rdata_o should be modified to account for the speculative nature of the always_ff block. This can be achieved by using a non-speculative clocking scheme for the assign statement as well. Alternatively, the entire design can be modified to use a more robust and synchronous design methodology.  The use of $clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3] to index
