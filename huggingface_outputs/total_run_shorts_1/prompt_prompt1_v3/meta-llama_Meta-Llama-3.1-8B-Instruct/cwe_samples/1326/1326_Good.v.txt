VULNERABLE_LINES: 8, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow. The value of `raddr_q` is not checked against the maximum valid address in the ROM before it is used as an index into the `mem` array.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a combination of a counter-based address generator and a speculative fetch stage. However, the value of `raddr_q` is not validated against the maximum valid address in the ROM, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access. This could result in a buffer overflow, potentially causing the program to crash or produce incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, you should add a check to ensure that `raddr_q` is within the valid address range before using it as an index into the `mem` array. You can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if `raddr_q` is less than `RomSize` before accessing `mem[raddr_q]`. The corrected code would be: `assign rdata_o = (raddr_q >= 0 && raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;`  or
