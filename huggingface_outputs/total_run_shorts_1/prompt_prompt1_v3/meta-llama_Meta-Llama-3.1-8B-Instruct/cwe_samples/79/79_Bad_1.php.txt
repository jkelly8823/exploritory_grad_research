VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection and Password Storage Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of sprintf() with user input. The user input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Additionally, the password is stored in plaintext using the crypt() function, which is not secure. The mysql_real_escape_string() function is used to prevent SQL injection, but it is not sufficient to prevent all types of SQL injection attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
2. Store passwords securely using a password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
3. Remove the use of mysql_real_escape_string() and instead use prepared statements.
4. Consider upgrading to a more secure database driver like PDO.
