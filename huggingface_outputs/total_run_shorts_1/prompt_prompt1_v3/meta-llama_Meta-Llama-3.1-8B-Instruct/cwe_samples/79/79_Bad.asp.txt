VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The EmployeeID.Text is being set to the value of Login.Text, which is user input and can be manipulated by an attacker. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Login.Text field, which can then be executed by the EmployeeID.Text property.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is using a server-side control (TextBox) to store user input, but it is not properly sanitizing or validating the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the input field, which can then be executed by the server. The EmployeeID.Text property is being set to the value of Login.Text, which means that any malicious code injected into the Login.Text field will be executed when the EmployeeID.Text property is accessed.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize and validate the user input before setting it to the EmployeeID.Text property. This can be done by using a library such as AntiXSS to sanitize the input, or by using a regular expression to validate the input. Additionally, the code should be modified to
