VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user input (`eid`) into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `eid` variable. The use of `String` concatenation instead of a parameterized query or prepared statement makes the code susceptible to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a parameterized query or prepared statement to separate the SQL code from the user input. For example, you can use a `PreparedStatement` to execute the query: `PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from emp where id=?"); pstmt.setString(1, eid); ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();`. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Additionally, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to abstract the database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection.
