VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The variable $query is directly constructed from user input and then executed as a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input to the query.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. In this case, you can use the mysql_real_escape_string() function to escape any special characters in the input, but this is not recommended as it is not foolproof and can be bypassed by an attacker. A better approach would be to switch to a more modern database API such as PDO or MySQLi, which support prepared statements. For example, you can use the following code to fix the vulnerability: $query = 'Select * From users Where loggedIn=true';$stmt = mysql_prepare($query);mysql_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'i', $loggedIn);mysql_stmt_execute($stmt);$results = mysql_stmt_get_result($stmt);.... However, please note that the mysql extension is deprecated and should not be used in
