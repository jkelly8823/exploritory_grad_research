VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANANATION: The code is directly using the $_GET['username'] variable without any sanitization or validation. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the 'username' parameter in the URL.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example, you can use the PDO extension in PHP to prepare and execute SQL queries. Additionally, validate and sanitize user input to prevent any malicious code from being injected.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is directly echoing the user input without any sanitization or validation. This makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the 'username' parameter in the URL.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a function like htmlspecialchars() to escape any special characters in the user input. This will prevent any malicious JavaScript code from being injected. Additionally, validate and sanitize user input to prevent any malicious code from being injected.
