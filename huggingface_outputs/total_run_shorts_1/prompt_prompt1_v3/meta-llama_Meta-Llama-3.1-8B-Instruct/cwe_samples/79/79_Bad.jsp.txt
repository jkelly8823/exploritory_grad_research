VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code directly injects user input into the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding.
EXPLANATION: The code uses the `request.getParameter()` method to retrieve the "eid" parameter from the HTTP request and then directly embeds it into the HTML output using the JSP expression language (`<%= %>`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the "eid" parameter. For example, an attacker could send a request with the "eid" parameter set to `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would execute the malicious script when the page is rendered.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a proper encoding mechanism, such as the `org.apache.commons.lang.StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml()` method, to sanitize the user input before embedding it into the HTML output. Alternatively, the code could use a more secure approach, such as using a Java-based templating engine that supports automatic encoding of user input. Additionally, it's recommended to validate and sanitize all user input to
