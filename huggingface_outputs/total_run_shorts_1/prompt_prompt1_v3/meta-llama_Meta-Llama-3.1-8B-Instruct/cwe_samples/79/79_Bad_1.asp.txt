VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates user input (eid) into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the eid parameter. The use of string concatenation instead of parameterized queries makes the code susceptible to this type of attack.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation. For example, you can use the SqlCommand object with parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks. Here's an example of how to modify the code: string query = "select * from emp where id = @eid"; SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn); cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@eid", eid); sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd); sda.Fill(dt); string name = dt.Rows[0]["Name"]; EmployeeName.Text = name; This approach ensures that the user input is treated as a parameter, not part of the SQL code, thus preventing SQL injection attacks.
