VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This is because it directly uses user input from the $_COOKIE array without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The code directly uses the value of the "myname" cookie without any checks or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by setting the "myname" cookie to a value containing JavaScript code. For example, an attacker could set the "myname" cookie to "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" and the code would execute the JavaScript code, potentially leading to a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the user input from the $_COOKIE array. This can be done by using a whitelist approach, where only specific characters or patterns are allowed, or by using a library like HTML Purifier to sanitize the input. Additionally, the code should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. The code should also consider using a more secure method to store and retrieve user data, such as using a session or a secure cookie.
