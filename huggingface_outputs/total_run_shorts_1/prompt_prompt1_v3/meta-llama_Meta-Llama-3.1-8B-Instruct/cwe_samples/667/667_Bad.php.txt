VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a race condition when writing to the log file. This is because the flock() function is used to obtain an exclusive lock on the file, but the lock is released immediately after writing to the file. This allows another process to obtain the lock and overwrite the log file before the original process has a chance to write to it.
EXPLANATION: The flock() function is used to obtain an exclusive lock on the file, which prevents other processes from accessing the file until the lock is released. However, in this code, the lock is released immediately after writing to the file, which allows other processes to obtain the lock and overwrite the log file. This can lead to data loss and corruption.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the lock should be held until the end of the function, or until the log file is closed. This can be achieved by moving the flock($logfile, LOCK_UN) call to the end of the function, after the fclose($logFile) call. This ensures that the lock is held until the log file
