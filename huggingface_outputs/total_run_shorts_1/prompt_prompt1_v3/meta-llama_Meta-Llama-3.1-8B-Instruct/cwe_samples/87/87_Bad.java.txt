VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack. The `replaceAll` method does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
EXPLANATION: The `replaceAll` method is used to replace all occurrences of the string "script" with the provided mask. However, this method does not validate the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. For example, if the input is "<script>alert('XSS')</script>", the mask will be replaced with "<script>alert('XSS')</script>", effectively executing the malicious JavaScript code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a proper sanitization library or method, such as OWASP's ESAPI or a JavaScript library like DOMPurify, to sanitize the input before replacing it with the mask. Alternatively, use a more secure method like `String.replace()` instead of `replaceAll()`, which does not support regular expressions. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters or tags in the input.  ```java
public String preventXSS(String input, String mask) {
    // Use a sanitization library or method to sanitize the input
