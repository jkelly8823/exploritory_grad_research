VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential integer overflow vulnerability when calculating revenue for a quarter.
EXPLANATION: The `quarterSold` variable is calculated by adding three `long` variables together, but then passed to the `calculateRevenueForQuarter` function which likely expects a `long` value. However, if the sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by a `long`, it will overflow and wrap around to a smaller value, potentially causing incorrect results.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Change the type of the `quarterSold` variable to `long` to prevent integer overflow. Additionally, consider adding input validation to ensure that the sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `long`. This can be done by adding a simple check before passing the value to the `calculateRevenueForQuarter` function. For example: `if (quarterSold > Long.MAX_VALUE) { throw new IllegalArgumentException("Quarter sold value exceeds maximum limit"); }` before calling `calculateRevenueForQuarter(quarterSold);`.  ```c
