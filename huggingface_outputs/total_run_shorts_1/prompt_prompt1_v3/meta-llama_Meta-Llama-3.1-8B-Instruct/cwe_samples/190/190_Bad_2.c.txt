VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: This vulnerability occurs because the size of the buffer is not checked against the amount of data being read from the input. If the input data is larger than the buffer size, it will overflow the buffer, potentially causing the program to crash or execute malicious code. The `bytesRec` variable is used to keep track of the number of bytes read into the buffer, but it does not account for the possibility of a buffer overflow.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check if the `bytesRec` variable is less than the buffer size `SOMEBIGNUM` before reading more data into the buffer. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if `bytesRec + getFromInput(buf+bytesRec)` would exceed the buffer size, and if so, break out of the loop or return an error. Additionally, consider using a safer function to read data from the input, such as `fgets` or `readline`, which can handle buffer overflows more securely.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
