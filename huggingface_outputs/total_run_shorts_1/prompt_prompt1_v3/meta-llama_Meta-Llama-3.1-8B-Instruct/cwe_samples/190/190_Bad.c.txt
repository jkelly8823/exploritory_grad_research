VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of malloc to allocate memory for the table_ptr array without checking the return value.
EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory for the table_ptr array using malloc, but it does not check the return value of malloc. If malloc fails to allocate the requested memory, it will return NULL, and the subsequent assignment of the return value to table_ptr will result in a null pointer dereference. However, even if malloc is successful, the code does not check if the allocated memory is large enough to hold the array. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the allocated memory is smaller than expected.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The code should check the return value of malloc to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. Additionally, it should check the size of the allocated memory to ensure that it is large enough to hold the array. The recommended fix is to add a check for the return value of malloc and to use a loop to dynamically allocate the memory for the table_ptr array. For example:```c
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
if (table_ptr
