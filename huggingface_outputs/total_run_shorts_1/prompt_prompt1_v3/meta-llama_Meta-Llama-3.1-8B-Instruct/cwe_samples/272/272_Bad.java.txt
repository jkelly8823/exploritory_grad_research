VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the use of the AccessController.doPrivileged method. This method allows code to perform privileged operations, which can be exploited by malicious code.
EXPLANATION: The AccessController.doPrivileged method is used to perform privileged operations, such as loading a library, without the need for the code to have the necessary permissions. However, this can also be exploited by malicious code to gain unauthorized access to the system. In this case, the code is loading a library called "awt" which could potentially be used to execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should be reviewed to ensure that only necessary and trusted libraries are loaded. Additionally, the use of the AccessController.doPrivileged method should be avoided whenever possible. If the use of this method is necessary, then the code should be reviewed to ensure that it is being used correctly and that the necessary permissions are being checked. The code should also be reviewed to ensure that it is not loading any unnecessary or untrusted libraries.  The code should be refactored to use a more secure approach, such as using a
