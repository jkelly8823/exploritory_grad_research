 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code is vulnerable to a potential security risk due to the direct comparison of an event source with a hardcoded button reference. An attacker could potentially manipulate the event source to bypass this check and execute the code.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This is a classic example of a "clickjacking" vulnerability, where an attacker could trick the user into clicking on a malicious button, allowing them to access sensitive information.
EXPLANATION: The issue lies in the direct comparison of the event source with a hardcoded button reference. This makes it vulnerable to manipulation by an attacker. A more secure approach would be to use a more robust method to verify the source of the event, such as checking the event's command or action command.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, consider using a more secure approach to verify the source of the event, such as checking the event's command or action command. This can be achieved by using the `getActionCommand()` method to retrieve the command associated with the event, and then comparing it with the expected command. For example: `if (e.getActionCommand().equals("button"))`. Additionally, consider using a more secure way
