VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the use of an uninitialized variable 'i' in the outer loop. This can lead to accessing memory locations outside the bounds of the array 'connectivity_map_o'.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains a for loop that uses an uninitialized variable 'i' as the loop counter. This is problematic because the variable 'i' is not initialized before it is used, which can lead to unpredictable behavior when accessing the array 'connectivity_map_o'. Specifically, the loop may access memory locations outside the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, initialize the variable 'i' before using it as the loop counter. This can be done by adding the line 'i = 0' before the outer loop. Additionally, consider using a safer data structure, such as a vector, to store the connectivity map to prevent buffer overflows. Furthermore, ensure that the variable 'NBN_SUBORDINATE' is not modified during the execution of the loop to prevent further issues.
