VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly parses the accountID parameter from the request without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the accountID parameter.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use Prepared Statements: Instead of directly parsing the accountID parameter, use a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection. 
2. Validate and Sanitize Input: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious data from entering the system. 
3. Use a Whitelist Approach: Only allow specific characters or values in the accountID parameter to prevent SQL injection. 4. Avoid using Long.parseLong() to parse the accountID parameter, instead use a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions. 5. Consider using a library like OWASP ESAPI to help prevent SQL injection. 6. Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. 7. Use a secure way to get the user from the ID, such as using a secure database connection. 8. Consider using a library like Apache Commons Lang to help prevent SQL injection. 9. Always
