VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The function generateSessionID is vulnerable to a predictable session ID generation attack. This is because the srand function is seeded with the user ID, which can be guessed or brute-forced by an attacker. This allows an attacker to predict the session ID generated by the function.
EXPLANATION: The srand function is used to seed the random number generator. However, seeding it with the user ID makes it predictable. An attacker can use this predictability to generate the same session ID as the legitimate user. This can be used to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the srand function should be seeded with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) or a unique value that is not predictable. This can be achieved by using the random_int function, which is a CSPRNG, to seed the srand function. Alternatively, a unique value such as the current timestamp or a UUID can be used to seed the srand function. For example: srand(random_int(0, 1000000)); or srand(time()); or srand(uuid_create());. It is also recommended to use
