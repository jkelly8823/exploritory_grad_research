VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Predictable Random Number Generation
EXPLANATION: The use of a static seed for the Random class makes it predictable and vulnerable to attacks. An attacker can easily reproduce the same sequence of random numbers by using the same seed. This can lead to predictable and reproducible behavior in the application, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use a non-static seed or a secure random number generator, such as SecureRandom in Java, to generate truly random numbers. This will prevent an attacker from reproducing the same sequence of random numbers. Additionally, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) for generating account IDs.
