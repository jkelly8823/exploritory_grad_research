VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains two potential off-by-one vulnerabilities in the use of strncpy() function. This is because strncpy() does not null-terminate the destination string if the source string is shorter than the destination buffer size. This could lead to buffer overflows if the source string is longer than the destination buffer size.
EXPLANATION: The strncpy() function copies a string from the source to the destination, but it does not guarantee that the destination string will be null-terminated. If the source string is shorter than the destination buffer size, the remaining characters in the destination buffer will not be null-terminated, potentially leading to buffer overflows. In this code snippet, the use of strncpy() to copy the filename and pattern parameters to the Filename and Pattern variables, respectively, may cause off-by-one vulnerabilities if the source strings are longer than the destination buffer sizes.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix these vulnerabilities, the code should use the safer version of the strncpy() function, which is strncpy_s() in C99, or manually null-terminate the destination strings after copying the source strings. Additionally, the code should validate the lengths of the source strings to
