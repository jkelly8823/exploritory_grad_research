VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not check the length of the input before copying it to the buffer. The strncpy function is used, which prevents off-by-one overflows, but the subsequent manual assignment of a null terminator to the buffer still allows for a buffer overflow. This is because the manual assignment of a null terminator can overflow the buffer if the input string is longer than the buffer size minus one.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the code should check the length of the input before copying it to the buffer. This can be done by checking the length of the input string and ensuring it does not exceed the buffer size minus one. Additionally, the use of strncpy with a size parameter is a good practice, but the subsequent manual assignment of a null terminator should be avoided. Instead, the null terminator should be appended to the end of the string using the strncat function or by using the fgets function to read the input string and automatically append the null terminator. 

Note: The fgets function is a safer alternative to manual input handling and should be used when possible
