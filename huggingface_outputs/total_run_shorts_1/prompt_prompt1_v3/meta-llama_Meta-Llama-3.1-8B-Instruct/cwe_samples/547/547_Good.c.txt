VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The fgets function does not prevent buffer overflows when the input is longer than MAX_BUFFER_SIZE. If the user enters a string longer than 1024 characters, it will overflow the buffer and potentially cause a security breach.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use fgets with a smaller buffer size, or use a safer function like getline to prevent buffer overflows. Alternatively, use a dynamically allocated buffer to prevent fixed-size buffer overflows. Consider using a safer function like fgets_s or fgets_unlocked if available. Always validate user input to prevent buffer overflows.  Consider using a library like libmagic to detect the type of file being read and adjust the buffer size accordingly.
