 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to a hardcoded value for the data_in_security_level parameter, which is set to 1'b0 (secure) instead of 1'b1 (non-secure) as intended. This may lead to unintended behavior or security issues.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet instantiates a tz_peripheral module with a hardcoded value of 1'b0 for the data_in_security_level parameter. This is likely a copy-and-paste error or typo, as the comment suggests that 1'b0 represents secure data and 1'b1 represents non-secure data. However, the value is set to 1'b0, which would effectively promote all data to "secure", potentially leading to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the data_in_security_level parameter should be set to 1'b1 (non-secure) to match the intended behavior. This can be done by replacing the line `.data_in_security_level(1'b0)` with `.data_in_security_level(1'b1)`. Additionally, a code review should be performed to ensure that this is not a widespread issue in the code
