VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential memory leak due to the use of a sensitive resource (csr_regfile_i) without proper initialization or checking.
EXPLANATION: The csr_regfile_i port is being used without any initialization or checking. This could lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks if not properly handled.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Initialize csr_regfile_i before using it. Add checks to ensure it is properly configured before accessing its resources.
