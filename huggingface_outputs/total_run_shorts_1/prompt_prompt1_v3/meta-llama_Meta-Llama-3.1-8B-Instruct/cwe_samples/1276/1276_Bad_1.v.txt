VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the use of the wildcard (*) in the csr_regfile_i port map. This can lead to unintended connections and potential security breaches.
EXPLANATION: The use of the wildcard in the port map can cause the toolchain to automatically connect any unconnected ports of the csr_regfile module to the corresponding ports of the csr_regfile_i bus. This can result in unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. In a hardware design, this can be particularly problematic as it can lead to unexpected interactions between different components of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the developer should explicitly map each port of the csr_regfile module to the corresponding port of the csr_regfile_i bus. This can be done by replacing the wildcard (*) with the actual port names. For example, the port map should be modified to include explicit connections for each port, such as .flush_o (flush_csr_ctrl), .halt_csr_o (halt_csr_ctrl), ..., .irq_i(irq_i), .time_irq_i(time_irq_i), ... . This will ensure that the connections between the module and the bus are
