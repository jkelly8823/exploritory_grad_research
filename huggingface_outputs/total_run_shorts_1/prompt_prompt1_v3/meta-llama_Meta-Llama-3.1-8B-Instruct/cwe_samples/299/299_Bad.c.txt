 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to a possible null pointer dereference. The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))` assigns the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to `cert` instead of comparing it. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` returns NULL.
EXPLANATION: The issue here is that the single equals sign `=` is being used for assignment instead of comparison. In C, a single equals sign is used for assignment, while a double equals sign `==` is used for comparison. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes if the value being assigned is NULL. In this case, if `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` returns NULL, the `cert` variable will be NULL, and attempting to access it will result in a null pointer dereference.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, replace the single equals sign `=` with a double equals sign `==` to correctly compare the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to NULL. The corrected line should read `if (cert == SSL_get_peer
