VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `strcpy` function. This is because the `strcpy` function does not perform bounds checking on the destination buffer, allowing an attacker to overflow the buffer with user-controlled input.
EXPLANATION: The `strcpy` function is a classic example of a function that is vulnerable to buffer overflows. When the `strcpy` function is called with a destination buffer that is too small to hold the source string, it will continue to copy characters beyond the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent variables or even the return address on the stack. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. In this case, the `strcpy` function is being called with a destination buffer that is only 256 bytes in size, but the source string is user-controlled and can be arbitrarily large.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the `strcpy` function should be replaced with a safer function such as `strncpy` that performs bounds checking on the destination buffer. Alternatively, the code can be modified to use a safer function such as `snprintf` that allows for explicit control over
