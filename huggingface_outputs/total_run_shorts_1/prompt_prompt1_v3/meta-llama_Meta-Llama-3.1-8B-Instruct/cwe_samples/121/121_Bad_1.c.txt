VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking on the hostname variable, and potential buffer overflow due to the use of strcpy in the face of potential null pointer dereferences.
EXPLANATION: 
The function host_lookup() does not perform any bounds checking on the hostname variable, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the hostname is longer than the allocated space. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow vulnerability. Furthermore, the use of strcpy() on the hostname variable without checking if hp->h_name is null can lead to a null pointer dereference, which is also a vulnerability. The function validate_addr_form() does not provide any protection against this issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use strncpy() instead of strcpy() to prevent buffer overflow. 
2. Check if hp->h_name is null before copying it to the hostname variable. 
3. Allocate a larger buffer for the hostname variable to accommodate longer hostnames. 
4. Use a safer function like strdup() to copy the hostname variable, which can handle null pointers. 
5. Consider using a safer function like gethostbyname() which can handle null pointers and
