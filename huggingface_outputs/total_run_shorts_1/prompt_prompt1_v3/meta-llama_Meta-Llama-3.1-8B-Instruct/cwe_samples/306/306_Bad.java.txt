VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability due to the direct use of user input in the creation of a BankAccount object.
EXPLANATION: The createBankAccount method directly uses user input for the accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, and balance parameters. This makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating these parameters, allowing them to access or modify sensitive data.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the method should be modified to sanitize or validate the user input before using it to create a BankAccount object. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input. Additionally, the method should be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other potential vulnerabilities.  The accountNumber and accountType should be validated to ensure they match the expected format. The accountName and accountSSN should be validated to ensure they match the expected format. The balance should be validated to ensure it is within the expected range.  The method should also be reviewed to ensure that it does not contain any other potential vulnerabilities.
