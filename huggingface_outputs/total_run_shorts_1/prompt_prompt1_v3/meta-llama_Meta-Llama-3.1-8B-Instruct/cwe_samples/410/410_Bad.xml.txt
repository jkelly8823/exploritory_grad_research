VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The password is hardcoded in the configuration file, which is a security risk. This allows an attacker to obtain the password if they gain access to the configuration file.
EXPLANATION: Hardcoding passwords in configuration files is a common security risk. If an attacker gains access to the configuration file, they can obtain the password and use it to gain unauthorized access to the database. This can be mitigated by using environment variables or a secrets management system to store sensitive information like passwords.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Use environment variables or a secrets management system to store the password. This can be done by replacing the hardcoded password with a reference to an environment variable or a secrets management system. For example, you can use the `spring.datasource.password` property to store the password in an environment variable. Alternatively, you can use a secrets management system like Hashicorp's Vault to store the password securely.  ```xml
<property name="spring.datasource.password" value="${DB_PASSWORD}"/>
```  ```  ```xml
<property name="spring.datasource.password" value="${DB_PASSWORD}"/>
```  ```  ```xml
<property name="spring.datasource.password" value="${
