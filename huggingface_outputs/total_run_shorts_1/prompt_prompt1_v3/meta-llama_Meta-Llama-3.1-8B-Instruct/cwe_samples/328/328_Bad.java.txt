 

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a timing attack due to the use of a timing-dependent equality check between the digest and the secret password.
EXPLANATION: The code uses a timing-dependent equality check by calling the `digest()` method on the `password` object, which may take longer to execute if the digest does not match the secret password. This allows an attacker to measure the time it takes to execute the `digest()` method and infer information about the secret password.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, use a constant-time equality check, such as using a library like `java.util.Arrays.equals()` or implementing a custom constant-time equality check. Additionally, consider using a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to store and verify passwords.
