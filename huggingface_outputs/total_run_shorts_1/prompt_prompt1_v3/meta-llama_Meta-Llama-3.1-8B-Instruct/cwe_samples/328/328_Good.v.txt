VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a potential race condition due to the use of a shared variable 'pass_mode' in a non-atomic manner.
EXPLANATION: The 'pass_mode' variable is being read and written in a non-atomic manner, which can lead to a race condition if multiple threads or processes are accessing this variable simultaneously. This can cause the code to produce unexpected results or behave erratically.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the 'pass_mode' variable should be protected with a mutex or other synchronization mechanism to ensure that only one thread or process can access it at a time. Alternatively, the code can be restructured to avoid shared variables and use a more thread-safe approach. Additionally, the use of a non-atomic variable in a critical section of the code is a potential issue and should be addressed.  The code should be reviewed to ensure that all shared variables are properly synchronized.
