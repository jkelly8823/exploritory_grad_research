VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The vulnerability is a potential SQL injection attack due to the use of a user-supplied input (dollar amount) without proper sanitization or validation.
EXPLANATION: The dollarToYen method takes a BigDecimal object as input, which is then multiplied by the yenRate. However, if the input is not a valid BigDecimal, it could potentially lead to a SQL injection attack. This is because the input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the input should be validated and sanitized before being used in the calculation. This can be done by using a try-catch block to catch any NumberFormatExceptions that may occur when parsing the input. Additionally, the input should be checked to ensure it is a valid BigDecimal object before being used in the calculation. This can be done by using the isInstance() method to check if the input is an instance of BigDecimal. If the input is not a valid BigDecimal, an error message should be returned to the user. 

Note: The vulnerability is not actually a SQL injection attack, but rather a potential issue with the use of user
