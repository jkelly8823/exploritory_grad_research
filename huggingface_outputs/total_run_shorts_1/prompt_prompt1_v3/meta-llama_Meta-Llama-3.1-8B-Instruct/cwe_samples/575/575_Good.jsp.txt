VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack due to the use of the InitialContext class to look up the Converter bean. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the application.
EXPLANATION: The InitialContext class is used to look up the Converter bean, which is a remote object. However, the InitialContext class can be used to inject arbitrary code into the application, allowing an attacker to execute remote code. This is a classic example of a RCE vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: To fix this vulnerability, the application should use a more secure method to look up the Converter bean, such as using a dependency injection framework or a secure naming context. Additionally, the application should validate and sanitize any user input to prevent injection attacks. The code should be modified to use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the lookup process, and to log any errors that occur. The code should also be modified to use a secure method to convert the amount to Yen, such as using a secure conversion library. 

Note: The vulnerability is present on line 14, where the InitialContext class is used to
