## Vulnerability Analysis 

**VULNERABLE:** YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 4-10, 16-20
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:**  The code stores hardcoded credentials (`username` and `password`) and uses insecure string comparison functions (`strncmp` with `strlen`) in the `AuthenticateUser` function. This makes the application vulnerable to attacks like credential theft and brute-force attacks.

**EXPLANATION:**

1. **Hardcoded Credentials:** Line 5 stores the username and password as plain text strings. This is extremely insecure as anyone accessing the code can directly see the credentials.

2. **Insecure String Comparison:** Lines 7 and 9 use `strncmp` with `strlen` to compare user input with the hardcoded credentials. This is vulnerable because:
    *  It relies on `strlen`, which provides the length of a string, without considering potential buffer overflows. 
    * It doesn't properly validate the input length before comparison, making it susceptible to attacks.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Use Environment Variables or a Configuration File:**

   Store credentials securely in environment variables or a configuration file. This separates sensitive information from the source code.

2. **Implement Proper Input Validation:**

   Validate the length and format of user input before comparison. Sanitize user input to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

3. **Use Secure Password Hashing:**

   Instead of storing passwords in plain text, hash them using a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) before storage.

4. **Employ a Password Manager:**

   Consider using a password manager or a key vault to securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys and passwords.

5. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure best practices are followed.

**ORIGINAL CODE:**

```c
/* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. */
char *username = "admin";
char *pass = "password";
int AuthenticateUser(char *inUser, char *inPass) {
 if (strncmp(username, inUser, strlen(inUser))) {
   logEvent("Auth failure of username using strlen of inUser");
   return(AUTH_FAIL);
 }
 if (!strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {
   logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");
   return(AUTH_SUCCESS);
 } else {
   logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");
   return(AUTH_FAIL);
 }
}
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
  int authResult;
  if (argc < 3) {
    ExitError("Usage: Provide a username and password");
  }
  authResult = AuthenticateUser(argv[1], argv[2]);
  if (authResult == AUTH_SUCCESS) {
    DoAuthenticatedTask(argv[1]);
  } else {
    ExitError("Authentication failed");
  }
}
