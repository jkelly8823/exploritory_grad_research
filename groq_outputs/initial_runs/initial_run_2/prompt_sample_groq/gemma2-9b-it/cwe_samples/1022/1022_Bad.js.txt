VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential

EXPLANATION: 

The code directly uses user-provided input (`attacker-site.example.com`) to construct the URL for opening a new window. This creates a vulnerability where a malicious actor could inject harmful JavaScript code into the URL. 

If a user could control the value of `"http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html"`, they could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the new window, leading to XSS attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Never trust user input directly. Before constructing the URL, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters or code. You can use a library or function designed for URL sanitization.

2. **Encode URLs:** Encode the URL properly to prevent the browser from interpreting user-supplied data as code.  



ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
```
