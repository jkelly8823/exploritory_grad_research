VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential

EXPLANATION: 
The code opens a new window to a potentially malicious website (`http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html`).  There's a risk that this website could inject malicious JavaScript into the new window. If the user interacts with content on this attacker-controlled site, their browser could execute the malicious code, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Never directly use user-supplied data in the `window.open` URL.  Always sanitize any user input that might be part of a URL before embedding it. Libraries like DOMPurify can help with this.

2. **Be Cautious with Open Windows:** Exercise extreme caution when opening windows to external websites. Consider using a secure communication protocol (HTTPS) for any external links and only use trusted URLs.
3. **Limit Information Leakage:**  The `newWindow.opener = null;` line prevents the new window from being able to refer back to the original window (which could be used for some attacks).  However, be aware that information leakage can still occur through other methods if the attacker-controlled site is malicious.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
newWindow.opener = null; 
```
