VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unvalidated Redirect
EXPLANATION:
This code contains a vulnerability known as an unvalidated redirect. An attacker can manipulate the link by changing the "href" attribute to redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities. The vulnerability arises from the lack of validation or sanitization of user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious URLs.

The code itself does not directly inject a malicious URL; however, without proper input validation or sanitization elsewhere in the codebase, the possibility remains. Given this scenario, the link "href" still poses a vulnerability due to the external nature of the link.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid using external URLs directly in the "href" attribute. If external URLs are necessary, consider implementing the following measures:
- Validate and sanitize any user input that may be used in generating the URL.
- Consider using a whitelisting approach, where a predefined set of trusted URLs are allowed.
- Use a URL parsing library to ensure the URL is properly formatted and originated from a trusted domain.
