VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate form name in the same formset.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a formset with two forms that have the same name ("ProjectForm"). This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. In many web frameworks, forms are identified by their names, and having duplicate names can lead to conflicts. This can allow an attacker to exploit the application's behavior by manipulating the form data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use unique names for each form within the formset. This will ensure that the application can differentiate between the two forms and process their data correctly.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                 <form-validation>
                 
                   <formset>
                   
                     <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
                     <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
                   
                   </formset>
                 
                 </form-validation>
