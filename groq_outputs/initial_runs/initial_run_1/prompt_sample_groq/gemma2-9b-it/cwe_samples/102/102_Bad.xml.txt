VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Code Duplication
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code demonstrates a vulnerability due to code duplication. Specifically, there are two identical `<form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>` elements within the `<formset>`. This duplication suggests potential issues in the application's logic and can lead to unintended consequences. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Remove the duplicate `form` element:**  Ensure that there is only one `<form name="ProjectForm">` element within the `<formset>`. This will streamline the code and prevent potential conflicts or inconsistencies.
2. **Review the purpose of the duplication:**  Understand why two `form` elements with the same name were initially included. If they serve distinct purposes, refactor the code to use separate form names or identifiers. 3. **Consider using a template engine:**   If this code is part of a larger application, utilize a template engine to dynamically generate the `<form>` elements based on data or logic, avoiding manual duplication.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
				   
				   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
				 
               
               ```
