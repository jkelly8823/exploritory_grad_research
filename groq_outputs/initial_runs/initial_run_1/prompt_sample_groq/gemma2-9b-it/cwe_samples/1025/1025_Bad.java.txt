VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: String comparison using `==` operator

EXPLANATION:

The code snippet compares two String objects, `str1` and `str2`, using the equality operator (`==`). In Java, the `==` operator checks for object reference equality, meaning it compares whether two variables point to the same object in memory.  

Since `str1` and `str2` are created using `new String("Hello")`, they are allocated distinct memory locations, even though they hold the same string value. Therefore, the condition `str1 == str2` will always evaluate to false.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Use the `.equals()` method to compare the content of the strings:

 ```java
 String str1 = new String("Hello");
 String str2 = new String("Hello");
 if (str1.equals(str2)) {
     System.out.println("str1 == str2");
 }
 ```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  String str1 = new String("Hello");String str2 = new String("Hello");if (str1 == str2) {System.out.println("str1 == str2");}
```



Let me know if you have any other code snippets you would like me to evaluate!
