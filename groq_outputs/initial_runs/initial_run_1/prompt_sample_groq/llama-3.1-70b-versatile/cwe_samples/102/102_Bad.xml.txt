VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate form name in the same form set.

EXPLANATION:
The HTML specification does not explicitly prohibit duplicate form names, but it can lead to unexpected behavior when attempting to reference or manipulate these forms in JavaScript. Having multiple forms with the same name can result in confusion, errors, or unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use unique names for each form in the same form set. This will prevent any potential conflicts and ensure that JavaScript functionality targeting these forms works as expected. Here is an example of how the corrected code might look:

```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
