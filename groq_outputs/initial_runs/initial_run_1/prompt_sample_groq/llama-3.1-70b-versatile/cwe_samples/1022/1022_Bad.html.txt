VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Cross-Site Request (CSR) or Phishing Attack

EXPLANATION:
The given HTML code snippet contains an anchor tag with a target attribute set to "_blank". This can potentially lead to a Cross-Site Request (CSR) or phishing attack. If the user trusts the current site and doesn't notice that the link is opening in a new tab, they might be tricked into submitting sensitive information to the attacker's site.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent such attacks, consider implementing the following measures:

* Use rel="noopener" attribute to prevent the new tab from accessing the opener's window object.

```html
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
```

* Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to specify which sources are allowed to make requests.

* Avoid using "_blank" whenever possible. If you really need to open a link in a new tab, consider creating a new window programmatically and setting the src attribute of the new window to the desired URL.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```html
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
