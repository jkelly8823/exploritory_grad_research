VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a vulnerability related to the Window Open (TABnabbing) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `window.open()` function is used to open a new browser window with the URL 'http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html'. However, this URL is hardcoded and could potentially be malicious. Attackers could manipulate the link to redirect victims to phishing sites, spread malware, or steal user data. Additionally, modern web browsers have made target='blank` links open in new tabs by default, however the vulnerability here is related to how some older browsers render window.open.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we recommend implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the webpage can load content. The following lines can be added inside the webpage header's HTTP response:


<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';>

If you have the control over this 'new window' page then we can also implement checks inside the newWindow to check source page and only load content when you can verify it's trusted origin.

It is also recommended to check URL content before opening the new window and ensure that it is coming from a trusted source.

Avoid hardcoding URLs and considering storing URLs securely (https support preferably).

Use try/catch blocks to catch any security exceptions your webpage throw.

 Be cautious in which variables a URL is collected from and attempt to perform proper syntax validation (using `|| <some URL part>` that may reveal attackers).

Also it might not be best practice for best inline user experience however URL with http is not allowed in google play policies and require proper (https protocols always). Also to also assist for maximum trust by your domain provide meta information so you're telling your link location about.

When constructing new windows which also would lead you to a higher usability such a construct parameter which would provide a relative URL (./sub, `site url`, https will also guide your users).

All of these variations ensure that https are there especially no user data found in redirects using this redirect.


ORIGINAL CODE:

var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
