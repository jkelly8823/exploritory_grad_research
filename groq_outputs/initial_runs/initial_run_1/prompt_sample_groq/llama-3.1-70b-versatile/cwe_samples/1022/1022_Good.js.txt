VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `window.opener` property is set to `null`, which can be used to bypass pop-up blocking restrictions.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment opens a new window with a URI and sets the `opener` property to `null`. This is a known vulnerability where an attacker can bypass pop-up blocking restrictions in certain browsers. When the `window.opener` property is set, it typically breaks the relationship between the pop-up window and its parent. However, by setting it to `null`, an attacker can disguise the pop-up window as a legitimate one, making it harder for browsers to detect and block malicious pop-ups.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the `window.opener` property should not be set to `null`. Instead, consider using alternatives like the `noopener` attribute when creating a new window to prevent access to the parent window.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");newWindow.opener = null;
```

Here is a revised secure code example:

```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank", "noopener noreferrer");
```

In the revised example, the `noopener` attribute ensures that the opened window has no access to its parent window, mitigating the vulnerability.
