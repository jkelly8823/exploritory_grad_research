VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate form names.  

EXPLANATION:

A potential vulnerability exists because two `<form>` elements within the `<formset>` have the same name, "ProjectForm."  In HTML, forms need unique names to be correctly submitted and processed. Having duplicate names can lead to unexpected behavior, such as one form's data overwriting the other's, or errors during form submission.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Rename Duplicate Forms:** Give each `<form>` element a distinct name. For example, you could use "ProjectForm1," "ProjectForm2," etc.

2. **Consider Alternatives:**  If the forms are logically related and need to be submitted together, explore using a single form with multiple sections or fields instead of separate forms. This can simplify form handling and reduce the risk of naming conflicts.
