VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Comparing Strings using == operator

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet utilizes the equality operator (`==`) to compare two String objects, `str1` and `str2`.  However, this is incorrect. The `==` operator checks if two object references point to the same memory location, not if their content is equal. 

In this case, although the strings have the same content ("Hello"), they are created separately and stored in different memory locations. Thus, the comparison `str1 == str2` will return `false`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  
To compare the content of String objects, use the `.equals()` method:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");
if (str1.equals(str2)) { 
   System.out.println("str1 == str2"); 
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String str1 = new String("Hello");String str2 = new String("Hello");if (str1 == str2) {System.out.println("str1 == str2");}


```
