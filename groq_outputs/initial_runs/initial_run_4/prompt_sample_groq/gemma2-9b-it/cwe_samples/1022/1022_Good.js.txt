VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential

EXPLANATION:
The code opens a new window to a potentially malicious URL (`http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html`). If the content of `useful-page.html` contains JavaScript code, it could be injected into the new window and executed in the context of the user's browser. This allows an attacker to potentially steal user data, hijack sessions, or redirect the user to other malicious sites.

Additionally, setting `newWindow.opener = null;` prevents the opened window from being associated with the original window, making it harder to detect and prevent attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize the URL:** rigorously validate and sanitize the URL before opening it in a new window. This should involve escaping or encoding any potentially dangerous characters.

* **Use a whitelisting approach:**  instead of allowing all URLs, define a whitelist of permitted domains and only open windows for URLs that match.
* **Consider using URL parameters:** When passing data to `useful-page.html`, use URL parameters instead of directly embedding data in the URL. This makes it harder for attackers to manipulate the data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");newWindow.opener = null;
 ;
