VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Not specifically applicable as it's an HTML attribute
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to phishing or malicious site redirection attacks via a potentially untrusted 'target' attribute set on an anchor tag. However, this vulnerability stems from the broader HTML, likely from the parent application context serving linked external sources.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the 'target' attribute set to "_blank" on an anchor tag. Modern web development best practices advise setting both 'noopener' and 'noreferrer' attributes on any anchor tags with 'target="_blank"', in order to limit external applications that may have elevated access. Without setting 'noopener', malicious sites linked in this fashion may have a potential to become available to your users' browsing contexts.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Prefer 'noopener', 'noreferrer' alongside 'target' on applicable HTML anchor tags:

<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
