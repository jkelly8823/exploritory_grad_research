Insecure Session Management: Insecure Session ID Generation

EXPLANATION:
The provided code generates a session ID using the `generateSessionId()` method and stores it in a cookie. However, the code does not specify how the session ID is generated, and there is no indication that the session ID is being securely generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).

If the session ID is not generated securely, it may be predictable or easily guessable, allowing an attacker to hijack a user's session and gain unauthorized access to the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a CSPRNG to generate the session ID. Examples of secure session ID generation can be seen in languages like Java, where the `java.security.SecureRandom` class can be used to generate random numbers.

2. Use a secure algorithm to generate the session ID. For example, a cryptographically secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 can be used in combination with a secret key to generate the session ID.

3. Consider using a well-established library or framework that provides secure session management functionality, such as a Java Servlet or a modern web framework like Spring.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
response.addCookie(c);
```
