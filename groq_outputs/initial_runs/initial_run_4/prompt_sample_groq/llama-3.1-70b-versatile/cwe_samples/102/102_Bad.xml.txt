VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate Form Identifier
EXPLANATION:
The provided HTML code contains two forms with the same name "ProjectForm" inside the same formset. This can cause issues when handling form submissions, as JavaScript and other programming languages may not be able to differentiate between the two forms. Using duplicate form identifiers can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities, especially when validating form data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that each form has a unique name or identifier. You can use different names for the forms, such as "ProjectForm1" and "ProjectForm2", or use a different attribute (e.g., "id") to uniquely identify each form.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```
Recommended fixed code:
```
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```
