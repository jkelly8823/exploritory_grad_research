VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The `rel` attribute does not include the `noopener` attribute is used in conjunction with `target="_blank"`, however it is noted that the noreferrer is present. However potential vulnerability occurs with 'noopener' lacking in older browsers.


However issue is in href link. The link address 'http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html' can be malicous. Following any action without review can cause unintended effects.


EXPLANATION:
If an attacker controls the origin of the linked resource, they can manipulate the referrer to originate from the current page. Also for  `rel="noopener"`, some older browsers only have minimal support while some browser completely support it so without support a window can be hijacked.


If an attacker controls the link address by which site a user goes to, a website could be compromised.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid such vulnerability an alternative for opener is to specify `"noopener"` and `"noreferrer"` together to avoid running in older browsers. However since older browser support for `"noopener"` and `"noreferrer"` will be the fault it seems you have added both which in good practice.


The link address should be reviewed and controlled.

ORIGINAL CODE:

<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
