VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate Form Names

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains two forms with the same name, 'ProjectForm'. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities when handling form data, especially when working with server-side scripting. Duplicate form names can cause issues with JavaScript functions and event handlers, and may also cause problems when trying to access or manipulate form elements.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the name attribute of one of the forms to a unique value. This can help prevent potential issues with duplicate form names.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
				 
To fix this vulnerability, you can modify the code as follows:


                   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
				 

Alternatively, if both forms serve the same purpose and can be combined into one, consider removing the second form or merging its content into the first one.
