VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (the vulnerability is not inherent in this code but it can still be exploited)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses 'rel="noopener noreferrer"' in the 'a' tag but still has a minor vulnerability without additional attribute that blocks tabnabbing attacks. The anchor tag also lacks protection against external resource inclusion and external website attribute based vulnerabilities.


EXPLANATION:
This issue occurs because 'noopener noreferrer' only works in conjunction with '_blank' when there's also a certain 'noopener' keyword in the 'target' but defined as an attribute of the anchor tag and is better protected when defined in the '_blank' frame when defined with 'target'_blank' 'rel' pair in anchor 'a' tag not directly with the tag. This, however, makes the anchor tag vulnerable because it does allow an unscrupulous attacker, limited control of the 'name' or the 'url' or both attributes in place of the trusted and webmaster vetted value in case the information isn't taken from code variables .


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To further avoid tab-nabbing vulnerabilities or browser hijacking - consider setting both the rel attribute and the attribute of referrerpolicy to values protecting this new '_blank frame 'new external window frame' attribute pair from causing unforeseen tab-openings.
2. An additional option would be to prevent popups in general by asking for user input permission i.e. opening links in the user’s current browser origin or providing them choices on external linked referenced or not if applicable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
```

Here is the recommended corrected version in order to mitigate potential tab-nabbing attacks:

 ```
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
```
