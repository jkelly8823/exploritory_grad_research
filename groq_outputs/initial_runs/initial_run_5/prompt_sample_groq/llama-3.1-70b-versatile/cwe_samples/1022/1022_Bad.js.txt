VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
XSS via window.open() function with untrusted URL.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists because the `window.open()` function is being used with an untrusted URL. An attacker may inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, potentially leading to an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. The URL passed to `window.open()` should be validated and sanitized to prevent any malicious code from being executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Validate and sanitize the URL before passing it to `window.open()`. Consider using a library or function to check for malicious patterns in the URL. Also, consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");

Recommended sample fix:

```javascript
const validUrlPattern = /^https?:\/\/[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/; // simple regex pattern to check for valid URLs
const url = "http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html";

if (validUrlPattern.test(url)) {
  var newWindow = window.open(url, "_blank");
} else {
  console.error("Invalid or malicious URL detected.");
}
```
