VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing field comparison in equals method. The equals method does not compare  the `year` field of the `Truck` objects. 
EXPLANATION:  
The `equals` method is used to check if two objects are equal.  For `Truck` objects, it's likely that the `year` field is also a crucial part of determining equality. The current implementation only compares `make` and `model`, potentially leading to situations where two `Truck` objects with different years are considered equal. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, add a comparison for the `year` field within the `equals` method:

```java
 public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == null) return false;
    if (o == this) return true;
    if (!(o instanceof Truck)) return false;

    Truck t = (Truck) o;
    return (this.make.equals(t.make) && this.model.equals(t.model) && this.year == t.year);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  public class Truck {
                        private String make;private String model;private int year;
                           public boolean equals(Object o) {
                              if (o == null) return false;if (o == this) return true;if (!(o instanceof Truck)) return false;
                                 Truck t = (Truck) o;
                                 return (this.make.equals(t.getMake()) && this.model.equals(t.getModel()));
                           }
                     }
               
               
```
