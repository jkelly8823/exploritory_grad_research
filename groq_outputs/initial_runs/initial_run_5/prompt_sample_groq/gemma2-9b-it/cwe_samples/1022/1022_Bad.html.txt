VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential XSS vulnerability.  An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `href` attribute of the anchor tag. 

The attacker could potentially exploit this by modifying the link to something like:

`<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
<script>alert('XSS attack!')</script>
</a>`

When a user clicks this link, their browser would execute the injected JavaScript, potentially allowing the attacker to steal user data, hijack sessions, or deface the website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize user-supplied input:** Never directly embed user-supplied data into HTML attributes.  

   Use appropriate input sanitization techniques to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before including them in the HTML output.

2. **Encode special characters:**

   Encode problematic characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'`  to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML markup. This can be done using HTML encoding functions provided by your programming language or framework.
3. **Use a template engine:** Employ a template engine that automatically escapes data to mitigate XSS risks.
