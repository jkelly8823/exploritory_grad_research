## Code Analysis 

**VULNERABLE**: YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES**: Line 1
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential

**EXPLANATION**:  

The provided code snippet opens a new window using `window.open()`, targeting a URL that appears controlled by an attacker (`http://attacker-site.example.com`). This presents a risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 

If the attacker-controlled website  inject malicious scripts into the `useful-page.html`, these scripts could potentially execute in the context of the user's browser when the new window is opened. This could allow the attacker to steal user data, hijack sessions, or redirect the user to other malicious sites.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:

* **Sanitize user-supplied URLs:** Before using `window.open()`, ensure the URL is sanitized to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. This can involve using a whitelist of allowed domains or escaping special characters.
* **Consider using a safer alternative:** Instead of `window.open()`, explore safer alternatives like using an iframe or redirecting the user to the intended page within the current window (if appropriate).

**ORIGINAL CODE:**

```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");   
```
