VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate Form Names 

EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains two `<form>` elements within the `<formset>` both with the same name attribute "ProjectForm".  HTML forms with identical names will conflict, as only one form with a given name can be submitted at a time. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially prevent data from being submitted correctly. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   Change the `name` attribute of one of the `<form>` elements to a unique identifier. This could be a variation like "ProjectForm2" or something more descriptive.
*   If both forms are intended to be submitted simultaneously, consider using a more appropriate method such as AJAX or a different form structure (e.g., a single form with multiple separate sections).




ORIGINAL CODE:

<form-validation>               
 <formset>
 
  <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  
 </formset>
 
</form-validation>
