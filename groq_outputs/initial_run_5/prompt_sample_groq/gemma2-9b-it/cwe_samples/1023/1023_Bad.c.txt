VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-12

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  

The code uses hard-coded credentials for username and password ("admin" and "password"), making it highly vulnerable to attacks. 

EXPLANATION:

The `AuthenticateUser` function compares the entered username and password against fixed strings stored in the variables `username` and `pass`. This is a serious security flaw known as **hardcoding credentials**. 

* **Exposure:** An attacker can easily discover these credentials by inspecting the code.
* **No Protection:** There is no encryption or secure storage for the passwords. Any access to the code exposes the password in plain text.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Never Hardcode Credentials:**  Do not store sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly in the source code.
2. **Use Secure Storage:**  Utilize environment variables, configuration files, or dedicated secret management systems to store credentials securely.
3. **Input Validation:** Validate user input to ensure it meets expected formats and lengths.
4. **Hashing:**  Store passwords as hashed values instead of plain text. Use strong, cryptographically secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
5. **Salt:** Always use a unique salt value when hashing passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
    /* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. */
    
    char *username = "admin";char *pass = "password";
    int AuthenticateUser(char *inUser, char *inPass) {
    if (strncmp(username, inUser, strlen(inUser))) {
      logEvent("Auth failure of username using strlen of inUser");
      return(AUTH_FAIL);
    }
    if (! strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {
      logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");
      return(AUTH_SUCCESS);
    }
    else {
      logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");
      return(AUTH_FAIL);
    }
  }
    int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    int authResult;
    if (argc < 3) {
      ExitError("Usage: Provide a username and password");
    }
    authResult = AuthenticateUser(argv[1], argv[2]);
    if (authResult == AUTH_SUCCESS) {
      DoAuthenticatedTask(argv[1]);
    }
    else {
      ExitError("Authentication failed");
    }
  }
