VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Keystore Password Retrieval
EXPLANATION: 
The code retrieves the keystore password from a system property `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword`. This approach poses a security risk because the password is not explicitly defined within the code itself.  An attacker could potentially manipulate the system property at runtime, gaining access to sensitive cryptographic keys.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Do not rely on environment variables or system properties for storing sensitive data like passwords.**
* **Encrypt the keystore password and store it securely.** 
* **Use a dedicated secure configuration management system.**
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String keystorePass = System.getProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword");
if (keystorePass == null) {
  System.err.println("ERROR: Keystore password not specified.");
  System.exit(-1);
}
```
