VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Out-of-Bounds Array Access
EXPLANATION: 

The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability related to out-of-bounds array access. The expression `array1[x] * 4096` could result in an index that exceeds the bounds of `array2` if `x` takes on a value close to `array1_size`.  

Here's why:

* **Unbounded Multiplication:**  Multiplying `array1[x]` by 4096 can quickly lead to very large indices, especially if `array1[x]` is significant. 
* **Potential for Overflow:** If `array1_size` itself is close to the maximum value an index can hold,  `x` could be slightly less than `array1_size` but still result in an index that's out of bounds for `array2`.

Impact: Accessing elements outside the bounds of an array leads to buffer overflows or segmentation faults, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Bounds Checking:**  Add explicit bounds checks before accessing `array2`. 
   ```c
   if (x < array1_size && array1[x] * 4096 < array2_size) { 
       y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];
   } else {
       // Handle the out-of-bounds case, e.g., log an error or return a default value.
   }
   ```

2. **Input Validation:** If `x` is received from an external source, validate its range to ensure it's within acceptable bounds for `array1_size`.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
						if (x < array1_size)
							y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];
