VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential
EXPLANATION:

The `<script>` tag dynamically loading content from `externalDomain.example.com/weatherwidget.js` presents a potential XSS vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate the content of this external JavaScript file to inject malicious code that could be executed in the user's browser. This could lead to various attacks, such as stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, or redirecting them to malicious websites.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize user input:**  Before including any user-provided data in a `<script>` tag, sanitize it carefully to remove any potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript code.  Use a library designed for input sanitization.
2. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load scripts, effectively mitigating the risk of XSS attacks from external domains.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<div class="header"> Welcome!<div id="loginBox">Please Login:<form id ="loginForm" name="loginForm" action="login.php" method="post">Username: <input type="text" name="username" /><br/>Password: <input type="password" name="password" /><input type="submit" value="Login" /></form></div><div id="WeatherWidget"><script type="text/javascript" src="externalDomain.example.com/weatherwidget.js"></script></div></div> 
```
