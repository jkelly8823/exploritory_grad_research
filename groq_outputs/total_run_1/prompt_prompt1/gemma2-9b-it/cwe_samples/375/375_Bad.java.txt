VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Array-based buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code defines a `patientList` array with a fixed size of 50. There is no check to ensure that the number of patients added to the list does not exceed this size. If more than 50 patients are added, it can lead to an array-based buffer overflow. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by adding a large number of patients, leading to data corruption or even arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 - Use a `List` or `ArrayList` instead of a fixed-size array to allow for dynamic resizing.
 - Implement bounds checking when adding patients to the list to prevent exceeding the maximum capacity.




ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  public class ClinicalTrial {private PatientClass[] patientList = new PatientClass[50];public getPatients(...){return patientList;}}
