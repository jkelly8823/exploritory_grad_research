VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `getInputPath()` to determine the file path, which likely comes from user input.  Without proper validation, an attacker could provide a path like `../../etc/passwd` to access files outside the intended `safe_dir` directory.  This is a classic directory traversal vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Validate and sanitize the `getInputPath()` input before using it.  Remove any characters that could be used for directory traversal (e.g., "..", "/").  
2. **Whitelist Allowed Paths:** Consider using a whitelist of allowed paths instead of relying solely on checking the starting directory.  
3. **Use a Safer File Handling Approach:** Explore alternatives that minimize the risk of directory traversal, such as using a library that handles path manipulation safely (e.g., Apache Commons Lang).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String path = getInputPath();
                  File f = new File(path);
                  if (f.getCanonicalPath().startsWith("/safe_dir/")){
                      return f.getCanonicalPath();
                  }                  
               ```
