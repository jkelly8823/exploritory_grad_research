VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Load Library Injection

EXPLANATION: 

The code uses `System.loadLibrary("echo");` to load a native library at runtime.  This presents a vulnerability because the library name ("echo") is hardcoded. An attacker could potentially manipulate the environment to load a malicious library with a similar name, leading to code execution or other harmful actions. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   **Use a more secure mechanism for loading libraries:**  Consider using a whitelist of trusted libraries or a more controlled library loading mechanism.  
*   **Validate library names:**  Sanitize and validate the name of the library being loaded to ensure it matches expected values.  

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  class Echo {
                        
                           public native void runEcho();static {
                              
                                 System.loadLibrary("echo");
                           }public static void main(String[] args) {
                              
                                 new Echo().runEcho();
                           }
                     }
               
               
```
