VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Password Storage
EXPLANATION:  The code stores passwords as plaintext in a `char*` variable. This is a severe vulnerability because it leaves passwords directly accessible in memory and potentially in logs or other files. An attacker who can access this memory could easily read the passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  Password should never be stored in plain text.  

* **Hashing:** Use a strong, cryptographically secure hashing function like Argon2 or bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them. This transforms the password into an irreversible string, rendering it useless to attackers even if they breach the system. 
* **Salting:**  Combine a unique, random salt with each password before hashing. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use precomputed rainbow tables to crack passwords. 
* **Secure Storage:** Store hashed passwords in a secure and isolated location, ideally using an encrypted database.



ORIGINAL CODE:
 
                  private: char* password;
