VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for insecure storage of passwords in plain text
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet declares a public member variable `password` of type `char*`.  Storing passwords directly as plain text is a serious vulnerability because it allows attackers to easily access and compromise user credentials if they gain access to the program's memory or storage.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Hash Passwords:**  Never store passwords in plain text.  Use a strong cryptographic hash function (like bcrypt or Argon2) to generate a unique hash for each password.
2. **Salt Passwords:**  Combine each password hash with a unique, random salt. This makes it much harder for attackers to use precomputed tables ("rainbow tables") to crack passwords.
3. **Secure Storage:**  If you must store password hashes, do so securely in an encrypted database or file system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
                  public: char* password;
               
```
