VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code takes untrusted input (from `GetUntrustedInput()`) and directly uses it to construct a file path. The sanitization performed using `$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;` only removes consecutive dots, which might be insufficient to prevent directory traversal attacks.  An attacker could manipulate the input to access files or directories outside the intended path.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Escape User Input:** Instead of relying on simple string replacement, properly escape the `$Username` variable before constructing the file path. This ensures that characters like `.` and `..` cannot be used for directory traversal. 
2. **Validate File Paths:**  Implement stricter validation to ensure that the constructed file path falls within the allowed directory structure. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
