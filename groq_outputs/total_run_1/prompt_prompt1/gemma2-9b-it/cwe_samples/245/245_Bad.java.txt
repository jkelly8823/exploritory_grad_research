VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Database Credentials
EXPLANATION: 
The database connection string `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysqldb` contains hardcoded credentials, specifically the database name "mysqldb". While it doesn't explicitly expose the username and password in this snippet, storing them directly in the code is highly insecure. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables and read them at runtime using `System.getenv()`. 
* **Configuration File:** Use a dedicated configuration file (e.g., properties file, YAML) to store sensitive data. Load the configuration file when the application starts.
* **Database Secrets Management:**  Implement a dedicated secrets management system if you're dealing with a production environment. This allows for secure storage and rotation of credentials. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  public class DatabaseConnection {
                        private static final String CONNECT_STRING = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysqldb";private Connection conn = null;
                           public DatabaseConnection() {}
                           public void openDatabaseConnection() {try {conn = DriverManager.getConnection(CONNECT_STRING);} catch (SQLException ex) {...}}
                           // Member functions for retrieving database connection and accessing database...
                     }

```
