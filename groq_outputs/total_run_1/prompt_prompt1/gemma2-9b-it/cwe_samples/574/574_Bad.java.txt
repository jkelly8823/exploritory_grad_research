VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Excessive use of synchronized blocks

EXPLANATION: The code excessively uses synchronized blocks on every setter method for the `Customer` object. This can lead to performance issues as it introduces excessive locking, potentially creating contention and slowing down concurrent access to the object's data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Review the Necessity of Locking:**  Assess if every setter method truly requires synchronization. For example, if a setter method only modifies a field that doesn't affect other fields within the object, then synchronization is likely unnecessary. 2. **Use Fine-Grained Locking:** If synchronization is required, consider using more fine-grained locking mechanisms. For instance, instead of synchronizing an entire method, synchronize on a specific field or a smaller group of fields. 3. **Explore Alternatives:**  Depending on the specific context, consider using concurrency strategies like atomic variables, immutable objects, or concurrent data structures to achieve desired data consistency without relying on excessive synchronization.

ORIGINAL CODE: 

```java
@Entity
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    
    private String id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Address address;
    public Customer() {...}
    public Customer(String id, String firstName, String lastName) {...}
    @Id
    public String getCustomerId() {...}
    public synchronized void setCustomerId(String id) {...}
    public String getFirstName() {...}
    public synchronized void setFirstName(String firstName) {...}
    public String getLastName() {...}
    public synchronized void setLastName(String lastName) {...}
    @OneToOne()
    public Address getAddress() {...}
    public synchronized void setAddress(Address address) {...}
}  
```
