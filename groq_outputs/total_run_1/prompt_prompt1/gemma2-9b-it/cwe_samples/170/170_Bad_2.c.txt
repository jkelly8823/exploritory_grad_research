VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION:
The `strncpy` function, used to copy the contents of `longString` into `shortString`, doesn't automatically add a null terminator if the length of `longString` exceeds the provided destination size (16 in this case). If `longString` were longer than 15 characters, the copying would continue beyond the allocated space for `shortString`, resulting in a buffer overflow. This could lead to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even malicious code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use `snprintf`:** Replace `strncpy` with `snprintf`, which allows you to specify both the source and destination sizes, ensuring safe string copying.

2. **Validate Input:**  Always validate the length of input strings before copying them into buffers to prevent buffer overflows. Check if the length of `longString` is less than or equal to 15 before calling `strncpy`.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char longString[] = "String signifying nothing";
  char shortString[16];
  strncpy(shortString, longString, 16);
  printf("The last character in shortString is: %c (%1$x)\n", shortString[15]);
  return (0);
}
```
