VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for timing attacks due to reliance on `equals()` for comparison in method checks.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code defines a `Truck` class with an `equals()` method that compares the `make` and `model` fields of two `Truck` objects. However, an attacker could potentially exploit timing differences in the `equals()` method execution to infer information about the compared objects.

Specifically, if the implementation of `make.equals()` and `model.equals()` involves operations with varying execution times depending on the input values, an attacker could use timing attacks to gain information about the contents of the `make` and `model` fields.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Implement a constant-time comparison:** Modify the `equals()` method to ensure that all comparisons within the method execute in a consistent amount of time, regardless of the input values. This can be achieved using techniques like constant-time string comparison libraries or implementing the comparison logic manually with constant-time operations.

- **Utilize a secure library:** Consider using a secure hashing library to generate a unique hash for each `Truck` object based on its `make`, `model`, and `year` fields. This would eliminate the need for direct string comparisons and mitigate the risk of timing attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class Truck {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == null) return false;
        if (o == this) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Truck)) return false;
         Truck t = (Truck) o;
         return (this.make.equals(t.getMake()) && this.model.equals(t.getModel()));
    }
}
```
