VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `recvfrom` to receive data from a client.  The `recvfrom` function can lead to a buffer overflow if the received data exceeds the size of the buffer (`msg`) allocated. Without proper bounds checking, this could allow an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute malicious code.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Check:** Before using `recvfrom`, implement robust bounds checking to ensure the received data size does not exceed `MAX_MSG`.
2. **Safe Buffer Handling:** Consider using safer alternatives to `memset` for initializing buffers, such as `bzero` or `std::fill`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  sd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0); serv.sin_family = AF_INET;serv.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);servr.sin_port = htons(1008);bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *) & serv, sizeof(serv));while (1) {
                        
                           memset(msg, 0x0, MAX_MSG);clilen = sizeof(cli);if (inet_ntoa(cli.sin_addr)==...) n = recvfrom(sd, msg, MAX_MSG, 0, (struct sockaddr *) & cli, &clilen);
                     }              
               
```
