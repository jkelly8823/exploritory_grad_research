VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Multiple potential race conditions exist within the provided code snippet. Specifically, between the deposit and withdraw methods, there is a lack of proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to potential data inconsistencies.
EXPLANATION: 
The code utilizes a `ReentrantLock` and a `Condition` to manage concurrent access to the `balance` variable. However, the placement and usage of the `sufficientFundsCondition.signalAll()` and `sufficientFundsCondition.await()` calls can lead to race conditions.

1. **Lack of atomic balance update:**  While the `balanceChangeLock` protects the `balance` variable from simultaneous reads and writes, the update operation (`double newBalance = balance + amount; balance = newBalance;`) is not atomic. If multiple threads attempt to deposit or withdraw concurrently, they could read the same outdated `balance` value, leading to incorrect updates.

2. **Conditional signal misuse:** The `sufficientFundsCondition.signalAll()` call in the `deposit` method signals **all** waiting threads. This might signal threads that are not intending to withdraw, causing unnecessary context switching and performance overhead. 

3. **Potential deadlock in withdraw:** The `withdraw` method uses `sufficientFundsCondition.await()` to wait for funds to become available. If a `deposit` thread acquires the lock and signals, but the `withdraw` thread doesn't immediately wake up due to other thread scheduling, it could lead to a deadlock where neither thread can proceed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Atomic update:** Replace the non-atomic `balance` update with a single atomic operation, ensuring the entire update process is indivisible. This could be achieved using:
   - AtomicDouble: `AtomicDouble balance = new AtomicDouble(0);`
   - `balance.addAndGet(amount);`
2. **Targeted signal:** Signal only the specific threads that are relevant to the current deposit. This could be achieved by keeping track of waiters and signaling them directly.


3. **Deadlock prevention:** In complex scenarios, consider additional synchronization mechanisms like separate locks for `deposit` and `withdraw` operations to minimize the risk of deadlock.
