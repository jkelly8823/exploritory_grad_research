VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for JavaScript Injection 
EXPLANATION: 
The `@JavascriptInterface` annotation indicates that the `getUserInfo` method can be called from JavaScript code.  The method directly calls `currentUser.Info()`, which appears to directly use the result from `currentUser.Info()` without any sanitization. This opens the possibility of a JavaScript Injection vulnerability where malicious JavaScript code could potentially manipulate the value of `currentUser.Info()` or the method used to retrieve it, leading to unexpected behavior or potentially harmful actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:** Carefully sanitize any data retrieved from `currentUser.Info()` before returning it. This may involve escaping special characters or filtering out potentially harmful code. 
2. **Use Prepared Statements (If Applicable):** If the data is stored in a database, use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. **Validate Data:** Implement robust validation logic to ensure that the `currentUser.Info()` data conforms to expected formats and does not contain unexpected or malicious content.
4. **Limit Scope:** Consider limiting the permissions or functionality available to JavaScript code through the `@JavascriptInterface` annotation to minimize potential damage. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                    final class JavaScriptInterface {
                        JavaScriptInterface () { }
                           @JavascriptInterfacepublic String getUserInfo() {return currentUser.getInfo();}
                     }
               
}
               
               
```
