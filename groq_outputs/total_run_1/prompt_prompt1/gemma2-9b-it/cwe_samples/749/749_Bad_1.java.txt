VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Url Redirecting Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if the provided URL starts with "examplescheme:" and then extracts a substring "getUserInfo". If this substring is present, it calls a function `writeDataToView`  passing the UserData object. This structure is susceptible to an attack where an attacker could craft a malicious URL that appears benign.

**Potential Attack:**  An attacker could create a URL resembling a legitimate "examplescheme" URL, potentially using a technique like URL encoding to bypass initial whitelisting checks. If the attacker crafts a URL that looks valid but contains malicious parameters after "getUserInfo", the `writeDataToView` function could be tricked into executing unintended actions. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Inputs:**  Never directly trust user-supplied URLs. Sanitize and validate the entire URL before processing it. 
2. **Whitelisting with Regular Expressions:** Instead of hardcoding the expected substring "getUserInfo", use a more robust whitelisting mechanism. Define regular expressions that precisely specify the acceptable patterns for the URL. 
3. **Limit Sensitive Data Exposure:**  Avoid directly exposing sensitive data like "UserData" in the response to URL redirects. Consider implementing appropriate authorization and authentication mechanisms to control access to sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
      // Android
      @Overridepublic boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
         if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){
            if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){
               writeDataToView(view, UserData);
               return false;
            }else{
               return true;
            }
         }
      }
```
