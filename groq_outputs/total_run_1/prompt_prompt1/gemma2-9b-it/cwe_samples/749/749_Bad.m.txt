VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for URL Manipulation and Code Injection

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet checks if a URL's scheme is "exampleScheme" and if its resourceSpecifier starts with "specialFunction".  The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `functionString` variable, derived from the `URL` resourceSpecifier, is directly used in a further conditional statement `if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){`.  An attacker could potentially manipulate the URL's resourceSpecifier to include malicious code or commands that, if executed, could lead to a code injection vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the `functionString` before using it in any conditional statements or function calls. This could involve:
    * Limiting the allowed characters in the resourceSpecifier.
    * Whitelisting acceptable function names.
    * Escaping special characters within the resourceSpecifier.
2. **Parameter Validation:** Validate the input parameters, especially those extracted from the URL. Ensure that they conform to expected formats and lengths.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```
                     // iOS
                     -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
                        NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
                              NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                                    
                                       
                                       // Make data available back in webview.
                                       UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
                                 }return NO;
                           }return YES;
                     }
               
               ```


It is crucial to carefully review and sanitize any user-supplied input in web applications to prevent potential code injection vulnerabilities.
