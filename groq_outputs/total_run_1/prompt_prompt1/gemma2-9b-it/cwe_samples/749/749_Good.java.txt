VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly concatenates the user-provided `databaseName` into the SQL query string.  This opens the door to SQL injection attacks where a malicious user could provide a database name that includes harmful SQL code.  An attacker could potentially:

* Drop other databases
* Access sensitive data
* Modify existing data
* Take control of the entire database server

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterize the query:** Use prepared statements to separate SQL structure from user-provided data. This prevents the user input from being interpreted as code.
   ```java
   private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
       try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("DROP DATABASE ?");) {
           stmt.setString(1, databaseName); 
           stmt.executeUpdate();
       } catch (SQLException ex) { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **Input Validation:**  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in queries. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
                        try {
                              Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
                              
                           } catch (SQLException ex) {...}}
                     
                  
               
                              
               
            
               
            ```
