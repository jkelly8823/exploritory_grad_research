VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 

The provided code snippet demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability.  The `databaseName` string is directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization or validation.  An attacker could provide a malicious `databaseName` value that contains SQL code, potentially allowing them to:

* Drop unintended databases.
* Access or modify sensitive data.
* Take control of the database server.

For example, an attacker could pass `' OR '1'='1` as the `databaseName`, effectively bypassing any intended checks and successfully dropping the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Parameterize Query:** The most secure approach is to use parameterized queries (prepared statements). This separates the SQL code from user-provided data, preventing malicious injection.


   ```java
   public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
       try {
           PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("DROP DATABASE ?");
           stmt.setString(1, databaseName); 
           stmt.execute(); 
       } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
   }
   ```

2. **Input Validation:**  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Check for:

*  Unexpected characters (like single quotes, semicolons, etc.)
*  Data type correctness 
*  Length restrictions



ORIGINAL CODE:


```java
                  public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
                        try {
                              Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
                              
                           } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
                     }
               
               ```
