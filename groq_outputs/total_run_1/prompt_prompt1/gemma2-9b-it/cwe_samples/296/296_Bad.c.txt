VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for insecure certificate verification

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet checks the SSL certificate verification result. However, the comparison using  `((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))` is problematic. 

Here's why:
* **Missing comprehensive checks:** It only considers two specific verification results (`X509_V_OK` and `X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`). There are numerous other potential SSL verification errors that are not handled.
* **Trusting self-signed certificates:** While self-signed certificates might be acceptable in certain specific scenarios, blindly trusting them without further validation can be a security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Thorough error handling:**  Instead of relying on a limited set of conditions, implement comprehensive error handling to account for all possible SSL verification failures. Refer to the OpenSSL documentation for a complete list of possible verification results.
* **Principle of least privilege:**  Reassess the need to trust self-signed certificates. If possible, use trusted certificate authorities for issuance. In scenarios where self-signed certificates are unavoidable, implement stricter validation logic beyond simply checking for self-signed status.
* **Log and alert:** Log any SSL verification errors and consider implementing alerts or escalation procedures for security incidents.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host)foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))


// certificate looks good, host can be trusted


```
