VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype pollution vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code utilizes a function `setValueByPath` which allows setting values on an object by a given path. However, the paths passed  (`"__proto__.isAdmin"` and `"constructor.prototype.isAdmin"`)  target the prototype chain of the object. This can lead to prototype pollution, where attackers can inject malicious properties into the prototype of built-in objects or libraries, potentially compromising the entire application. 

When `setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)` is executed, it sets the `isAdmin` property on the `__proto__` of the empty object. Since `__proto__` can be inherited by other objects, this could affect the behavior of objects that inherit from the target object, even if they weren't explicitly modified.

Similarly, `"constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)` modifies the `isAdmin` property on the prototype of the constructor function itself. This can have widespread consequences as all instances created from that constructor will inherit the modified prototype and the injected property.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize Input Paths:**

   - Carefully validate and sanitize all paths passed to `setValueByPath` to prevent attackers from injecting malicious prototype-related properties.  

2. **Restrict Prototype Access:**

   - Consider restricting or eliminating direct access to the `__proto__` property.
   - You can use object.freeze() to prevent modifications to the prototype chain of an object.

3. **Minimize Prototype Manipulation:**

   -  Avoid directly modifying the prototype chain unless absolutely necessary. 
   -  Explore alternative approaches to achieve the desired functionality without relying on prototype pollution.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
