VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to buffer overflows. Here's why:

1. **Uninitialized Pointer:** The `char* test_string;` declaration creates a pointer to a character, but it's not initialized. This means its value is unpredictable and could point to a random memory location.

2. **Dynamic String Allocation:** Inside the `if` statement, `test_string = "Hello World!";` attempts to assign a fixed-size string literal to the `test_string` pointer.  

3. **Write Without Size Check:**  The code doesn't allocate enough memory to hold the "Hello World!" string. If the pointer `test_string` is pointing to a buffer that's too small, writing the string to it can lead to a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space for a buffer.

	This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting data, crashing the program, or even allowing an attacker to execute malicious code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, follow these recommendations:

1. **Allocate Memory Properly:** Before assigning the string, dynamically allocate enough memory to hold the string "Hello World!" and its null terminator. For example:
   ```c
   char *test_string = malloc(13);  // Allocate 13 bytes (for "Hello World!\0")
   if (i != err_val)
   {
       strcpy(test_string, "Hello World!");
   }
   ```
2. **Use Safer String Functions:**  Instead of using `=`, which could lead to buffer overflows, prefer safer string functions like `strcpy` and `strncpy` when copying strings. The `strncpy` function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing overflows.

3. **Input Validation:**  If the string is coming from user input, validate its length to prevent overflows.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                char *test_string;                if (i != err_val)
                {                    test_string = "Hello World!";                }
                printf("%s", test_string);
