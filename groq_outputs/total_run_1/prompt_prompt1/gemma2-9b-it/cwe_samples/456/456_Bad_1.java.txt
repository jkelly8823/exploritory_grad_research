VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct Password Comparison

EXPLANATION:  The `authenticateUser` method compares the provided password directly with the stored password in the `user` object. This is a highly insecure practice because it allows attackers to see the password in plain text if they can gain access to the code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Use a Password Hashing Algorithm:**  Instead of storing passwords directly, hash them using a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or Argon2.  When a user logs in, hash the entered password and compare it to the stored hash.  

2. **Salt Passwords:**  Add a unique random salt to each password before hashing. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use pre-computed rainbow tables to crack passwords.

3. **Consider Password-Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDFs):** PBKDFs are designed to make password cracking computationally expensive. They apply a hash function iteratively to the password and salt, making it harder for attackers to brute-force the password.
