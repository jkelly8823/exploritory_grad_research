VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because the user-provided input `invoiceID.Text` is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious invoiceID value that modifies the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to retrieve sensitive data, modify existing records, or even execute arbitrary code on the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use parameterized queries:** Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL query, use parameterized queries. This involves defining placeholders in the query and providing the values separately to the database. For example, instead of:

   ```csharp
   SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
   query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);
   ```

   Use:

   ```csharp
   string query = "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id";
   SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn);
   cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", invoiceID);  // Assuming invoiceID is a SqlParameter or similar
   ```

2. **Validate user input:** Before using the `invoiceID.Text` value in the query, validate it to ensure it meets the expected format and data type. This can help prevent unexpected values from being used in the query.
3. **Escape special characters:** If parameterized queries are not an option, you can try escaping special characters in the user input to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL commands. However, this is not as secure as using parameterized queries.




ORIGINAL CODE: 
```csharp
                  ...
		  conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);
		  conn.Open();
		  int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text); 
		  SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
		  query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id); 
		  SqlDataReader objReader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();
		  ...		  
  
               
               
  ```
