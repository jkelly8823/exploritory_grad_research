VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION: 
The code calls `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` to determine the size of a buffer. However, it then uses this value in a `memcpy` call with `(returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1)` as the size limit. This creates a risk of a buffer overflow. 

Here's why:

* **Unknown `returnChunkSize` Behavior:** We don't know what `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` will return. If it returns a value smaller than the actual size of `destBuf`, subtracting 1 can lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer boundaries.

* **Buffer Overflows:**  `memcpy` blindly copies data without checking sizes. If `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns a value too small, writing `srcBuf` into `destBuf` could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate `returnChunkSize`:**  Double-check the value returned by `returnChunkSize(destBuf)`. Ensure it's a valid size limit for `destBuf`. Don't blindly subtract 1 without knowing the context.
2. **Use Bounds-Safe Functions:**  Consider using safer functions that handle boundary checks for you. For example:
   - `strncpy` (copies up to a specific number of characters, including the null terminator)
   - `snprintf` (formats and writes a string to a buffer, safely handling buffer overflows)



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  int returnChunkSize(void *) {
                        
                           
                           /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
                           
                           
                           * else, return -1 to indicate an error
                           
                           
                           */
                           ...
                     }int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
               
               ...}
               
               
               
   ```
