VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader));` allocates memory for `headers` based on the value of `numHeaders`. If `numHeaders` is larger than expected, this could lead to a buffer overflow when `ParsePacketHeaders` attempts to store data into the allocated memory. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Validate `numHeaders`:**  Check if `numHeaders` is within a reasonable range before allocating memory. 
* **Use Safe Memory Allocation:** Consider using a safer memory allocation function that performs input validation and bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  DataPacket *packet;int numHeaders;PacketHeader *headers;
                     sock=AcceptSocketConnection();ReadPacket(packet, sock);numHeaders =packet->headers;
                     if (numHeaders > 100) {ExitError("too many headers!");}headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader);ParsePacketHeaders(packet, headers);
               
               
               ```
