VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader));`  allocates memory based on the value of `numHeaders`. If an attacker can manipulate `numHeaders` to be a very large value, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This happens because the allocated memory might be insufficient to hold all the headers, causing data to be written beyond the intended bounds of the `headers` array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Checking:** Implement stricter bounds checking before calling `malloc`.  Ensure that `numHeaders` is within a reasonable range and doesn't exceed a predefined maximum.
2. **Input Validation:** Validate the `numHeaders` value received from the input (`ReadPacket`).  Sanitize the input to prevent attackers from sending malicious values.
3. **Safe Memory Allocation:** Consider using safer memory allocation functions that provide bounds checking, such as `calloc`, or libraries that mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  DataPacket *packet;int numHeaders;PacketHeader *headers;
                     sock=AcceptSocketConnection();ReadPacket(packet, sock);numHeaders =packet->headers;
                     if (numHeaders > 100) {ExitError("too many headers!");}headers = malloc(numHeaders * sizeof(PacketHeader);ParsePacketHeaders(packet, headers);
