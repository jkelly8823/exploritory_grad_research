VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Blob Public Access 

EXPLANATION:

The provided code snippet uses the Azure CLI to update an Azure Storage account. The `--allow-blob-public-access true` flag enables public read access to blobs in the storage account. This poses a significant security risk as it allows anyone on the internet to access and potentially download sensitive data stored within the blobs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Remove the `--allow-blob-public-access true` flag:**  This is the most crucial step to mitigate the vulnerability.  Do not expose blobs publicly unless absolutely necessary.  

* **Implement Access Control Policies:** Utilize Azure's robust access control policies to define precise permissions for blob access.  This includes using shared access signatures (SAS) for limited-time or specific operations, and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions at the account, container, and blob levels.
* **Secure your Deployment and Secrets:**  Ensure that your Azure CLI credentials and any other sensitive information used to interact with your Azure environment are stored securely and are not exposed in plain text.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
		az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access true
	      
	      
	      
	      
```
