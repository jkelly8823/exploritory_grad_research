VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure storage account configuration - allows public access to blobs by default

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the Az CLI to update a storage account. The `--allow-blob-public-access false` flag is used to disable public blob access. However, the lack of consistent default configuration practices and the use of placeholders (denoted by `<storage-account>` and `<resource-group>`)  increases the risk of accidental re-enabling of public access if these values are not carefully managed.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Best Practice:** By default, public blob access should be disabled. 
* **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation to ensure that the  `<storage-account>`  and `<resource-group>` values are valid and correctly configured.
* **Version Control:**  Store and manage these configuration parameters in a version control system (like Git) with clear access controls to prevent accidental changes.
* **Automation Best Practices:** Follow best practices for automation, including using environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information. Avoid hardcoding credentials and other sensitive data directly into scripts. 
* **Regular Auditing:** Periodically audit your storage accounts and their configurations to ensure that security settings remain consistent and secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
		az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false
