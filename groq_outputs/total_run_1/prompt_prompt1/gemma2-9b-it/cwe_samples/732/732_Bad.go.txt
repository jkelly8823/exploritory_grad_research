VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3, 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper File Permissions
EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to create a file called "/etc/admin-users" and then sets its permissions to 0440 (read/write for owner, read for group, read for others). This is a security vulnerability because:

* **World Readable:** Setting the permissions to allow read access for others (world-readable) means that anyone on the system can read the contents of the file, which could contain sensitive information about administrative users.

* **Potential for Abuse:** An attacker with access to the system could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to administrative accounts or perform other malicious actions.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Restrict File Permissions:**  Change the permissions of the `/etc/admin-users` file to be more restrictive. A safer option would be to set permissions like `0600` (read/write for owner only), which would prevent any other user from accessing the file.
2. **Consider Alternative Storage:** Evaluate if storing sensitive user information in a file is the most secure approach.  Alternatives like a database with access controls or encrypted storage may be more appropriate.
3. **Least Privilege:** Ensure the processes that create and modify this file operate with the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```Go
                  
                  const adminFile = "/etc/admin-users"
                  func createAdminFileIfNotExists() error {
                     
                        file, err := os.Create(adminFile)
                        if err != nil {
                        
                           return err
                        
                        }
                        return nil
                  }
                  
                  
                  func changeModeOfAdminFile() error {
                     
                        fileMode := os.FileMode(0440)
                        if err := os.Chmod(adminFile, fileMode); err != nil {
                        
                           return err
                        
                        }
                        return nil
                  }
```
