VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Overly permissive IAM policy settings

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet uses the `gsutil` command to modify the IAM policy of a Google Cloud Storage bucket (`gs://BUCKET_NAME`). 

Specifically:

*  `gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME`: Removes the `allUsers` group from the bucket's IAM policy.
*  `gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME`: Removes the `allAuthenticatedUsers` group from the bucket's IAM policy.

While removing these groups seems like a security best practice, this could be overly restrictive depending on the intended access control. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Review Required Access:** Carefully evaluate which groups and/or individual users actually need access to the bucket.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum necessary permissions to users or groups. Instead of broadly removing groups,  consider granting specific roles with granular permissions (e.g., `Storage Object Viewer`, `Storage Object Creator`).
3. **Use Bucket-Level Policies:**  For more complex access control, create and utilize bucket-level IAM policies to define specific permissions for different users or groups.
4. **Regularly Audit Permissions:**  Periodically review and audit IAM permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and that unnecessary access has not been granted.

```
		gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
		gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
