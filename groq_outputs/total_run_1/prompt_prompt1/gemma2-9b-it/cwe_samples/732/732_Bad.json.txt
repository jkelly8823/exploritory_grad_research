VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Overly permissive access control.
EXPLANATION: The code grants the "roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner" role to "allUsers". This allows any user on the internet to perform all operations on the bucket, including deleting it. Similarly, the "roles/storage.legacyBucketReader" role grants read access to all users, which may not be necessary or desirable depending on the sensitivity of the data. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Restrict `allUsers` access:** Instead of granting the "roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner" role to "allUsers", limit access to specific users or groups that require full control. You can achieve this by replacing "allUsers" with individual user email addresses or service account IDs.
2.  **Limit read access:** Reassess the need for granting read access to all users ("allUsers" and "projectViewer: PROJECT-ID"). Consider using more granular access control mechanisms to restrict read access to only the users or groups that require it. 
3. **Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strive to use pre-defined roles with specific permissions whenever possible. Avoid creating overly broad custom roles that grant excessive privileges.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 
```json
		{
		
		  "bindings":[{
		  
		    "members":[
		    
		      "projectEditor: PROJECT-ID",
		      "projectOwner: PROJECT-ID"
		    
		    ],
		    "role":"roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner"
		  
		  },
		  {
		  
		    "members":[
		    
		      "allUsers",
		      "projectViewer: PROJECT-ID"
		      ],
		      "role":"roles/storage.legacyBucketReader"
		    
		    }
		  
		  ]
		
		}
