VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information - Bucket Name


EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet `gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME` directly exposes the bucket name `BUCKET_NAME` in plain text. This can be a security risk as it could allow unauthorized individuals to access sensitive data stored within that bucket.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use Environment Variables:** Store the bucket name in an environment variable and access it within the code. This will prevent the bucket name from being hardcoded and directly visible in the code.

2. **Parameterize Input**: If possible, accept the bucket name as a parameter to the script instead of hardcoding it. This allows for more flexible and secure handling of bucket names.

3. **Secure Logging:**  Avoid logging sensitive information like bucket names in plain text. Use masking or encryption techniques to protect such data in logs.
