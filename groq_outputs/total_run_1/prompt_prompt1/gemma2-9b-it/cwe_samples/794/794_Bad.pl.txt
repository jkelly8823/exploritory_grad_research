VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a path traversal vulnerability. 

The line `$filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;` directly concatenates user input obtained from `GetUntrustedInput()` with a file path. The user-supplied `$Username` could potentially contain malicious characters like ".." (or "../"), which, when concatenated, could lead an attacker to access files outside the intended "/home/user/" directory.

For example, if an attacker submits a username like "user../../etc/passwd," it could result in the code attempting to read the sensitive "/etc/passwd" file instead of a file under the user's home directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation to prevent malicious characters like "..", "/", "\", and other directory traversal sequences from being entered. You can use regular expressions or whitelist-based approaches to achieve this.
* **Use Safe File Path Construction:** Avoid directly concatenating user input with file paths. Instead, consider using parameterized queries or libraries designed for secure file path construction that escape potentially dangerous characters. 

ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
