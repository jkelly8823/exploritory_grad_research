VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Password
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a hardcoded password "Mew!" for administrative access. This is a severe vulnerability as any attacker knowing this password can gain unauthorized access.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Store passwords securely:**  Never hardcode passwords directly into the code. Use a secure storage mechanism like a configuration file or a database, and store passwords using hashing algorithms to protect them.
* **Use proper input validation:** Validate and sanitize user-provided passwords to prevent injection attacks.
* **Implement multi-factor authentication:**  Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication, such as a password and a one-time code.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
                        if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
                              
                printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
                           }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
                     }
               
               ```
