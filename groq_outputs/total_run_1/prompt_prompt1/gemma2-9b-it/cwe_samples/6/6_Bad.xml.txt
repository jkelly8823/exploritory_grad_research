VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Session ID Weakness
EXPLANATION: 
The code sets the session ID length to 8 bytes (`idLengthBytes="8"`). While not inherently wrong, a fixed-length session ID can be vulnerable to attacks if the length is too short. 

Attackers might employ brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks to guess session IDs more efficiently.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Increase Session ID Length:**  Consider increasing the session ID length beyond 8 bytes to make brute-force attacks more difficult. A longer ID provides more entropy, making it harder to guess.
2. **Use Secure Random Number Generation:** Ensure that the session ID is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator to further enhance its randomness and unpredictability.
3. **Consider Using UUIDs:**  Consider using universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for session IDs. They are designed to be cryptographically secure and have a much larger possible ID space.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```xml
<sun-web-app>
  ...<session-config>
    <session-properties>
      <property name="idLengthBytes" value="8">
        <description>The number of bytes in this web module's session ID.</description>
      </property>
    </session-properties>
  </session-config>...
</sun-web-app>
