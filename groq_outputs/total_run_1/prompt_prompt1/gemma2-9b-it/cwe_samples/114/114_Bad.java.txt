VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumber where System.loadLibrary("library.dll"); is located 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Code Injection
EXPLANATION:  The use of `System.loadLibrary("library.dll");`  without proper validation of the library path or name can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially manipulate the library name to load a malicious DLL, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize Inputs:** Never directly use user-supplied data in the library path or name. 
* **Whitelisting:** Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed library names and paths. 
* **Code Signing:**  Verify the digital signature of any loaded libraries to ensure their authenticity.
* **Restricted Permissions:**  Run your application with the minimum required permissions. 
* **Avoid Dynamic Loading If Possible:**  Consider static linking libraries whenever feasible to reduce the attack surface.




ORIGINAL CODE: 
...System.loadLibrary("library.dll");...
