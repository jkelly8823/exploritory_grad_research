VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential DLL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The use of `LoadLibrary("liberty.dll");` without proper validation of the DLL path can lead to DLL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially modify the `liberty.dll` file on the system to execute malicious code. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user-supplied input before using it as a DLL path.
- Use a trusted and verified source for DLLs.
- Consider using alternative loading mechanisms that provide better security controls.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
LoadLibrary("liberty.dll");
```
