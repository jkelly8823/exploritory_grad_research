VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Variable shadowing 
EXPLANATION:
On line 4, a new String variable `productSummary` is declared within the `try` block, shadowing the variable declared outside the block. This means the `productSummary` declared outside the `try` block becomes inaccessible within the `try` block.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Rename the variable within the `try` block to avoid variable shadowing. 

 For example:
```java
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
 String productSummary = new String("");
 try {
  String innerProductSummary = getProductSummary(index); 
  productSummary = innerProductSummary; 
 } catch (Exception ex) {
  // Handle the exception
 }
 return productSummary;
}
```

 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java 
                     
                     // Method called from servlet to obtain product information
                     public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
                     
                        String productSummary = new String("");
                           try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
                           
                           } catch (Exception ex) {...}
                           return productSummary;
                     }
                     public String getProductSummary(int index) {return products[index];}
               
               ```
