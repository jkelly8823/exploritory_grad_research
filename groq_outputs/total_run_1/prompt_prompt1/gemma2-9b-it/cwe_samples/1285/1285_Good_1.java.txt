VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-Bounds Array Index Access
EXPLANATION:
 The code attempts to retrieve an element from the `productArray` using the `get(index)` method. If the `index` is out of range (greater than or equal to the size of the arraylist), it will result in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. While the code includes a `try-catch` block to handle this exception, it doesn't prevent the potential vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate the index before access:**  Check if `index` is within the valid range of the `productArray` (0 to `productArray.size() - 1`) before attempting to access it.
2. **Use bounds-checking libraries:** Consider using libraries or frameworks that provide built-in bounds checking for array-like structures, reducing the risk of Out-of-Bounds errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 ```java
 ArrayList productArray = new ArrayList(MAX_PRODUCTS);...try {productSummary = (String) productArray.get(index);} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {...}
               
            
 ```
