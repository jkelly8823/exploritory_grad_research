VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Variable Shadowing
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability called variable shadowing.  On line 6, within the `displayProductSummary` method, a new variable named `productSummary` is declared and initialized to an empty string. This declaration shadows the `productSummary` variable declared outside the `try` block on the same line. 

This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior because the variable used within the `try` block is not the one intended to be used for storing the product summary.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Rename the variable within the try block:**  Change the name of the `productSummary` variable inside the `try` block to something distinct, such as `tempProductSummary` or `summaryInsideTry`.

2. **Use a different naming convention:** Consider using a prefix like `_` or `temp` to indicate temporary variables to avoid accidental shadowing.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = "";
    if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {productSummary = products[index];}else {System.err.println("index is out of bounds");throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();}
    return productSummary;
}
```
