VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An XSS vulnerability occurs when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into a web page's HTML. In this case, an `<input type="hidden">` tag is present without any validation. If a malicious user could manipulate the value of this hidden input field, they could inject scripts into the page that could steal user data, hijack sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Always sanitize any user-supplied data before displaying it on a webpage. This involves encoding special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML code.

2. **Use Prepared Statements (For Database Interactions):** If the hidden input is used to construct database queries, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These techniques separate data from code, mitigating the risk of SQL injection. 

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```html
                  <input type="hidden" 
               
               ```
