VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Catches only IOException
EXPLANATION:
While the code does catch an `IOException`, it doesn't catch other potential exceptions that could be thrown within the `try` block. This leaves the application vulnerable to unexpected crashes or improper handling of errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Catch a broader exception type:** Consider catching `Exception` instead of `IOException` to cover a wider range of potential errors. This allows for more robust error handling.
2. **Be specific:** If you know the kind of exception you expect besides `IOException`, catch them specifically. This enables targeted error handling and prevents unnecessary broad catching.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  try {
       // something that might throw IOException
       ...
  } catch (IOException ioe) {response.sendError(SC_NOT_FOUND);}
