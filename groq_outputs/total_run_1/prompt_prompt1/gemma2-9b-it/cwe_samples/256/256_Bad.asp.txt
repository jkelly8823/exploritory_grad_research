VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet reveals hardcoded database credentials ("uid", "pwd") within the connection string.  This is a severe security vulnerability.  Storing sensitive information directly in code exposes it to potential compromise if the code is accessed or viewed by unauthorized individuals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Environment Variables:**  Store database credentials in environment variables and reference them within the connection string. This isolates the credentials from the codebase.

2. **Configuration Files:**  Utilize a separate configuration file (e.g., .ini, .config, JSON) to manage database settings.  Keep this file outside the main code repository and secure its permissions.
3. **Secure Credential Management Services:**  Employ a dedicated secrets management system, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to store and retrieve sensitive data securely.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
