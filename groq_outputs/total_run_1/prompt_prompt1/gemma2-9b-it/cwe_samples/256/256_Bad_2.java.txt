VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: 

The provided code snippet reveals the clear storage of sensitive information (LDAP username and password) directly within a resource bundle file (.properties). This practice is highly discouraged due to the vulnerability it presents.  Hardcoded credentials are readily viewable and accessible by anyone with permission to access the file system containing the resource bundle. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Environment Variables:**  Store sensitive information like usernames and passwords in environment variables.  Access these variables from within your application instead of reading from the resource file. 

2. **Configuration Management:** Utilize a secure configuration management system like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. These platforms offer robust access control, encryption, and rotation mechanisms for sensitive data.

3. **Database Storage:**  For more complex configurations and permissions, consider storing credentials in a secure database. Ensure the database itself is adequately protected and only authorized users have access to sensitive information.

                     # Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
                     ...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...
               ...
