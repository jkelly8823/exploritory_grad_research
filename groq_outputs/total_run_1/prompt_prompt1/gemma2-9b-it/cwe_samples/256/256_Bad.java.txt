VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct file reading for sensitive information

EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability where a sensitive value, the password, is read directly from a file named "config.properties" using `prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"))`.  This is highly insecure as:

* **Plaintext Storage:** The password is stored in plain text within the "config.properties" file, making it easily accessible to anyone with access to the file system.

* **Increased Attack Surface:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the password if they compromise the server or system where the "config.properties" file resides.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Encrypt Sensitive Data:**  Never store passwords or other sensitive information in plain text files. Use strong encryption techniques to protect the data while it's stored. Consider using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system for storing sensitive values.

2. **Secure File Permissions:**  Ensure that the "config.properties" file has restrictive permissions to prevent unauthorized read access.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only grant necessary access to the code that needs to read the configuration file. 



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = prop.getProperty("password");DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);...
