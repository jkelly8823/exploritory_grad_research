VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  
Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) 
EXPLANATION:
The code extracts the client's IP address using `req.getRemoteAddr()`.  However, it then uses `InetAddress.getByName(ip)` to resolve the IP address to a host name.  This operation executes a system call which is generally safe.  However, an attacker could provide a malicious hostname in the `req.getRemoteAddr()` field, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the `InetAddress.getByName()` implementation is vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Sanitize the input received from  `req.getRemoteAddr()`. 
* Do not rely solely on `InetAddress.getByName()` for hostname resolution. Use a whitelist of trusted domains or a more secure DNS resolution mechanism.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                  protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());}
               
               
               ```
