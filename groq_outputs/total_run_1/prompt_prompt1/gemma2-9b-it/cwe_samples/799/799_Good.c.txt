VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to unlimited login attempts.
EXPLANATION: 
The code lacks input validation and has a fixed number of allowed attempts (MAX_ATTEMPTS). An attacker could repeatedly send invalid credentials, exhausting `MAX_ATTEMPTS` and potentially crashing the server or preventing legitimate users from logging in.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that `username` and `password` are of valid formats and lengths.
2. **Rate limiting:** Introduce a rate limiting mechanism to restrict the number of login attempts from a single source within a specific timeframe.
3. **Account Locking:** Implement a temporary account lockout after a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  int count = 0;while ((isValidUser == 0) && (count < MAX_ATTEMPTS)) {
                        if (getNextMessage(socket, username, USERNAME_SIZE) > 0) {if (getNextMessage(socket, password, PASSWORD_SIZE) > 0) {isValidUser = AuthenticateUser(username, password);}}count++;
                     }if (isValidUser) {return(SUCCESS);}else {return(FAIL);}
               
            
```
