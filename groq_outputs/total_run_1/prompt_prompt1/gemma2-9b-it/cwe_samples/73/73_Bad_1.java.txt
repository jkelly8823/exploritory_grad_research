VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The line `amt = fis.read(arr);`  is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The code reads data from the file into the `arr` array without checking the length of the data being read. If the file content is larger than the size of the `arr` array, it will overwrite adjacent memory, potentially causing crashes or allowing attackers to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Check the size of the data being read:** Before reading data from the file, determine the maximum amount of data that can be safely stored in `arr`. Then, read the data in chunks, ensuring that each chunk does not exceed the available space in `arr`.

2. **Use a safer reading method:** Consider using `fis.read(arr, 0, bufferSize)` where `bufferSize` is the maximum amount of data to be read. This method allows you to specify the number of bytes to read, preventing accidental buffer overflows.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt");amt = fis.read(arr);out.println(arr);
