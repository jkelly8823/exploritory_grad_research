VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  
Unsafe use of user-supplied input in file deletion.

EXPLANATION:

The code directly uses the value of `request.getParameter("reportName")` to construct the file path without any sanitization or validation. This opens the door to a `Path Traversal` vulnerability. 

An attacker could manipulate the `reportName` parameter to include malicious directory components, potentially leading to:

* **Deletion of unintended files:**  The attacker could delete critical system files outside the intended "APFR reports" directory.
* **Execution of arbitrary commands:**  If the vulnerable file system allows it, attackers might be able to use path traversal to execute commands on the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize user input:**  Never directly trust user-supplied data. Before using `rName` in the file path, sanitize it using appropriate methods to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences. 

2. **Validate file paths:** Implement rigorous validation to ensure that the constructed file path remains within the intended "reports" directory. Use methods like `File.isAbsolute()` and `File.getCanonicalPath()`  to check for and prevent path traversal attempts.

3. **Use parameterized queries (if applicable):** If interacting with a database, utilize parameterized queries to prevent direct injection of user input into SQL statements. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);...rFile.delete();
