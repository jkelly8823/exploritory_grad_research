VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to directory traversal because it directly includes a file specified by user input (`$_GET['lang']`) without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft malicious input that points to files outside of the intended "languages" directory, potentially accessing sensitive files or even executing arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Validate and sanitize the `$lang` variable before using it to construct the file path. Use a whitelist approach, only allowing known, safe language codes.

2. **Use a Safe Path Construction Method:** Instead of directly concatenating user input with the directory path, use a safer method like `basename()` to ensure that the path is within the intended directory.

3. **Implement Input Validation:** Check if `$lang` is a valid file name and if it's within the allowed directory structure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
   $dir = "/home/cwe/languages";
   $lang = $_GET['lang'];
   if (preg_match("/[A-Za-z0-9]+/", $lang)) {
       include("$dir/$lang");
   } else {
       echo "You shall not pass!\n";
   }  
```
