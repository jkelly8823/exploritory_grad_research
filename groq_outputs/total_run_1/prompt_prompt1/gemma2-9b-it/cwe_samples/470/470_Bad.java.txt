VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code dynamically loads a class using the user-supplied input from the `request.getParameter("ctl")` parameter. This creates a significant security risk because an attacker could manipulate the value of the `ctl` parameter to execute arbitrary code on the server. 

By specifying a malicious class name, an attacker could potentially gain control of the server. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Never directly use user-supplied input to construct class names. Sanitize and validate the `ctl` parameter to ensure it only contains allowed values.
2. **Whitelist allowed classes:** Maintain a whitelist of permitted class names. Only load classes that are explicitly included in this whitelist.
3. **Use safer alternatives:** Consider using frameworks or libraries that provide secure mechanisms for handling dynamic class loading.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();
ao.doAction(request);
```
