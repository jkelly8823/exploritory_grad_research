VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) because it dynamically loads a class using user-supplied input (`request.getParameter("ctl")`).  An attacker could manipulate the "ctl" parameter to provide a malicious class name, which would then be loaded and executed by the application. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never directly use user input to construct class names or load classes.**
* **Sanitize and validate all user input.**  Implement strict whitelisting rules to only allow known and trusted class names.
* **Use a secure class loading mechanism.**  Consider using a system that allows controlled loading of classes from a trusted source.
* **Implement access control.** Enforce strict permissions for the loaded classes to prevent them from accessing sensitive system resources.  

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance(); 
ao.checkAccessControl(request);
ao.doAction(request);
```
