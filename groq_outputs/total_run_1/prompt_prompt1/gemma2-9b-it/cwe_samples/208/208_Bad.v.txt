VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code snippet employs a loop to compare parts of an entered password with a golden password.  
The condition `(i*8 - 1)`  within the `if` statement can lead to integer overflow if the value of `i` becomes large enough. This overflow could result in accessing memory outside the bounds of the intended `entered_pass` array, potentially causing a crash or security breach.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Bound Checking**: Implement bounds checking on the indices used to access `entered_pass` and `golden_pass`.  Make sure that `i*8 - 1`  always remains within the valid indices of the arrays.
2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Consider using modular arithmetic to ensure the index `i*8 - 1` wraps around safely if `i` becomes excessively large.

ORIGINAL CODE:

 ```
always_comb @ (posedge clk)
                    
begin
		    
                      assign check_pass[3:0] = 4'b0;
                      for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) begin
		      
                    	if (entered_pass[(i*8 - 1) : i] eq golden_pass([i*8 - 1) : i])
			
			  assign check_pass[i] = 1;
                    	  continue;
			
                    	else
			
                    	  assign check_pass[i] = 0;
                    	  break;
			
                    	end
		      
                      assign grant_access = (check_pass == 4'b1111) ? 1'b1: 1'b0;
		    
                    end
		
                end
		
		  
                ```
