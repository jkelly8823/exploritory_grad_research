VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The line `for i in len(actual_pw):` uses the result of `len(actual_pw)` directly in a `for` loop. If `len(actual_pw)` results in a very large number, this could lead to an integer overflow, causing the loop to iterate beyond the intended bounds of the password string. This can result in unintended behavior or even a security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use `range()`:**  Replace the loop with `for i in range(len(actual_pw))`:  

   ```python
   for i in range(len(actual_pw)): 
       if actual_pw[i] <> typed_pw[i]:
           return 0
   
   return 1
   ```

   This explicitly limits the loop iterations to the correct length of the password.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                 def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
		 
                   if len(actual_pw) <> len(typed_pw):
		   return 0
                   for i in len(actual_pw):
		   if actual_pw[i] <> typed_pw[i]:
		   return 0
                   
                   return 1
                 
                 
                 
               
   ```
