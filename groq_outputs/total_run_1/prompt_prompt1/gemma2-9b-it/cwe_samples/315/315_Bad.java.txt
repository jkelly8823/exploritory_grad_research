VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly embeds the user-supplied `acctID` into a cookie without any sanitization or encoding.  An attacker could potentially manipulate the `acctID` value to include malicious JavaScript code.  When the browser sends this cookie to the server, the server could inadvertently execute this malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize and encode the `acctID` value:** Before adding it to the cookie, ensure that the `acctID` is properly sanitized and encoded to prevent the execution of any potentially harmful JavaScript. 

    Here's an example using Java's `URL.encode` function to encode the value:

   ```java
   response.addCookie(new Cookie("userAccountID", URLEncoder.encode(acctID)));
   ```
    
* **Consider using HttpOnly cookies:** If this cookie is only needed on the server-side, mark it as an `HttpOnly` cookie to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing it. This mitigates some XSS risks.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  response.addCookie( new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID);  
```
