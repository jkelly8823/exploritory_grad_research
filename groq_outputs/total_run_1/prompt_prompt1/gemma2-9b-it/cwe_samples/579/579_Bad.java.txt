VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Serialization and Potential for Remote Code Execution
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability through improper serialization. By storing an instance of the `DataGlob` class directly in a session attribute using `session.setAttribute("glob", this);`, any user who can access the session could potentially deserialize this object.  

If the `DataGlob` class contains fields that can be manipulated by an attacker (e.g., fields allowing arbitrary code execution) or if untrusted data is used to construct the object, an attacker could craft malicious input and exploit this vulnerability for remote code execution (RCE).

Stored objects in sessions can be vulnerable during network transmission and when reading back from the server, increasing the risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Avoid Serializing Sensitive Data:** Do not serialize objects containing sensitive data or methods that could be exploited for malicious purposes directly into session attributes.

2. **Use Safe Serialization Techniques:** If serialization is necessary, consider using secure serialization techniques like custom serialization methods that validate and sanitize incoming data before serialization. Limit the scope of data serialized to only essential and non-executable information.

3. **Validate and Sanitize Data:** Before storing any data in a session, rigorously validate and sanitize it to prevent injection attacks and other forms of malicious manipulation.

4. **Principal of Least Privilege:** Design your code to operate with the principle of least privilege. Limit the permissions granted to the `DataGlob` class and avoid giving it any capabilities that could be abused for RCE.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  public class DataGlob {
                        String globName;String globValue;
                           public void addToSession(HttpSession session) {session.setAttribute("glob", this);}
                     } 
```
