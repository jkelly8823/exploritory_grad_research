VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The comment "<!-- FIXME: calling this with more than 30 args kills the JDBC server -->" suggests that the code is constructing a SQL query by dynamically adding arguments. If these arguments are not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially leading to data breaches or server compromise. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This involves separating the SQL code from the input data, ensuring that user-provided data is treated as data and not executable code. 
- Implement strict input validation to sanitize user data before it is used in the query. Remove any characters that are not allowed in SQL queries and ensure that data types are consistent. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
