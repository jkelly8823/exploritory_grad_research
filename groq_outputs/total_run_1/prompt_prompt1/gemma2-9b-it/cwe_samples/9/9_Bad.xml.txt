VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2,3,4,5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Security Vulnerability -  Excessive Permissions 

EXPLANATION:  
The provided code snippet exhibits a potential security vulnerability due to overly permissive method permissions. Specifically, the `method-permission` element grants the role "ANYONE" access to the `getSalary` method of the `Employee` EJB.

This broad access could allow any user, even those without appropriate authorization, to retrieve sensitive employee salary information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*  **Restrict Access:**  Refine the `role-name` attribute to specify only authorized roles that require access to employee salary data. Avoid using the generic "ANYONE" role for sensitive operations.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. 
*  **Review Permissions:** Regularly audit and review method permissions to identify and rectify any overly permissive settings.
