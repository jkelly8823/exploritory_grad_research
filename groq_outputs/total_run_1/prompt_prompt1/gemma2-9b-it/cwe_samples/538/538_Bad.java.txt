VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION:

The code snippet uses string concatenation to build a logging message that includes user-provided data (`userne` and `ccn`). Without proper sanitization, this could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. 

An attacker could craft malicious input for `userne` or `ccn` containing HTML or JavaScript code. When this data is included in the log message and displayed in the application, it could be executed in the browser of other users, potentially leading to:

* **Data theft:** Stealing user cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
* **Website defacement:** Changing the content of web pages.
* **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
* **Account takeover:** Hijacking user accounts.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using `userne` and `ccn` in the log message, sanitize them to remove any potentially harmful characters or code. This can be done using a library or function specifically designed for input sanitization.

2. **Encode Special Characters:** Instead of directly concatenating user input, encode special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"` using HTML entities. This will prevent the browser from interpreting them as code.

3. **Use Parameterized Queries:** If possible, avoid using string concatenation altogether. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing database queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```
                  logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);      
               
);
               
            
```
