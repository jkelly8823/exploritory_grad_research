VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  SQL Injection 
EXPLANATION: 

The warning message indicates a vulnerability. It states that a password attempt using the username 'root@localhost' was denied. This suggests that:  
   - Hardcoded Credentials:  The database credentials (username and password) are directly embedded within the code (likely in `database.inc` on line 4).  
   - Security Risk:  Hardcoding credentials is extremely dangerous. If an attacker gains access to this code (which could be stolen or viewed through other means), they can easily see the credentials and potentially compromise the entire database. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-  **Never Hardcode Credentials:** Remove the username and password directly from the code.

-   **Environment Variables:**  Store credentials securely in environment variables and retrieve them from there.  Make sure these environment variables are not accessible in your source code repository.
-   **Configuration Files:** Use a separate configuration file to store sensitive data. Read this file at runtime. This file should also be kept out of version control.
-     **Database Connection Pooling:** Implement a connection pooling mechanism to manage database connections more securely.
