VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `readlink($filename)` to resolve symbolic links, but it doesn't sufficiently validate the `$filename` variable. An attacker could craft a malicious symbolic link that points to a sensitive directory or file outside of the intended scope, leading to unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Validate `$filename`:**  Sanitize and validate the `$filename` parameter before using it with `readlink()` or `file_get_contents()`. Ensure it only points to paths within a predefined and secure directory structure.
* **Use safe functions:** Consider using functions like `realpath()` to resolve paths in a more secure manner. 
* **Limit access:** Enforce strict access control mechanisms based on user privileges and file ownership. Do not allow direct access to files or directories based solely on file ownership.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
                  function readFile($filename){
                        $user = getCurrentUser();
                           
                           //resolve file if its a symbolic link
                           if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
                           if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
                     }
               
}
```
