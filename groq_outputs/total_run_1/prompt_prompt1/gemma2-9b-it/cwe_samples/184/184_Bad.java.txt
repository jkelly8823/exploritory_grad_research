VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 

The code uses a simple `replaceAll()` method to replace all occurrences of the word "script" within the input string with the provided mask. This is insufficient to handle malicious JavaScript code that might be embedded within HTML script tags. An attacker could inject harmful JavaScript code disguised as part of an HTML script tag, and this code would be executed when the input is processed without proper sanitization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use a Robust Library:** Employ a dedicated HTML sanitization library to properly escape and remove potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes, including `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<iframe>`.

2. **Contextual Analysis:** Instead of a simple word replacement, analyze the context surrounding the word "script" to determine if it's part of a valid HTML tag. This can be achieved through regular expressions or dedicated HTML parsing libraries. 

3. **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize user input before processing it. Ensure that the input conforms to expected formats and remove any unexpected characters or tags.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                    public String removeScriptTags(String input, String mask) {return input.replaceAll("script", mask);}
               );}
               
               ```
