VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet has a vulnerability that could allow for Remote Code Execution (RCE). The `resourceSpecifier` property of the incoming URL is directly used in a string comparison with "specialFunction".  An attacker could craft a malicious URL with an `exampleScheme` and a `resourceSpecifier` that starts with "specialFunction" and includes arbitrary code or commands. This code could then be executed within the context of the application due to the call to `writeDataToView` which, based on the comment, seems to potentially modify the webview.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User-Controlled Input:** The `resourceSpecifier` from the URL should be thoroughly sanitized before being used.  This means removing or escaping potentially harmful characters and ensuring it adheres to a predefined whitelist of allowed values.

2. **Input Validation:**  Implement stricter input validation rules. A URL scheme of "exampleScheme" might be okay, but specific functions or actions triggered by a "specialFunction" prefix require very careful validation.  Consider using regular expressions or dedicated validation libraries where appropriate.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege:** The `writeDataToView` function should operate with the absolute minimum privileges necessary. This helps limit the potential impact of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.
4. **Consider URL Handling Patterns:** Implement secure URL handling practices, potentially using libraries or frameworks designed to handle URL data securely. Avoid directly constructing or modifying webviews based on user-supplied data.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```objectivec
    -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
        NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
            NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                
                
                // Make data available back in webview.
                UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
            }return NO;
        }return YES;
    }
```
