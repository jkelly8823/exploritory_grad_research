VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unqualified BroadCastReceiver  
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet registers a `BroadcastReceiver` without any explicit restrictions on which senders can trigger it.  This means that any app on the device could potentially send an intent matching "com.example.RemoveUser" and cause the `DeleteReceiver` to be invoked. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Limit Intent Recipients:** Add a specific component (class, activity, or service) that owns this receiver.  
  * This can be done within the `IntentFilter` using `setPackage` to restrict the allowed sender package.   
   * example: `filter.setComponent(new ComponentName("your.package.name", DeleteReceiver.class));` 

*  **Use Permissions:**  
    * If removal of user data requires permission, enforce that permission in your app's manifest. Users would need to grant explicit permission for an app to trigger this receiver.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
                     public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {@Overridepublic void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");destroyUserData(userID);}}
