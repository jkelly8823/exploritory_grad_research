VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Injection vulnerability in URL handling. 
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses substring operations to extract parts of the URL (`url.substring(0,14)` and `url.substring(14,25)`).  An attacker could craft a malicious URL designed to bypass intended checks by manipulating the substring values.  This could lead to unexpected functionality or the execution of arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize user-supplied URLs:** Never directly parse user-supplied URLs without proper sanitization. Use established libraries or techniques for URL parsing and decoding to prevent injection attacks.
* **Use parameterized queries:** If the URL is meant to be interpreted, use parameterized queries or a templating system to separate user input from the critical code logic.

ORIGINAL CODE:
               
                     // Android
                     @Overridepublic boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
                        if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){writeDataToView(view, UserData);return false;}else{return true;}}
                     }
