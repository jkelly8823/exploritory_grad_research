VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Information Leakage

EXPLANATION:
The provided code directly prints "secret information" to the console based on a simple event trigger. This could be a vulnerability if the "secret information" is indeed sensitive data. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Do not hardcode sensitive information:** Avoid directly printing sensitive data like secrets or credentials in your code. 
*   **Use Secure Logging:** If logging is necessary, use a secure logging framework that allows for proper sanitization and control over what information is logged.  

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {if (e.getSource() == button) {System.out.println("print out secret information");}}
               
               }}
               
               
               
               
```
