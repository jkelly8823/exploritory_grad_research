VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the use of user-supplied input (`$filename`) in the file path without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `$filename` parameter to access files outside the intended directory, leading to a path traversal attack.

Here's how it could be exploited:

* An attacker could provide a file path like `../../etc/passwd`, which might allow them to read sensitive system files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize File Paths:** Validate and sanitize the `$filename` parameter to ensure it only refers to files within the allowed directory structure. Use a whitelist approach, allowing only specific directories and file extensions.

2. **Use Realpath():**  Instead of directly using `readlink()`, consider using `realpath()` to resolve symbolic links and get the absolute path to the file. This adds an extra layer of security against manipulation.

3. **Limit File Access:** Implement stricter access control mechanisms to ensure that users can only access files they are authorized to view.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
function readFile($filename){
  $user = getCurrentUser();$realFile = $filename;
               
              //resolve file if its a symbolic link
              if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
              if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
}
```
