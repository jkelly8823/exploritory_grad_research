VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Sensitive Information Disclosure via System Property Injection

EXPLANATION: 
The code directly relies on the system property "com.domain.application.debugLevel". An attacker could potentially manipulate this property during runtime to inject malicious values or retrieve sensitive information. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Enforce a whitelist:** Instead of directly using the system property, create a whitelist of allowed debug levels. Validate the input against this whitelist before using it.
*   **Use a secure configuration mechanism:**  Store sensitive configuration information like debug levels in a secure configuration file or database, protected by appropriate access controls.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  int debugLevel = Integer.getInteger("com.domain.application.debugLevel").intValue();
```
