VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet reveals hardcoded credentials for LDAP access within a Java Web Application's properties file. This is a serious security vulnerability. Storing sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly in the codebase exposes them to potential attackers who could gain unauthorized access to the application and its systems.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store LDAP credentials in environment variables instead of the code. This allows for secure management and modification of credentials without compromising source code integrity.

2. **Configuration Management Tools:** Implement robust configuration management tools (e.g., Apache Ignite) that encrypt and securely store sensitive data. These tools provide centralized management and access control for configuration settings.

3. **Secrets Management Systems:** Leverage dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve credentials. Such systems offer robust access control, auditing, and rotation mechanisms.
