VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded credentials

EXPLANATION: The code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials (username and password) within the connection string. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive information directly in the code, making it vulnerable to attackers who can access the source code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Use Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables and access them within the code. This keeps the credentials separate from the source code and allows for easier management and rotation.
* **Configuration Files:**  Utilize a dedicated configuration file (e.g., .config, app.config) to store sensitive data like connection strings.  

* **Secret Management Systems:** For more robust security, consider using specialized secret management systems that provide secure storage, access control, and lifecycle management for credentials.
