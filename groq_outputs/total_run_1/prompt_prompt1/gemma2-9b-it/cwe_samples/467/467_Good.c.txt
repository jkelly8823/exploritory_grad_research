EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet you provided demonstrates the basic usage of `malloc` to allocate memory for a double pointer.  While it's good practice to check the return value of `malloc` to ensure allocation succeeded, the code itself doesn't exhibit any known vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Error Handling:** It's highly recommended to add error handling to account for potential failures of `malloc`.
    ```c
    double *foo;
    foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(*foo));
    
    if (foo == NULL) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure (e.g., log an error, terminate the program)
        perror("malloc failed"); 
        exit(1); 
    }
    ```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
double *foo;...foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(*foo)); 
```
