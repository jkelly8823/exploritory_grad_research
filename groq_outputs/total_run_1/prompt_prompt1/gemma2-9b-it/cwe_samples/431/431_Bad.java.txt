VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  
Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to reliance on InetAddress.getByName()

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `InetAddress.getByName(ip)` to resolve the hostname from the client's IP address. This method can be susceptible to a DoS attack if a malicious actor provides a malformed or excessively long hostname.  Resolving such a hostname can consume significant system resources, potentially crashing the server or making it unresponsive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Validate and sanitize the `ip` variable before using it in `InetAddress.getByName()`. This involves:
    * Ensuring the input is a valid IP address format.
    * Limiting the length of the input to prevent extremely long hostnames.

2. **Consider Alternative Resolution:** Explore alternatives to `InetAddress.getByName()` that are more robust against DoS attacks, such as using a DNS resolver with rate-limiting or caching mechanisms.


ORIGINAL CODE:


```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
  String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
  InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
 ...
  out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}
```
