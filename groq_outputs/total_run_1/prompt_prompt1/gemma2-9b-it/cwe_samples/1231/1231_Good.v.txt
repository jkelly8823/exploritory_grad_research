VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Redeclaration of `j`
EXPLANATION: 
The variable `j` is declared as a loop counter within the `for` loop on line 4.  However, the loop counter will need to be reset before the next iteration of the loop. On line 8, `j` is given a new definition, leading to a redeclaration error. This may cause unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Change `j=j+1` to `j<= j+1` inside the `for` loop to properly increment the counter. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk_i)
    begin
            if(~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock))
                begin
                    for (j=0; j < 6; j=j+1) begin
                        reglk_mem[j] <= 'h0;
                    
                end
                
                   
    end...
    ...
```
