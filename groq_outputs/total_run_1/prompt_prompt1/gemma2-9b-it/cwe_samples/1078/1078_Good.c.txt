VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the `fgets` function does not explicitly check for the maximum buffer size before reading user input.  If a user enters more than 1024 characters, the excess data will overwrite memory beyond the allocated space for the `buffer` array. This can lead to crashes, unpredictable program behavior, or allow an attacker to inject malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Ensure `fgets` input is always less than the buffer size:** Before calling `fgets`, limit the maximum number of characters read using a smaller size. This can be done using a safer alternative like `fgets_s` (if available).


2. **Sanitize user input:**  Always validate and sanitize user input to ensure it meets expected formatting and length requirements.  



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  enum { MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 1024 };
                  char buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];
                  fgets(buffer, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, stdin);
```
