VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. The `fgets` function reads user input from standard input (`stdin`) and stores it in the `buffer` variable. However, the buffer size is fixed at 1024 characters. If a user enters more than 1024 characters, the extra data will overflow the allocated memory for the `buffer`, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and leading to crashes or malicious code execution.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Limit Input Size:** Use a fixed-size input buffer and ensure that user input doesn't exceed its capacity. It's crucial to validate and sanitize user input before processing it.

2. **Bound Checking:** Implement bounds checking to prevent writing beyond the allocated memory space of the buffer. 

3. **Safe Input Functions:** Consider using safer alternatives to `fgets` like `fgets_s` (from the C standard library) which provide built-in bounds checking to mitigate buffer overflow risks.





ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char buffer[1024];...fgets(buffer, 1024, stdin);
               
);
               
               
```
