VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `run_ping_regex` function uses the user-supplied `ip` string directly within the `subprocess.call` command.  This means an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the `ping` command.

For example, if a user provides the input `192.168.1.1; rm -rf /`, the code would execute  `ping 192.168.1.1; rm -rf /`, potentially leading to the deletion of all files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize user input:**  Before using the `ip` string in any commands, carefully sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or patterns. This could involve using a whitelist of allowed characters or using a dedicated library for input validation.

* **Use parameterized queries:**  If possible, avoid directly embedding user input into commands. Instead, use parameterized queries or other mechanisms that separate user data from the command itself.

ORIGINAL CODE:
	  



		  import subprocess
		  import re
		  
		  def validate_ip_regex(ip: str):
		  
		    ip_validator = re.compile(r"((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}")
		    if ip_validator.match(ip):
		    
		      return ip
		    
		    else:
		    
		      raise ValueError("IP address does not match valid pattern.")
		  
		  
		  
		  def run_ping_regex(ip: str):
		  
		    validated = validate_ip_regex(ip)
		    # The ping command treats zero-prepended IP addresses as octal
		    result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
		    print(result)
