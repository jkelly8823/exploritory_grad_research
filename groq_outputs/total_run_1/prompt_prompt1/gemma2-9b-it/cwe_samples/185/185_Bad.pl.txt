VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `system("lookup-phone $phone");` to execute a command with the user-provided `$phone` variable. This is highly vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could provide a malformed phone number that includes malicious commands, which would then be executed by the system. For example, an attacker could provide a phone number like `123-456-7890; rm -rf /` which would delete all files on the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `system()`, consider using a more secure method for executing commands, such as the `exec()` function with careful input sanitization. 

* **Sanitize the input:**  Use functions like `escapeshellarg()` to escape potentially dangerous characters in the `$phone` variable before passing it to the `lookup-phone` command.
* **Use an alternative:**  Explore using dedicated libraries for phone number lookup that handle command execution more securely. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
   
                  $phone = GetPhoneNumber();if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
                        # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
                        system("lookup-phone $phone");}
				  else {error("malformed number!");}
}
