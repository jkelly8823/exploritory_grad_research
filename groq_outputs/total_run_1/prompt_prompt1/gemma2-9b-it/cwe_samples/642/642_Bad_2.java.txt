VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses `fis.read(arr)` to read data from a file into an array `arr`. The primary issue lies in the fact that there's no check on the size of the file or the capacity of the `arr` before performing the read operation. If the file content exceeds the size of `arr`, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. 

A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to write more data into a buffer (in this case, the `arr`) than it can hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting data or even allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Size Validation:**  Determine the maximum size of the file you expect and ensure the `arr` has sufficient capacity to hold it. You can achieve this by:
   - Using `fis.available()` to get the file size before reading.
   - Reading data in chunks and validating the size of each chunk.

2. **Bounded Reads:**  Use methods like `fis.read(arr, 0, maxBytes)` to explicitly limit the number of bytes read into the array. This prevents reading beyond the allocated buffer space.

3. **Defensive Programming:**  Consider using libraries or frameworks that provide built-in protection against buffer overflows. These often include safe reading functions and memory management strategies.

```java
fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt");amt = fis.read(arr);out.println(arr);
