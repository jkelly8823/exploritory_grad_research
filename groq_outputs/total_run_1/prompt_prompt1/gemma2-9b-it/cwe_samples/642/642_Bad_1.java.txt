VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  Lines 1-4, specifically these lines mentioning the use of `request.getParameter("reportName")` and the subsequent file operations.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct Object Reference (DOR) vulnerability combined with a Potential for File Deletion.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a significant security risk due to the direct use of user-supplied input (`request.getParameter("reportName")`) in constructing the file path (`/usr/local/apfr/reports/` + rName).

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Direct Object Reference (DOR):**  When the user provides a malicious file name, it could lead to unauthorized access or deletion of unintended files. For example, an attacker could craft a request like `reportName=../../etc/passwd`, potentially giving them access to the sensitive system file `/etc/passwd`.

2. **Potential for File Deletion:** The code directly calls `rFile.delete()`.  This means an attacker could potentially delete existing files on the system by supplying a malicious file name.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using `rName` in the file path, rigorously sanitize and validate the user input. This involves:
    - **Input Length Validation:** Limit the length of the input to prevent overly long file names that might trigger issues.
    - **Character Set Validation:** Only allow alphanumeric characters and safe symbols, preventing the use of potentially harmful characters that could lead to directory traversal attacks.
    - **Allowlisted Extensions:** If necessary, restrict file extensions to known and safe types, further mitigating the risk of malicious file uploads. 2.  **Use Prepared Statements (if applicable):** If using a database, employ parameterized queries (prepared statements) to avoid directly embedding user input into SQL queries. This prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.

3. **Restrict File Access:** Consider using more restrictive file permissions on the `/usr/local/apfr/reports/` directory to limit write access, potentially mitigating the impact of a successful file deletion.
4. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging to track file access and any potential modifications. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);...rFile.delete();
