VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Exposure of Server Errors to Clients

EXPLANATION:
The `<customErrors mode="Off" />` configuration disables the built-in custom error handling mechanism provided by the ASP.NET framework. This means that when exceptions or errors occur within the application, instead of showing a user-friendly customized error message, the raw server error details will be displayed to the client.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Enable Custom Errors with Specific Error Messages:** Instead of disabling custom errors entirely, configure your web.config file to handle specific error types and display appropriate custom messages to users. This can help protect sensitive information and provide a better user experience. 
   ```xml
   <customErrors mode="On">
       <error statusCode="404" redirect="~/NotFound.aspx" />
       <error statusCode="500" redirect="~/ServerError.aspx" />
   </customErrors>
   ```

2. **Log Errors Centrally:** Implement robust logging mechanisms to capture all server-side errors. This allows you to monitor and analyze errors effectively, identify trends, and resolve issues promptly.  

3. **Consider a Distributed Tracing System:** Utilize a distributed tracing system to gain deeper insights into application errors, particularly in complex microservice architectures. This can help pinpoint the source of errors and improve debugging efficiency.
