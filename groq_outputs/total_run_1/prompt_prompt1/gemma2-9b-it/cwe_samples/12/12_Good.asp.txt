VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Remote Only Custom Errors 
EXPLANATION:
The  `mode="RemoteOnly"` attribute within the `<customErrors />` tag presents a potential vulnerability. Enabling "RemoteOnly" mode means the web application will only display custom error pages to users making requests from remote sources (external websites).  

This leaves internal system errors potentially unmasked to local administrators and developers. Malicious users may leverage this to obfuscate the true nature of errors, potentially hindering debugging and security assessments. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Re-evaluate Custom Error Handling:** Consider whether "RemoteOnly" mode is truly necessary. It might be safer to log these errors appropriately and present generic error messages for both internal and external users. 

* **Detailed Logging:** Implement robust logging of all errors, regardless of their source. This provides a comprehensive audit trail for debugging and incident response.

* **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the user accounts performing web server administration or debugging have the minimum privileges required to access error logs.

* **Security Headers:** Implement comprehensive security headers such as `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking vulnerabilities, further enhancing security.
