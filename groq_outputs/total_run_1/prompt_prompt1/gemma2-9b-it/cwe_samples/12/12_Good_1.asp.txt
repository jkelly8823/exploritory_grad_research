VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
The `defaultRedirect` attribute in the `<customErrors>` tag is directly exposed in the response if an error occurs. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into this attribute, which would be executed by the browser when a user is redirected to YourErrorPage.htm.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:**  Never directly use user-supplied data in URLs or attributes. Sanitize any input before using it in the `defaultRedirect` attribute. This means escaping special characters that could be interpreted as HTML code.
* **Use an Error Handling Framework:** Consider using a robust error handling framework that provides built-in protection against XSS vulnerabilities. These frameworks often have mechanisms for escaping output and handling redirects safely. 


ORIGINAL CODE:

```html
                  <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" />
               
            ```
