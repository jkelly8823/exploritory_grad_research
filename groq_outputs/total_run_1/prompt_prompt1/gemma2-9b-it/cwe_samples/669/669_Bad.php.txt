VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. The `$username` and `$password` variables are directly concatenated into the SQL query without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to:

   - Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
   - Modify or delete existing data.
   - Take control of the database server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This involves separating the SQL code from the user input and using placeholders that are then filled with sanitized values.

Original code:

```php
//assume the password is already encrypted, avoiding CWE-312

function authenticate($username,$password){
   include("http://external.example.com/dbInfo.php");
   
   //dbInfo.php makes $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname available
   mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');mysql_select_db($dbname);$query = 'Select * from users where username='.$username.' And password='.$password;$result = mysql_query($query);
   if(mysql_numrows($result) == 1){mysql_close();return true;}else{mysql_close();return false;}
}
  
```


Let me know if you'd like me to demonstrate how to fix the code with parameterized queries.
