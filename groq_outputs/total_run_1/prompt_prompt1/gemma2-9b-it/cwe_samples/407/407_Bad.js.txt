VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `/^(\w+\s?)*$/i` is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. The `*` quantifier allows for zero or more occurrences of the preceding group `(\w+\s?)`. If `test_string` contains a large number of characters matching the pattern (alphanumeric characters followed by an optional whitespace), the regex engine could spend an excessive amount of time processing the string, leading to a denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-  Refine the regular expression to limit the number of potential matches. For example, you could use a fixed maximum number of repetitions or a more specific pattern. 
-  Use a library or tool designed to mitigate ReDoS vulnerabilities.

  ORIGINAL CODE: 
               var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
               var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
               var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
