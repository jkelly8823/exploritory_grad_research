VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `good_pattern`,  `^(?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i`, is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. The pattern contains a recursive backreference `\2` which can be exploited by crafting a malicious input string that causes the regex engine to execute an exponential number of iterations. This can lead to significant performance degradation or even denial of service.

Specifically, the pattern matches any string where:
- It starts with one or more word characters (`\w+`)
- Followed by optional repetitions of the same word character sequence (the recursion with `\2`) followed by a space


RECOMMENDATIONS:
-   **Refactor the Regular Expression:** Avoid using recursive backreferences if possible.  Try to break down the pattern into smaller, less complex components.  
-   **Sanitize Input:** Implement input validation and sanitization to protect against malicious inputs that could trigger ReDoS. Carefully examine the format and content of any data that is used in the regular expression.


ORIGINAL CODE: 

```javascript
var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
var result = test_string.search(good_pattern);
             
             );
             
             
             
```
