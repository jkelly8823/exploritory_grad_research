VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `good_pattern = /(((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*)/i;`  allows for potential unbounded repetitions due to the backreference `\2`. If a maliciously crafted input string contains many repetitions of `\w+`, the regex engine might get stuck in an infinite loop trying to match the pattern, leading to a denial of service. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:**  Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious patterns from being injected.

2. **Use more robust regular expressions:** Avoid complex patterns with unbounded repetition. Consider using a more restrictive regex that limits the number of repetitions or employs special techniques like lookaheads to prevent infinite loops.
3. **Employ regex optimization:**  Some regex engines allow for optimization techniques to mitigate ReDoS vulnerabilities. Ensure your regex engine supports such features.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
               var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
               var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
               var result = test_string.search(good_pattern);
             
             );
             
             
             
             ```
