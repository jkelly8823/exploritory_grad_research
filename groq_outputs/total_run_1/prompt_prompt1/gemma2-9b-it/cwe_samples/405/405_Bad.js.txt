VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION:  The regular expression `/^(\w+\s?)*$/i`  is susceptible to a ReDoS vulnerability. Specifically, the repetition `(\w+\s?)*` could match an extremely long string of alphanumeric characters and whitespace, leading to a high time complexity and potential resource exhaustion if a malicious user crafts a specially crafted input.

RECcommendations:
* **Use a more specific regular expression:** Consider the exact format and content of the input you expect and tailor your regular expression accordingly. Avoid using excessive wildcards or unbounded repetition.
   * For example, if you only want to match strings containing only ASCII alphanumeric characters and spaces: `/\A[A-Za-z0-9\s]+\z/i` 
* **Employ a safe regex library:** Many programming languages offer libraries specifically designed to mitigate ReDoS vulnerabilities.
* **Validate and Sanitize Input:** Always sanitize and validate user input to prevent attackers from injecting malicious patterns.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern); 
```
