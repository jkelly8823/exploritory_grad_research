VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Possible Redundancy and Overlapping Logic

EXPLANATION: 
The code contains two `if` statements that seem to check the same condition (`r > 0.0` and `r > 1.0`).  If both conditions are meant to be independent, they might lead to unexpected behavior if the value of 'r' falls in the overlapping range (greater than 1.0). 


Furthermore, both `if` blocks calculate the same `surface_area` expression. This suggests potential redundancy and a lack of clarity in the intended logic.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Re-evaluate the logic:** 
   * Determine if the conditions in both `if` statements are truly independent or if there's an intention to combine them.
   * Clarify the purpose of each calculation: 
     * Are both `surface_area` calculations intended to be used in different parts of the program?
     *  Or is there an error, and only one should be used?
2. **Refactor for Clarity:** 
   * Use conditional logic (like a single `if-else` statement) to handle the calculation of `surface_area` based on the specific conditions required.

ORIGINAL CODE:  

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double s = 10.0;
        double r = 1.0;
        double pi = 3.14159;
        double surface_area;
        if(r > 0.0) {
           // complex math equations
           surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
        }
        if(r > 1.0) {
           // a complex set of math
           surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
        }
    }
} 
```
