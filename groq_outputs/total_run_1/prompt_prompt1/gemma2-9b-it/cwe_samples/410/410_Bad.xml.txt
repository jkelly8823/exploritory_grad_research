VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded credentials 
EXPLANATION: The code snippet stores the database user name ("testuser") and password ("testpass") directly within the XML configuration file.  This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive information directly in the code, making it vulnerable to attackers who might gain access to the file. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Use environment variables:** Store the database credentials in environment variables and retrieve them at runtime.
* **Configuration File Management:**  Consider using a separate configuration file for sensitive data, and store this file securely (e.g., encrypted) outside the main application directory.
* **Secret Management Systems:** Implement a dedicated secret management system to securely store and retrieve sensitive information like database credentials.
