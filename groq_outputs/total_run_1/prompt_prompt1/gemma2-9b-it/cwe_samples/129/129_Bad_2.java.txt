VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Variable Shadowing 
EXPLANATION: 
A variable named `productSummary` is declared both inside the `displayProductSummary` method and within the `try` block. This is a case of variable shadowing, where a local variable hides a variable with the same name from an outer scope. As a result, the `productSummary` variable declared outside the `try` block will never be modified and the code will unintentionally return an empty string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Rename the `productSummary` variable inside the `try` block to avoid shadowing the outer variable.  For example, you could use `internalProductSummary`.  

  Here's a corrected version:

```java
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {

    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {
        String internalProductSummary = getProductSummary(index); 
        productSummary = internalProductSummary; // Assign to outer variable
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Handle the exception appropriately
    }
    return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    return products[index];
}
```

- If the intention was to create a new `productSummary` variable within the `try` block, consider removing the declaration outside the `try` block.
  



ORIGINAL CODE:

                  
                     
                     // Method called from servlet to obtain product information
                     public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
                     
                        String productSummary = new String("");
                           try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
                           
                           } catch (Exception ex) {...}
                           return productSummary;
                     }
                     public String getProductSummary(int index) {return products[index];}
