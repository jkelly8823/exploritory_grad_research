VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Concurrent Modification Exception

EXPLANATION: 

There is a potential issue in the `displayProductSummary` method where it attempts to obtain a `productSummary` string both locally and through a function call.  This could lead to a ConcurrentModificationException if product information is being updated concurrently with these read operations. While the `getProductSummary` method handles out-of-bounds indexing, the reuse of the same `productSummary` variable name within both the `displayProductSummary` method and its tried block introduces a potential for conflicts.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Rename Local Variable:** Rename the local `productSummary` variable in the `displayProductSummary` method to a different name (e.g., `localProductSummary`) to avoid name collisions.

2. **Review Concurrency:** If the `products` array is subject to concurrent modifications (e.g., updates from multiple threads), consider implementing synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, atomic operations) to protect access to the `products` array.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  
                     
                     // Method called from servlet to obtain product information
                     public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
                     
                        String productSummary = new String("");
                           try {String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
                           
                           } catch (Exception ex) {...}
                           return productSummary;
                     }
                     public String getProductSummary(int index) {
                        String productSummary = "";
                           if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {productSummary = products[index];}else {System.err.println("index is out of bounds");throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();}
                           return productSummary;
                     }
}
