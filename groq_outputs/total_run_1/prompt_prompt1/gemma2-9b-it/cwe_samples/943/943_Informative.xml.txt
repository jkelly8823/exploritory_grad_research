VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct Storage of Sensitive Information
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet directly stores plaintext usernames and passwords within XML tags. This is a critical security vulnerability because it exposes sensitive user credentials in a readily accessible format. An attacker who gains access to this data could easily extract and use the usernames and passwords for malicious purposes such as unauthorized login attempts.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Implement robust data security practices by never storing passwords in plaintext. 
1. **Hashing:**hash passwords using a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or Argon2 before storing them.
2. **Salting:**  Use unique salts for each password hash to prevent common attacks like rainbow table lookups.
3. **Encryption:** Encrypt the entire user data structure using a strong encryption algorithm. This ensures that even if the data is accessed, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key.
