VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential LDAP Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly constructs the LDAP search filter string using user-supplied input (`address`). This opens the possibility for an attacker to inject malicious LDAP filter expressions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or even system compromise.

For example, an attacker could craft a malicious `address` input like:

 `"StreetAddress=*(\\*)&")(true"`

This crafted input might bypass intended authentication checks or access unintended data within the LDAP directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before constructing the LDAP search filter, rigorously sanitize the `address` input to remove any potentially dangerous characters or sequences.


2. **Prepared Statements:**  Consider using parameterized LDAP search queries. This helps prevent direct injection of user data into the search filter string, effectively mitigating the vulnerability. 

3. **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation rules to ensure that `address` conforms to the expected format and does not contain any LDAP injection-like patterns.



  ORIGINAL CODE: 
  `context = new InitialDirContext(env);String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address;NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);`
