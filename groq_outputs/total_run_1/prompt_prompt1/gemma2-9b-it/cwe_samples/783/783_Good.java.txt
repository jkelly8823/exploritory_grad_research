VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  Line Number Containing Vulnerability 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Division by Zero Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calculates the return on investment (ROI) by dividing the difference between the current value and the initial investment by the initial investment. The vulnerability arises because if the `initialInvestment` value is zero, the division operation will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Add a Check for Zero Initial Investment:**  Before performing the division, add a check to ensure that `initialInvestment` is not equal to zero. If it is, handle the situation appropriately (e.g., return a default value of 0 or raise a specific error indicating an invalid input).
  

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
...
returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
...
```
