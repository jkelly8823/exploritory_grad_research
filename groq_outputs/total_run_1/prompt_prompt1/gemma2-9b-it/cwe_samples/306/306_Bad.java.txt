VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive Data Exposure - The `setAccountOwnerSSN` method is storing and exposing a user's Social Security Number (SSN) directly in the account object. 

EXPLANATION:

SSNs are highly sensitive personal identifiers. Storing them directly in the `BankAccount` object poses a significant risk of data breaches. If an attacker gains access to the database or the application's internal memory, they could potentially steal SSNs. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Do not store SSNs directly**:  Instead of storing the full SSN, consider using a hash function to generate a unique identifier from the SSN. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to extract the original SSN even if they compromise the database.

2. **Implement secure data handling practices**: 
    * Encrypt SSNs both at rest (in the database) and in transit (between the application and the database).
    * Implement strict access controls to limit who can view and modify SSN data.
    * Regularly audit your code and systems for potential vulnerabilities.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public BankAccount createBankAccount(String accountNumber, String accountType,String accountName, String accountSSN, double balance) {
                     
                        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();account.setAccountNumber(accountNumber);account.setAccountType(accountType);account.setAccountOwnerName(accountName);account.setAccountOwnerSSN(accountSSN);account.setBalance(balance);
                           return account;
                     }
               
               ```
