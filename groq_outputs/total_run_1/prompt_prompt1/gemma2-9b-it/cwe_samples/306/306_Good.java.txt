VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Sensitive Data Exposure - Account SSN

EXPLANATION:  
The code directly exposes the account Social Security Number (SSN) without any input validation or encryption. This poses a significant risk of sensitive data exposure if the `accountOwnerSSN` is inadvertently revealed during runtime or through unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation to ensure the `accountSSN` contains only alphanumeric characters and adheres to the expected SSN format.
* **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Encrypt the `accountSSN` both in storage and during transmission. Store it in an encrypted database and use appropriate cryptographic methods to protect it when it is being processed or displayed.
* **Limit Data Exposure:** Avoid storing SSNs if it is not absolutely necessary. Consider using alternative identifiers where possible. If an SSN must be stored, ensure it is stored securely and accessibly only by authorized personnel.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  private boolean isUserAuthentic = false;
                     
                     // authenticate user,
                     
                     
                     // if user is authenticated then set variable to true
                     
                     
                     // otherwise set variable to false
                     public boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {...}
                     public BankAccount createNewBankAccount(String accountNumber, String accountType,String accountName, String accountSSN, double balance) {
                        BankAccount account = null;
                           if (isUserAuthentic) {account = new BankAccount();account.setAccountNumber(accountNumber);account.setAccountType(accountType);account.setAccountOwnerName(accountName);account.setAccountOwnerSSN(accountSSN);account.setBalance(balance);}return account;
                     }
