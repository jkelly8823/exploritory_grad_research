VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code uses an untrusted input, `$username`, in both the print and die statements, potentially leading to a vulnerability like format string injection or command injection. 

EXPLANATION: 

* **Line 2**: `PrintLog("auth: username=%s, result=%d", $username, $result);` uses `%s` to format the `$username` variable. If `$username` contains malicious input, it could manipulate the formatting and potentially execute unintended code.

* **Line 3**: `if (($result ne "success") && $fatal) {die "Failed!\n";}`  directly uses potentially untrusted input within the `die` statement. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

1. **Sanitize User Input**: Always sanitize and validate user-supplied input (`$username`) before using it in any context, especially within print statements and string formatting mechanisms.  You should validate against a whitelist of acceptable values.

2. **Escaping**: In situations where you need to include user input in strings, escape any special characters that could be interpreted as commands or formatting codes.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
sub ReportAuth {my ($username, $result, $fatal) = @_;
PrintLog("auth: username=%s, result=%d", $username, $result);
if (($result ne "success") && $fatal) {die "Failed!\n";}}

sub PrivilegedFunc{
my $result = CheckAuth($username);
ReportAuth($username, $result, 0);
DoReallyImportantStuff();}
```
