VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:Dangling Pointer Dereference Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
 The code snippet exhibits a potential dangling pointer dereference vulnerability. When the `sh()` function is executed, it attempts to free `global1` and `global2`. However, it does not guarantee that these pointers are still valid after the free operations. If another part of the program attempts to access `global1` or `global2` after they have been freed, it will lead to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior.

This is particularly concerning because the `sleep()` statements might allow for race conditions, where a program could attempt to access the pointers before they are freed.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that all pointers used in the program are properly managed and no dangling pointers are created. 
* Employ memory management techniques such as smart pointers or reference counting to automatically handle memory deallocation and prevent dangling pointers. In this specific case, carefully consider the scope of `global1` and `global2` and whether they need to exist beyond the execution of the `main()` function.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  #include <signal.h>#include <syslog.h>#include <string.h>#include <stdlib.h>
                     void *global1, *global2;char *what;void sh (int dummy) {
                        syslog(LOG_NOTICE,"%s\n",what);free(global2);free(global1);
                           /* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */
                           
                           sleep(10);exit(0);
                     }
                     int main (int argc,char* argv[]) {
                        what=argv[1];global1=strdup(argv[2]);global2=malloc(340);signal(SIGHUP,sh);signal(SIGTERM,sh);
                           /* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */
                           
                           sleep(10);exit(0);
                     }
