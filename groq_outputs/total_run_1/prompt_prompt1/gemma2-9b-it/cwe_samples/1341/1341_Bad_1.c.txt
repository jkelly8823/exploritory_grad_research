VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Free

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a double free vulnerability.  This occurs when memory allocated with `malloc` is freed twice. 

In this case:

1. `malloc(SIZE)` allocates a block of memory and stores its address in the `ptr` variable.
2.  The `if (abrt) {free(ptr);}` block checks a condition (`abrt`). If it's true, the memory pointed to by `ptr` is freed.
3. Regardless of the value of `abrt`, the code then proceeds to `free(ptr);` again. This attempts to free the same memory location twice, leading to a double free.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Remove the Redundant `free(ptr);`:**
   Simply remove the second `free(ptr);` statement to avoid the double free vulnerability.

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
// ... rest of your code ...
if (abrt) { free(ptr); } 
```


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
```
