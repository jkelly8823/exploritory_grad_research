VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Close File

EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates  a potential issue where a file is closed twice within a single context. This is often referred to as a double-close, which can lead to unexpected behavior. After successfully closing file 'dbl_cls.c', the line `int r2 = fclose(f);` attempts to close the file again. Although the operating system might handle this gracefully in some cases, it's best practice to avoid closing a file more than once.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the line `int r2 = fclose(f);` to avoid the double close operation. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char b[2000];
FILE *f = fopen("dbl_cls.c", "r");
if (f)
{
	b[0] = 0;
	fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);
	printf("%s\n'", b);
	int r1 = fclose(f);
	printf("\n-----------------\n1 close done '%d'\n", r1);
	int r2 = fclose(f);	// Double close
	printf("2 close done '%d'\n", r2);
}
					
}
					
```
