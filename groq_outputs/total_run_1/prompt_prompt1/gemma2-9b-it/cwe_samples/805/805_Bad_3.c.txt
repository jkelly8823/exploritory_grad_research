VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `strncpy()` to copy the `filename` into the `buf` buffer.  However, `strncpy()` does not automatically null-terminate the string if the source string (`filename`) is longer than the destination buffer (`buf`). If `length` is greater than `LOG_INPUT_SIZE` (40), this will result in a buffer overflow.

An attacker could craft a `filename` that exceeds 40 characters, overwriting adjacent memory locations. This could lead to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even the execution of malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1.  **Use a safer string copying function:** Instead of `strncpy()`, use `snprintf()` to copy the string into the buffer, specifying the maximum size of the buffer. This function will automatically null-terminate the string if it exceeds the buffer size, preventing a buffer overflow.

   ```c
   snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", filename); 
   ```

2. **Input Validation:** Always validate the length of user-supplied input before copying it into buffers. Reject input that exceeds the maximum allowed size.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#define LOG_INPUT_SIZE 40
     
     // saves the file name to a log file
     int outputFilenameToLog(char *filename, int length) {
        int success;
           
           // buffer with size set to maximum size for input to log file
           char buf[LOG_INPUT_SIZE];
           
           // copy filename to buffer
           strncpy(buf, filename, length);
           
           // save to log file
           success = saveToLogFile(buf);
           return success;
     }
```
