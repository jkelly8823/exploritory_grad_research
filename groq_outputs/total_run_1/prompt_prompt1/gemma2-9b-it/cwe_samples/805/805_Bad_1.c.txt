VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` call is used to determine the size of a buffer (`destBuf`) but it's then being used in a `memcpy` call with `returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1`.  This subtraction could easily lead to a buffer overflow. If `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns a value that is small or equal to 1, the subtraction will result in a negative value. However, `memcpy` will still attempt to copy data from `srcBuf` into `destBuf`, potentially writing over memory beyond the allocated bounds of `destBuf`, leading to a buffer overflow. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate the return value of `returnChunkSize`**: Always ensure `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns a positive value before using it in `memcpy`.  
2. **Bounds checking during copying**: Implement bounds checking within the `main` function to prevent copying beyond the allocated size of `destBuf`. For example:
    ```c
    const int max_copy = returnChunkSize(destBuf) - 1; // Determine safe copy size
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, max_copy ); 
    ```
3. **Consider using safer alternatives**:  Explore safer string manipulation functions like `strncpy` which offer built-in bounds checking.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                  int returnChunkSize(void *) {
                        
                           
                           /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
                           
                           
                           * else, return -1 to indicate an error
                           
                           
                           */
                           ...
                     }int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
               
               ...}
