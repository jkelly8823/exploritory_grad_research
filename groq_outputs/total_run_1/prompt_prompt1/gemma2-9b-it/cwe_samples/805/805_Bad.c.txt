VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The `strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);` line is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.  The `hostname` buffer is fixed at 64 characters, but `hp->h_name` could potentially be longer. If `hp->h_name` is longer than 64 characters, `strcpy` will write beyond the bounds of the `hostname` buffer, overwriting adjacent memory. This can lead to crashes or allow an attacker to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`. `strncpy` allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing buffer overflows. For example:

```c
strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, sizeof(hostname) - 1);
hostname[sizeof(hostname) - 1] = '\0';
```

This code copies at most 63 characters from `hp->h_name` into `hostname`, leaving space for the null terminator.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
                        struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
                           
                           /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */
                           
                           validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
                     }
               }
```
