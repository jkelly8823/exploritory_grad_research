VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directly reading a password from a plain text configuration file ("config.properties").
EXPLANATION:  

The code reads a database password directly from a file named "config.properties". This poses a significant security risk because:

* **Plaintext Exposure:** The password is stored in the file in plain text, making it easily accessible to anyone with access to the file system.

* **Improper Storage:** Storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text configuration files is a weak security practice.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Encrypt the Password:** Encrypt the password in the "config.properties" file before storing it. Use a strong encryption algorithm and securely manage the encryption keys.

2. **Use Environment Variables:** Store the password as an environment variable instead of a configuration file. This allows for better security controls and prevents the password from being directly stored on disk.

3. **Use a Secure Secrets Manager:**  For production environments, consider using a dedicated secrets manager service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and retrieve sensitive data like passwords.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 
                  ...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = Base64.decode(prop.getProperty("password"));DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);......  




 Remember, never store passwords in plain text directly in your codebase.
