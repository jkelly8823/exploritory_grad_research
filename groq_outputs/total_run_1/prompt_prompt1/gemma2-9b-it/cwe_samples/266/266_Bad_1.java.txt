VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Improper use of sendBroadcast() with a URI permission. This allows for potential malicious apps to access sensitive user data.
EXPLANATION:
The code broadcasts a `Intent` with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`, which grants read access to the specified file URI to any app that receives the broadcast. This is a significant security risk as it allows potentially malicious apps to access sensitive user data stored at the provided URI.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Avoid using sendBroadcast() for sharing sensitive data.**  Consider using more secure mechanisms like content providers, file-sharing APIs, or secure inter-process communication (IPC) if necessary.
* **If using sendBroadcast() for critical operations, restrict the receivers:**  Use a unique action that only your trusted apps should handle. Additionally, implement strong permission checks on the receiving end to ensure only authorized apps access the data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction("com.example.BackupUserData");intent.setData(file_uri);intent.addFlags(FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);sendBroadcast(intent););
```
