VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code retrieves the value of a cookie named "role" without sanitizing it.  An attacker could manipulate the "role" cookie value to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code.  This could allow the attacker to steal user data, hijack user sessions, or deface the website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize the cookie value:** Use a safe encoding method to prevent the execution of malicious JavaScript code. For example, use `HttpUtil.htmlEncode(c.getValue())` to encode the cookie value before using it. 
    

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();for (int i =0; i< cookies.length; i++) {Cookie c = cookies[i];if (c.getName().equals("role")) {userRole = c.getValue();}}
               
            }}
               
            
               
            ``` 



Let me know if you'd like to see examples of how to sanitize the cookie value in different programming languages.
