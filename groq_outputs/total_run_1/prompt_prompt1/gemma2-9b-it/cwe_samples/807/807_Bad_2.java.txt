VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Trust Boundary Violation
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly trusts an IP address obtained from the `request.getRemoteAddr()` function. An attacker could potentially manipulate the value received from `request.getRemoteAddr()`, allowing them to bypass intended security checks by making it appear as if the request originates from a trusted source ("trustme.com"). 

This vulnerability arises from a lack of thorough validation and reliance on untrusted input (the client's IP address). 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize and Validate Input:**  Never directly trust user-provided data, including IP addresses. Implement robust input validation to ensure the IP address format is correct and to verify its authenticity against a known list of trusted sources.
2. **Use IP Reputation Services:** Consider integrating with an IP reputation service to check the reputation of the connecting IP address. This can provide additional insights into whether the IP is associated with malicious activity.
3. **Implement Strict Access Control:** Employ access control mechanisms based on factors beyond just IP addresses. This could involve using authentication tokens, OAuth, or other methods to verify user identity and authorization.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
                  InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
                  if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
                      trusted = true;
                  }                   
```
