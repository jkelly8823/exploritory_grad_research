VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow 
EXPLANATION: 
The `if (value=100)` statement is using the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the comparison operator (`==`). This will cause the variable `value` to be assigned a value of 100.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Change `value=100` to `value == 100` to correctly compare the value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
               
);}
