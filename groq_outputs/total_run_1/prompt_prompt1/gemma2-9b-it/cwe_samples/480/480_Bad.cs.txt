VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Incorrect use of the assignment operator (=) inside the conditional statement.
EXPLANATION: 
The line `if (value=100) {` uses the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the comparison operator (`==`) to check if the value is equal to 100. This will result in a compilation error and won't correctly evaluate the condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line `if (value=100) {` to `if (value == 100) {` to use the correct comparison operator.
ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  bool isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {Console.WriteLine("Value is valid.");return true;}Console.WriteLine("Value is not valid.");return false;}
               
               ```
