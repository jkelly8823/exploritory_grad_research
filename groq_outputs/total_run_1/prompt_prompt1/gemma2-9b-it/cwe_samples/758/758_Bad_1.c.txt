VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `getName()` function allocates a fixed-size character array `name` with a size of `STR_MAX`. However, it calls `fillInName(name)` which may write more than `STR_MAX` characters into the buffer. This leads to a buffer overflow, where data written beyond the allocated memory can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or even security exploits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use `snprintf` or Similar Functions:** Replace the direct writing to `name` with functions like `snprintf` that take a maximum length argument, preventing overflows.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   char* getName() {
       char name[STR_MAX]; 
       snprintf(name, sizeof(name), "%s", fillInName()); // Limit write to buffer size
       return name;
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** If the size of the name is unpredictable, allocate memory dynamically using `malloc`. Ensure to free the allocated memory when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  char* getName() {char name[STR_MAX];fillInName(name);return name;}
               
;}
               
            ```
