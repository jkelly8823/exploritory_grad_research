EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates basic exception handling. It uses a `try-catch` structure to handle potential `IOException`, `InvocationTargetException`, and `SQLException` exceptions that might arise during the execution of the `doExchange()` method. 

While the code is functional, it lacks specificity in its exception handling. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Handle exceptions more granularly:**  Instead of catching all three exception types broadly, consider catching them individually. This allows for more tailored error handling and logging specific to each type of exception.

* **Provide descriptive error messages:** The current error messages ("doExchange failed") could be more informative. Include details about the nature of the error or the specific operation that failed. 

* **Consider re-throwing exceptions:**  In some cases, it might be appropriate to re-throw the exception after logging it. This allows the exception to propagate up the call stack, giving higher-level code the opportunity to handle it more effectively.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
try {
  doExchange();
} catch (IOException e) {
  logger.error("doExchange failed", e);
} catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
  logger.error("doExchange failed", e);
} catch (SQLException e) {
  logger.error("doExchange failed", e);
}
```
