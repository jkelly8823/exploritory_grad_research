VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the line `array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];`. This line performs array indexing using the result of `**trusted_ptr * 4096`. If `trusted_ptr` points to a value that is out of bounds, the expression `**trusted_ptr * 4096` could result in an index that exceeds the bounds of the `array`. This leads to writing data beyond the intended memory location, causing a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation:** Validate the value of `trusted_ptr` before using it in the calculations. Ensure that it points to a valid memory location within the bounds of the array.

2. ** bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking to prevent writing beyond the allocated memory of the `array`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
void call_victim(size_t untrusted_arg) {
      
      *arg_copy = untrusted_arg;
      array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];
      
    }
``` 

**Key Points:**

* **Out-of-Bounds Access:** The core issue is the potential for accessing memory outside the allocated space for the `array`.
* **Arbitrary Write:** An attacker could manipulate `trusted_ptr` to cause a buffer overflow, potentially overwriting critical data or executing malicious code.
