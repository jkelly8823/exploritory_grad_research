VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to direct use of user input in the `mask` variable. 
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a form with validation rules that include a "mask" field for the state and zipcode.  The `mask` values are defined using regular expressions, which are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if user-supplied data is directly used within these expressions.  An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `var-value` attribute, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in a user's browser.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:**  Before using user input in the `mask` variable, thoroughly sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or scripts.  Use a dedicated library or function for input sanitization. 
* **Avoid Direct Embedding of User Data:** Do not directly embed user input into regular expressions. Instead, use parameterized queries or template engines that separate user data from the core logic, effectively mitigating the risk of XSS.
* **Use a Robust Input Validation Library:**  Leverage a well-established input validation library that provides specific protections against various types of attacks, including XSS.
