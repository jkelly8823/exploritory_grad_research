VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Exposure of sensitive data (StorageAccountName) in configuration. 
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet directly includes the variable "{StorageAccountName}" within the configuration. This indicates  that the storage account name is being exposed directly in the code, which could lead to security risks. An attacker with access to this code could potentially infer sensitive information about the system's storage configuration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data such as storage account names in environment variables. This way, the actual value is not hardcoded in the code, reducing the risk of exposure. 
2. **Consider Secure Configuration Management:**  Implement a secure configuration management system that handles sensitive data securely. This can involve using encrypted key vaults or secrets management services.
3. **Sanitization:** If the "{StorageAccountName}" value must be displayed within the code for debugging or logging purposes, sanitize the output to remove potentially sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```json
{
"name": "{StorageAccountName}",
"enableHttpsTrafficOnly": true,
"type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
}
```
