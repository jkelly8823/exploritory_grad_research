VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Sensitive Information Disclosure
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses a string placeholder "{StorageAccountName}" which likely represents a real storage account name.  Leaving sensitive information like this directly in the code is a security risk. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Use Environment Variables:** Store secrets like the storage account name in environment variables and access them securely within your application.
* **Configuration Files:** If environment variables aren't suitable, use a dedicated configuration file (like .env or a JSON file) and keep it out of version control.
* **Parameterization:**  If this code is part of a larger system, consider passing the storage account name as a parameter instead of hardcoding it.

ORIGINAL CODE:

		     "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
		   
		   }
