VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1 (though the risk depends on context)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Exposure of Sensitive Information

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be using the Azure CLI to fetch information about a storage account.  The command `az storage account show` is designed to retrieve detailed information about an Azure Storage account.

The risk arises from the use of placeholder variables `{ResourceGroupName}` and `{StorageAccountName}`. If these variables are not properly managed and sanitized, they could expose sensitive information such as:

* **Resource Group Name:** Provides context about the Azure environment and potentially hints at other resources within that group.
* **Storage Account Name:** Directly identifies the target storage account, which could be used for malicious purposes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Parameterize Securely:**  Instead of using directly embedded placeholders, use secure methods for passing these values, such as:
   * **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables and access them within your script.
   * **Configuration Files:**  Use a configuration file (e.g., .ini, .json) to store parameters and load them into your code. Ensure the configuration file is protected appropriately.
   * **Azure Secret Manager:** For secrets within an Azure environment, leverage Azure Secret Manager to securely store and retrieve sensitive values.

2. **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that the values passed to the command are valid and expected.

3. **Least Privilege:**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege by only granting the necessary permissions to the account executing this code.  



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  az storage account show -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName}



               
	       
```
