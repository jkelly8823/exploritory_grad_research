VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for signal glitches in output 'z' due to simultaneous switching of `and_out1` and `and_out2`.
EXPLANATION:
The issue lies in the assignment of output 'z' which directly combines `and_out1` and `and_out2` using the logical OR operator (`|`).  When `sel` transitions, both `and_out1` and `and_out2` may attempt to change values simultaneously. This can lead to a brief period where both signals are in a transitional state, resulting in a temporary glitch or anomaly in the output 'z'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this potential glitch, consider using a more robust logic design technique. Here are a few options:

* **Transparent Latch:** Introduce a transparent latch between `and_out1` and `and_out2` driven by a separate control signal (e.g., a clock). This will ensure that only one signal updates at a time, preventing simultaneous switching.

* **Buffering:** Add buffers to the output lines of `and_out1` and `and_out2`. Buffers can help to stabilize the signals and prevent glitches from propagating through the circuit.
* **Edge-Triggered Logic:** If the input signals are time-sensitive, consider using edge-triggered logic elements (like D flip-flops) that sample and update their output on the rising or falling edge of a clock signal. This will ensure that only one signal updates per clock cycle.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```verilog
						// 2x1 Multiplexor using logic-gates
                        
						module glitchEx(
						
							input wire in0, in1, sel,
							output wire z
						
						);
                        
						wire not_sel;
						wire and_out1, and_out2;
						
						assign not_sel = ~sel;
						assign and_out1 = not_sel & in0;
						assign and_out2 = sel & in1;
                        
						// Buggy line of code:
						assign z = and_out1 | and_out2; // glitch in signal z
						
						endmodule
					
					endmodule
