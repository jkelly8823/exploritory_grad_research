VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Bitwise AND Operation 
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses bitwise AND operation (&) instead of bitwise OR operation (|) to combine the `BIT_READ` and `BIT_WRITE` flags.  This results in a mask of 0,  failing to accurately check for both read and write access. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace the `&` operator with the `|` operator in the line: `unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE;`


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #define BIT_READ 0x0001 // 00000001#define BIT_WRITE 0x0010 // 00010000unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE; /* intended to use "|" */// using "&", mask = 00000000// using "|", mask = 00010001// determine if user has read and write accessint hasReadWriteAccess(unsigned int userMask) { // if the userMask has read and write bits set// then return 1 (true)if (userMask & mask) {return 1;} // otherwise return 0 (false)return 0; }
