VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  
EXPLANATION:

The code is vulnerable to a security flaw called an SQL Injection.

 RECOMMENDATIONS: 
    
    * Never directly use user input in SQL queries.  Instead, use parameterized queries or a database abstraction layer to protect against malicious SQL code injection.
    * Sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters before using it in any part of your application, particularly in string comparisons or interpolations. 
*  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to the expected data types (in this case, integers). 

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  
                  def main():
                     
                     sum = 0
                     numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ").split(" ")
                     try:
                        
                        for num in numbers:
                           
                           sum = sum + int(num)
                           
                        print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
                        
                     except ValueError:
                        
                        print("Error: invalid input")
                        
                     
                  main()
