VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Session ID Length

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet sets a fixed session ID length of 8 bytes using the `<property name="idLengthBytes" value="8">` tag within a  web application configuration.  This hardcoded value poses a security risk. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Dynamic Session ID Length:** Instead of a fixed length, use a randomly generated session ID length based on cryptographic best practices.
* **Use Secure Session Management:**  Implement secure session management techniques like using strong hashing algorithms, rotating session IDs regularly, and leveraging appropriate HTTP-only and secure cookies flags.
* **Follow Security Standards:** Adhere to industry security standards and guidelines, such as OWASP's recommendations for session management.
