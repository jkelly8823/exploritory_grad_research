VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION: 
The code declares an array `bar` of type `record_t` with a size defined by `MAX_SIZE`. It goes on to use this array but ultimately calls `free(bar)`. This is likely a mistake because `free()` should be used to deallocate memory allocated with `malloc()` or similar functions.  Arrays allocated on the stack (like this one) are automatically deallocated when the function `foo()` ends. Calling `free()` on a stack-allocated array  is unnecessary and could result in unpredictable behavior or even crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Remove the `free(bar)` call:**  Since `bar` is allocated on the stack, it will be automatically freed when the `foo()` function ends.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  void foo(){
                        record_t bar[MAX_SIZE];
                           
                           /* do something interesting with bar */
                           
                           ...free(bar);
                     }
               
               ```
