VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user-supplied data (`address`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft malicious input for the `address` parameter that alters the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data from the database.

Specifically, the line `emailAddress.setString(1, address);`  is where the vulnerability occurs. The attacker's input for `address` could contain SQL code that bypasses the intended WHERE clause or modifies the UPDATE statement.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use parameterized queries:** Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL query, use parameterized queries. This separates the data from the SQL command, preventing malicious code from being interpreted as part of the query.

   ```java
   String updateString = "UPDATE shippingInfo SET address=?  WHERE email='cwe@example.com'";
   PreparedStatement emailAddress = con.prepareStatement(updateString);
   emailAddress.setString(1, address); 
   ```
2. **Sanitize user input:**  Even when using parameterized queries, it's good practice to sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters. However, this is less effective against sophisticated SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String address = request.getParameter("address");address = address.trim();String updateString = "UPDATE shippingInfo SET address='?' WHERE email='cwe@example.com'";emailAddress = con.prepareStatement(updateString);emailAddress.setString(1, address);); 
```
