VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The way the `$profilePath` variable is constructed allows an attacker to manipulate the `$username` parameter and access files outside the intended `/users/cwe/profiles` directory.  

An attacker could provide a `user` input like `../../etc/passwd` in the `param("user")` call. This would result in `$profilePath` being constructed as `/users/cwe/profiles/../../etc/passwd`, allowing access to the sensitive `passwd` file.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before using the `$username` parameter in the file path, validate and sanitize it to prevent traversal attempts. This could involve:
   - Allowing only alphanumeric characters and underscores in the username.
   - Encoding special characters to prevent interpretation as directory separators.
   - Validating that the username falls within a predefined whitelist of allowed values.

2. **Use safe path construction methods:** Instead of directly concatenating strings, consider using safer methods for constructing file paths, such as parameterized queries or functions designed to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles";
my $username = param("user");
my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");
print "<ul>\n";
while (<$fh>) {
  print "<li>$_</li>\n";
}
print "</ul>\n";
```
