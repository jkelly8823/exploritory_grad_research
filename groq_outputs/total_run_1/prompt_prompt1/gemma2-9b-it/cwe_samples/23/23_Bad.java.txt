VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 23-31
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 

The vulnerability lies in the handling of user-supplied data within the `filename` extraction and the subsequent file writing.  Specifically, the line `String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));` relies on user input from `pLine` to determine the filename.

Without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the filename, which would be executed when the file is later written to the disk and potentially accessed by other users. This allows for numerous attacks, including stealing sensitive information, redirecting users to malicious websites, or taking control of their session.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Always sanitize user input before using it in dynamic parts of your application.  Validate and escape any characters that could potentially be interpreted as code. 

2. **Use a Secure File Naming Convention:** Avoid relying on user-supplied data for filenames. Instead, use a secure naming convention that incorporates unique identifiers or timestamps.

3. **Escape File Output:** When rendering HTML pages or displaying file content, escape any user-supplied data to prevent XSS attacks. Libraries like Spring's `WebMarkupContainer` offer helpful utilities for this.
