VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
While this code snippet doesn't explicitly show a vulnerability, it has the potential for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack if the `filename` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used. 

An attacker could upload a file with a malicious JavaScript payload in the filename. If the server directly includes this filename in the HTML response, a user visiting that page could unintentionally execute the attacker's script.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Sanitize all user-supplied input**: Before using the `filename` in any part of the output, sanitize it rigorously to remove any potentially harmful characters or code. This might involve escaping HTML special characters, encoding the data, or using a dedicated input validation library.
- **Never directly embed user data**: Avoid directly embedding user-provided data, like filenames, into HTML elements. Instead, use safe methods to display the data, such as escaping it or using template engines that handle this automatically.
- **Validate file types**: Implement strict validation to ensure only allowed file types are uploaded. This can help mitigate some XSS risks.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```html
                  <form action="FileUploadServlet" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
                     Choose a file to upload:<input type="file" name="filename"/><br/><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"/>
                     </form>
               
               
```
