VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: A method signature error exists where the method return type is declared as void but also includes boolean.
EXPLANATION:
The `accessGranted` method is declared with conflicting return types. The first declaration sets it as `public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user)`, unintentionally combining the `void` (no return value) and `boolean` (returns a true/false value) types. This creates a syntax error.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:


* **Choose a consistent return type:**
   - **if the method should return a boolean value:**  Remove `void` from the declaration and leave it as `public boolean accessGranted(String resource, String user)`. 


ORIGINAL CODE:


```
                  private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...;public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user) {String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user);return accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES);}
                     private boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
                        
                           
                           // grant or deny access based on user roles
                           ...
                     }
               }
               
            
```
