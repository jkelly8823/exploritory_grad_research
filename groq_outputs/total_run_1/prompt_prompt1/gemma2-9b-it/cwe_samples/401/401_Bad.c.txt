VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The `read` function in the code does not bound-check the amount of data it reads. If the input stream `fd` provides more than `BLOCK_SIZE` bytes, the `read` function can write beyond the allocated memory for `buf`, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Limit data read:** Use `read` with a maximum length parameter to ensure it doesn't read past the allocated buffer size. 
* **Validate input:**  Always validate the length of data received from the input stream. 
* **Use safer alternatives:** Consider using libraries that handle reading data safely, such as those provided by OpenSSL.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  char* getBlock(int fd) {
                        char* buf = (char*) malloc(BLOCK_SIZE);if (!buf) {return NULL;}if (read(fd, buf, BLOCK_SIZE) != BLOCK_SIZE) {
                              
                                 return NULL;
                           }return buf;
                     }
               
            ```
