VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite loop vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 

The `while True:` loop creates an infinite loop. This means the program will continue to run indefinitely, consuming resources and potentially impacting system performance.  

Additionally, there are potential issues with the way the `parseUDPpacket` and `resolveName` functions are used without error handling. This could lead to unexpected program behavior or crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Implement a loop termination condition:**  Replace `while True:` with a condition that allows the loop to exit under specific circumstances. For example, you could check for a specific command or signal to break out of the loop.

2. **Error handling:**  Add error handling mechanisms within the `parseUDPpacket` and `resolveName` functions. This will help prevent crashes and ensure the program can gracefully handle invalid inputs or unexpected situations.

3. **Resource management:** Consider using a `with` statement to manage the socket resource. This will ensure the socket is properly closed when the loop exits or an error occurs, preventing resource leaks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                  sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)sock.bind( (UDP_IP,UDP_PORT) )
                  while true:
                        data = sock.recvfrom(1024)
                        if not data:
                            break
                           (requestIP, nameToResolve) = parseUDPpacket(data)
                           record = resolveName(nameToResolve)
                           sendResponse(requestIP,record)                     
                  
                  
                  
               
               ```
