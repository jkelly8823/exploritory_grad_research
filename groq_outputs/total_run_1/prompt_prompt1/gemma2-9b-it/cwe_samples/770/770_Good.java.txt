VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to unbounded thread creation.
EXPLANATION:
The code creates a new thread for every incoming client connection using `ExecutorService pool.execute(t)`. However, there is no mechanism to limit the creation of threads if the number of client connections exceeds the `MAX_CONNECTIONS` limit. This could lead to a DoS attack where an attacker floods the server with connections, exhausting system resources (threads, memory, etc.) and potentially crashing the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Implement connection throttling:** Limit the rate at which new connections are accepted to prevent an attacker from overwhelming the server.
2. **Enforce thread pool limits:** Ensure that the thread pool size (`MAX_CONNECTIONS`) is enforced and that no more threads are created than the limit allows.
3. **Handle exceptions gracefully:** Implement robust exception handling to prevent crashes in case of connection issues or resource exhaustion.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public static final int SERVER_PORT = 4444;public static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10;...
                     public void acceptConnections() {
                     
                        try {ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(SERVER_PORT);int counter = 0;boolean hasConnections = true;while (hasConnections) {hasConnections = checkForMoreConnections();Socket client = serverSocket.accept();Thread t = new Thread(new ClientSocketThread(client));t.setName(client.getInetAddress().getHostName() + ":" + counter++);ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_CONNECTIONS);pool.execute(t);}serverSocket.close();
                           
                           } catch (IOException ex) {...}
                     }
               
            
```
