VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code utilizes a loop to continuously receive messages from the socket and write them to a file. However, there is no check for the maximum size of the received message before writing it to the `buffer`. If a message exceeds the `BUFFER_SIZE`, it can lead to a buffer overflow, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially causing a crash or security exploit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Validate Message Size:** Before writing the received message to the `buffer`, ensure its size is less than `BUFFER_SIZE`. If it exceeds the limit, handle it appropriately (e.g., truncate the message, return an error, or drop it).
2.  **Use Safe String Functions:** When working with strings received from the socket, utilize safe string functions that prevent buffer overflows, such as `strncpy()` instead of `strcpy()`. 
3.  **Input Sanitization:** Consider sanitizing the received messages from the socket to remove any potentially malicious or unexpected characters.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
```c
                  int writeDataFromSocketToFile(char *host, int port){
                        
                           char filename[FILENAME_SIZE];char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];int socket = openSocketConnection(host, port);
                           if (socket < 0) {printf("Unable to open socket connection");return(FAIL);}if (getNextMessage(socket, filename, FILENAME_SIZE) > 0) {
                              if (openFileToWrite(filename) > 0) {
                                    while (getNextMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0){if (!(writeToFile(buffer) > 0))break;
                                       }
                                 }closeFile();
                           }closeSocket(socket);
                     }
               
               ```
