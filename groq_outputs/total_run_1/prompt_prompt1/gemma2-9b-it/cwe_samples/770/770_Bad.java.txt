VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to unbounded thread creation.

EXPLANATION: 
The code continuously accepts client connections in an infinite loop (`while (hasConnections)`). If the server is unable to handle a high volume of connections, the loop will keep creating threads (`new Thread(new ClientSocketThread(client))`), leading to potentially excessive thread creation and exhausting system resources. This can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where the server becomes unresponsive to legitimate requests.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Limit connections:** Implement a mechanism to limit the number of simultaneous connections the server accepts.
2. **Connection Timeout:** Set a timeout for client connections to prevent threads from holding resources indefinitely.
3. **Connection Rate Limiting:** Implement a rate limiter to control the number of connections from a single source within a specific time frame.
4. **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, thread count) and gracefully handle resource constraints.



ORIGINAL CODE:


```java
                  public void acceptConnections() {
                     
                        try {ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(SERVER_PORT);int counter = 0;boolean hasConnections = true;while (hasConnections) {Socket client = serverSocket.accept();Thread t = new Thread(new ClientSocketThread(client));t.setName(client.getInetAddress().getHostName() + ":" + counter++);t.start();}serverSocket.close();
                           
                           } catch (IOException ex) {...}
                     }
               
               ```
