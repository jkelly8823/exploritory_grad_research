VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate form names
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains two `<form>` elements within the `<formset>` that share the same name "ProjectForm".  

In a form system, unique names are crucial for proper data submission and processing. Having duplicate form names will likely lead to unpredictable behavior, as the server won't be able to differentiate between the two forms and may only process data from one of them.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* Change the name attribute of one of the `<form>` elements to a unique identifier. For instance, you could use "ProjectForm2" or any other distinct name.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```
