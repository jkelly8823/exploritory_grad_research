VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet displays a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  The way the `url` string is parsed and used in the `if` statement could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the application. 

Specifically, the line:

```java
if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){
```

checks if the beginning of the URL matches "examplescheme:". However, this check doesn't account for potential malicious data after the "examplescheme:" prefix.  An attacker could craft a URL that includes harmful JavaScript code after "examplescheme:", and this code could potentially be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** The `url` string should be thoroughly sanitized before using any part of it in dynamic code generation (like JavaScript execution). This can involve:
    - Encoding special characters that could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
    - Using a library specifically designed for URL parsing and sanitization.
2. **Input Validation:** Implement stricter input validation to ensure that URLs only contain expected characters and formats. 
3. **Escape Output:** When displaying any user-supplied data, escape it to prevent the browser from interpreting it as potentially malicious code.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
@Override 
public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
   if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){
      if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){
         writeDataToView(view, UserData);
         return false;
      }else{
         return true;
      }
   }
}
```
