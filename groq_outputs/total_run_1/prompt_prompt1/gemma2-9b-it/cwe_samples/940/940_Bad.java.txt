VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unqualified BroadCastReceiver registration

EXPLANATION:  
The code registers a `BroadcastReceiver` (`MyReceiver`)  using an `IntentFilter` to listen for the "com.example.RemoveUser" action. However, it doesn't specify any constraints or permissions on who can send this broadcast. 

This creates a situation where any app on the device, even malicious ones, could send an intent with the specified action. This could lead to unintended consequences, such as unauthorized deletion of user data.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Limit Broadcast Visibility:**  Move the broadcast registration inside a specific service or activity that requires the functionality to handle the "com.example.RemoveUser" intent.
2. **Use Permission Checks:** Require a specific permission in the manifest to be granted for apps to send the "com.example.RemoveUser" broadcast. This restricts who can trigger the action, adding a layer of protection.  
3. **Scoped Permissions:** Consider using Scoped Storage to further control access to user data, even when a permission is granted.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
registerReceiver(receiver, filter);


public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
 @Override
 public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
  int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
  destroyUserData(userID); 
 }
}
```
