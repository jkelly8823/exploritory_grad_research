VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability where user-supplied data from the URL query (`[URL query]`) is directly used to construct a URL used for `writeDataToView`.  If an attacker maliciously crafts the URL query with JavaScript or other potentially harmful code, it could be executed within the webview context when `writeDataToView` is called.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization before using  `[URL query]` in any URL construction.  Escape any special characters that could be interpreted as code within the context of the webview.
2. **Consider a Safe URL Scheme:** If possible, use a custom URL scheme specifically for communication between your app and the webview. This can help mitigate some XSS risks.
3. **Use a Secure Method for Data Transfer:** Instead of directly modifying the webview's content through `writeDataToView`, explore safer mechanisms for data exchange, such as JavaScript bridges or websockets.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                     // iOS
                     -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
                        NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
                              NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                                    
                                       
                                       // Make data available back in webview.
                                       UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
                                 }return NO;
                           }return YES;
                     }
