VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential `Divide by Zero` vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The function `divide` does not handle the case where the divisor (`y`) is zero. Dividing by zero is a mathematical undefined operation and will cause a runtime error in most programming languages.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Add a check to ensure that the divisor is not zero before performing the division. You could either:

*  Throw an exception: 
   ```c++
   double divide(double x, double y){
       if (y == 0) {
           throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero error");
       }
       return x / y;
   }
   ```
*  Return a specific value, such as `0` or `INFINITY`, to indicate an error: 
   ```c++
   double divide(double x, double y){
       if (y == 0) {
           return 0; // Or return some other suitable value
       }
       return x / y;
   }
   ``` 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
double divide(double x, double y){return x/y;}
```
