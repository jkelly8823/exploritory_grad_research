VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Division by Zero Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code defines a method `computeAverageResponseTime` that calculates the average response time by dividing the total time by the number of requests.  There's a risk of a `java.lang.ArithmeticException` (specifically, an `ArithmeticException` caused by integer division by zero) if `numRequests` is zero. 

In integer division, dividing by zero is not allowed and will result in an exception. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Add a check for zero requests:** Before performing the division, include a check to see if `numRequests` is zero. If it is, handle the case appropriately, such as:

   * Returning 0 as a sentinel value to indicate no average can be calculated.
   * Throwing a custom exception to signal an invalid input.

   ```java
   public int computeAverageResponseTime(int totalTime, int numRequests) {
       if (numRequests == 0) {
           // Handle the case where numRequests is zero
           return 0; // Or throw an exception 
       }
       return totalTime / numRequests;
   }
   ```



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests) {return totalTime / numRequests;}
;}
               
               ```
