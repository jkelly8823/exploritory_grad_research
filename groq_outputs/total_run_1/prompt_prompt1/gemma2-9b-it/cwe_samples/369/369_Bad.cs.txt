VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer division vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code performs integer division, which discards the remainder of the division. This can lead to unexpected results and potential vulnerabilities if the divisor (y) is zero.  

When dividing by zero, the program will likely result in a crash or undefined behavior. This is a serious issue as it can cause program crashes and security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
*   Add a check to ensure that the divisor is not zero before performing the division.



   ```c++
   int Division(int x, int y){
       if (y == 0) {
           // Handle the case where y is zero
           return 0; // Or throw an exception, return -1, etc.
       } else {
           return (x / y);
       }
   }
   ``` 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
                  int Division(int x, int y){return (x / y);}
               
               ```
