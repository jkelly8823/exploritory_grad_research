VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Assignment instead of comparison in the `if` statement.  
EXPLANATION:
 The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))` uses the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the comparison operator (`==`). This means the code is attempting to assign the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the variable `cert` rather than checking if `cert` is equal to the result.  This will always evaluate to true, bypassing the intended conditional logic. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line to: `if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) { `

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
                        
                           
                           // got certificate, host can be trusted
                           
                           
                           //foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
                           
                           
                           //if (X509_V_OK==foo) ...
                           
                        
                     }
               
               ```
