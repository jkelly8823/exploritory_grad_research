VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  NA 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code snippet exposes database credentials ("scott" and "tiger") directly in the code. This is a severe security vulnerability as it allows anyone with access to the code to directly access the database. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Store credentials securely:**  Use environment variables, a secure configuration file, or a dedicated secrets management system to store database credentials. Never hardcode them directly into your code.
 
* **Use parameterized queries:**  Instead of directly embedding user input (or credentials) into SQL queries, use parameterized queries. This prevents SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
...DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");......
