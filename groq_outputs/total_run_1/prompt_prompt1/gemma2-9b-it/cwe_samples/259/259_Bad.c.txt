VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5,
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: **Hardcoded Password** 
The code uses a literal string "Mew!" as the administrator password. This is a severe vulnerability as the password is directly embedded in the code and easily discoverable. 

EXPLANATION: 
A hardcoded password poses a significant security risk. Anyone with access to the source code can immediately determine the administrator password. This allows for unauthorized access to the system and potential exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- **Store the password securely:**  Instead of hardcoding the password, use a secure method to store it. This could involve:
    - Encrypting the password and storing the encrypted value.
    - Utilizing a password management system.

- **Sanitize user input:** When prompting for a password, sanitize the input to prevent malicious characters or attempts at manipulating the code.

-  **Employ a hashing algorithm:** Hash the entered password using a strong cryptographic hash function (like bcrypt or Argon2) and compare the hash against a stored hash. This prevents the actual password from being stored in plain text.



ORIGINAL CODE:   
                  int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
                        if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
                              
                                 printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
                           }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
                     }
