VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Password 
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores the password "Mew!" as a comparison string. This is highly insecure as any attacker who views the code will immediately know the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Store passwords securely:**  Never store passwords directly in your code.  Use a robust password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to securely store passwords. 
* **Use a salt:** Always apply a unique salt to each password hash to make it even harder to crack.
* **Implement strong authentication mechanisms:** Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security. 


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}
               
               ```
