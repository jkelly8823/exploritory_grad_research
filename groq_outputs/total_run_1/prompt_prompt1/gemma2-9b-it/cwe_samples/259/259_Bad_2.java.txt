VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION:  
The provided code snippet reveals plain-text storage of sensitive LDAP credentials (username and password) within a resource bundle file. This is highly problematic as it exposes these credentials directly in the source code, making them easily accessible to attackers.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never store sensitive credentials directly in code or configuration files.**
* **Implement robust secrets management:** Utilize dedicated secret management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve credentials. 
* **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables and access them during runtime. This provides better isolation and control.
* **Encrypt sensitive data:** Encrypt the resource bundle file itself to prevent attackers from reading the credentials even if they gain access to it.
