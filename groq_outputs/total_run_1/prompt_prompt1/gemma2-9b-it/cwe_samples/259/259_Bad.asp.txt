VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet exposes database credentials (username 'db2admin' and password 'password') directly within the connection string. This is a severe vulnerability as it allows anyone with access to the code to immediately learn the credentials and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Store Credentials Securely:**  Database credentials should never be hardcoded into the application. Use environment variables, a secure configuration file (encrypted), or a dedicated secrets management system to store these values.
2. **Parameterization:** If you must use a connection string, consider parameterizing it. This involves using placeholders in the connection string and passing the credentials in securely at runtime.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
