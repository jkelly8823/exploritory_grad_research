VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential memory leak.  

The line `char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);` dynamically allocates memory of size `SIZE` and stores the pointer to this memory in the `ptr` variable.

There's a conditional check `if (abrt)` which might free the allocated memory using `free(ptr);`. However,  the subsequent line `free(ptr);`  outside the conditional block will always free the memory regardless of the value of `abrt`. This can lead to a memory leak if `abrt` is  set to `true` because the memory allocated at the beginning will be freed twice. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this potential memory leak, remove the redundant `free(ptr);` statement outside the `if` block:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr); 
}
```

In this corrected version, the memory will only be freed if `abrt` is true, ensuring that it's not deallocated unnecessarily.  Make sure `abrt` is appropriately set based on your application's logic to avoid accidental memory deallocation.
