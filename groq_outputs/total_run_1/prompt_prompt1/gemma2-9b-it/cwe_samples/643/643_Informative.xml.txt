VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Lines 1-6 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Sensitive data (passwords) is stored in plain text.

EXPLANATION:  The provided code snippet stores usernames and passwords in clear text within an XML structure. This is a major security vulnerability because attackers who gain access to this data can easily read the passwords, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Hash Passwords:**  Instead of storing passwords directly, hash them using a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or Argon2. 
   * This makes it significantly harder for attackers to decipher the passwords even if the data is compromised.
* **Salted Hashing:** Combine each password hash with a unique "salt" value. This adds an extra layer of security because attackers cannot use pre-computed tables to crack the hashes.
* **Secure Data Storage:**

Store sensitive data in a secure location, such as an encrypted database, and minimize the amount of data exposed to application code.
