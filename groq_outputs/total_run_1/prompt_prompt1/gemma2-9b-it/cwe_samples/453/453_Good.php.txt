VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']`) into the `login_user` function without any sanitization or validation.  This makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input that alters the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data from the database. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before using the `$user` and `$pass` values in the `login_user` function, sanitize them to remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters that could be used for SQL injection. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to protect against this vulnerability.
2. **Validate input:** Implement input validation to ensure that the `$user` and `$pass` values meet expected formats and constraints. This can help prevent unexpected or malicious input from reaching the database.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;} 
```
