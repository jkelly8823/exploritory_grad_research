VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet appears safe. It uses a ternary operator to assign a value to the variable `addr_auth` based on the comparison of `address` with two specific hexadecimal values.  

There are no immediately obvious vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, buffer overflows, or hardcoded credentials.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
It's good practice to ensure that the `address` variable is appropriately sanitized and validated to prevent unexpected input that could lead to unintended behavior.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00 || address == 32'h800F00) ? 1: 0;
