VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. It allocates memory for `num_imgs`, which is determined by the function `get_num_imgs()`. If the `get_num_imgs()` function returns a value larger than the expected maximum number of image structures, the memory allocation using `malloc()` will result in insufficient memory being allocated. 

This can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, overwriting adjacent data and potentially causing program crashes or allowing attackers to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate `num_imgs`:** Before allocating memory, verify that the value returned by `get_num_imgs()` is within a safe range. Implement bounds checking to prevent allocation of excessive memory.
2. **Use Bounds-Safe Memory Allocation Functions:** Consider using memory allocation functions that provide bounds checking, such as  `calloc()` or safer alternatives from libraries like saferc

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
... 
```
