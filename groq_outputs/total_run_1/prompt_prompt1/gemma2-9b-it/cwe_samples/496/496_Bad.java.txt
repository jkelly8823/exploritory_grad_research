VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Sensitive Data Exposure
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability where user roles (likely containing sensitive information) are directly assigned to a publicly accessible field (`userRoles`). This means an attacker could potentially access and expose this sensitive data. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Encapsulation:**  Make the `userRoles` field private and provide controlled access through getter and setter methods.

*   **Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the `setUserRoles` method to ensure that only allowed values are assigned. This can help mitigate the risk of attackers injecting malicious roles.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
 private String[] userRoles;public void setUserRoles(String[] userRoles) {this.userRoles = userRoles;}  
``` 


**Important Notes:**

*   Without further context, it is impossible to definitively say if this code represents a serious risk. However, the potential for sensitive data exposure is evident. It's crucial to address this concern depending on the specific context of the application.
*   Security best practices often advocate for restricting access to sensitive data as much as possible.
