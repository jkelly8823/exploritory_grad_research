VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Code Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the `action` and `key` url parameters. The `handleConfigAction` function dynamically builds a string that includes the value of these parameters and executes it using `eval()`. This opens the door for an attacker to inject malicious code into the `$code` string, which will then be executed by the `eval()` function.

For example, an attacker could send a request with `action=delete_key` and `key=rm -rf /`. This would result in the execution of the command `rm -rf /`, which would delete all files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using `eval()` to execute user-supplied input.  
- Sanitize user input thoroughly before using it in any dynamic code.   
- Consider using a safer alternative to `eval()`, such as a library designed for dynamic code execution that includes built-in security measures.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
                  use CGI qw(:standard);
                     sub config_file_add_key {

                           # code to add a field/key to a file goes here
                           
                        
                     }
                     sub config_file_set_key {
                        my ($fname, $key, $arg) = @_;
                           
                           # code to set key to a particular file goes here
                           
                        
                     }
