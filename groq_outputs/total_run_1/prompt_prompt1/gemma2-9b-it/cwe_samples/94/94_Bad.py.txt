Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `eval()` function is highly susceptible to injection attacks. When used with untrusted input (like the `input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ")` in this case), an attacker can craft malicious code that will be executed by the program.

This means that instead of just adding numbers, an attacker could potentially:

* Modify the program's behavior
* Access sensitive system information
* Delete or modify files
* Take control of the system entirely.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Never use `eval()` with user-supplied input.**  There are safer alternatives for parsing user input, depending on the expected format. 

    * For space-separated numbers, consider using the `split()` method and then converting each element to an integer using `int()`. Here's an example:
    ```python
    numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ").split()
    numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
    ```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                
                  def main():
                  
                    sum = 0
                    numbers = eval(input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: "))
                    for num in numbers:
                    
                      sum = sum + num
                    
                    print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
                  
                  main()
