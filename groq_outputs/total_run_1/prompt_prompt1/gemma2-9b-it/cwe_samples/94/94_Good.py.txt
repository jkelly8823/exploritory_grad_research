VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a TypeError during output
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to print the `numbers` list within the `print` statement inside the `try` block. However,  the f-string formatting expects a string, and directly inserting the `numbers` list (which is a list of strings) could result in a TypeError if the  values within the list are not string-compatible during  the concatenation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Iterate and format:** 
   -  Loop through the `numbers` list and join each element with a space within the f-string. `print(f"Sum of { ' '.join(numbers)} = {sum}")`

   *   This ensures that all elements in the list are properly formatted as strings before being concatenated.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  
                  def main():
                  
                    sum = 0
                    numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ").split(" ")
                    try:
                    
                      for num in numbers:
                      
                        sum = sum + int(num)
                      
                      print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
                    
                    except ValueError:
                    
                      print("Error: invalid input")
                    
                  
                  main()
