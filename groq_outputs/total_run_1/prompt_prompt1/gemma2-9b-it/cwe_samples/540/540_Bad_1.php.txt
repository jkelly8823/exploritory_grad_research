VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive Information Exposure
EXPLANATION: 

The provided code snippet directly embeds database credentials (`$dbName` and `$dbPassword`) within the PHP file. This is a severe security vulnerability as it exposes these sensitive values to anyone with access to the source code.  An attacker could easily extract these credentials and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Do not hardcode credentials:**  Never store database credentials directly in your code. This is a fundamental security best practice. 
2. **Use environment variables:** Store your database credentials in environment variables. These variables are not visible in the code itself, making them less accessible to attackers. 

3. **Configuration files:** If you need to store sensitive information, use a separate configuration file (`config.php`, for example) that is not tracked in version control.

4. **Secure storage:**  For even greater security, consider using a dedicated secrets management system to store and manage your sensitive data.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
include('database.inc');
$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);
$db->authenticateUser($username, $password);
?>
```
