VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded credentials 
EXPLANATION:  The database name and password are stored directly in the source code. This makes them easily accessible to anyone who has access to the code, creating a significant security risk.  
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Store credentials securely:**  Do not hardcode credentials in your code. Use environment variables, a secrets management system, or a configuration file to store sensitive information.
* **Use strong passwords:**  The provided password, while seemingly random, is short. Adhere to strong password guidelines with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php

$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
