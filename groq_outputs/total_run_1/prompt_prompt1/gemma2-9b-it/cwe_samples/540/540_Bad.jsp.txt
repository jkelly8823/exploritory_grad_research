VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The comment "<!-- FIXME: calling this with more than 30 args kills the JDBC server -->" suggests that the code is designed to handle a limited number of arguments when interacting with a JDBC database.  This can be a sign of potential SQL injection vulnerability if user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.  

Attackers could craft malicious input containing special SQL characters to manipulate the database. For example, if the code is not correctly prepared for many arguments, an attacker might try to inject commands into the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Parameterize SQL Queries:** 
Use parameterized queries with placeholders (e.g., '?') to insert values from user input. The database driver will then escape these values appropriately, preventing malicious SQL code from being executed.

2. **Validate and Sanitize User Input:** 
Before using user input in SQL queries, thoroughly validate and sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters.  

3. **Limit Input Lengths:** Implement maximum length restrictions on user inputs to minimize the risk of buffer overflows or excessive argument counts that could lead to errors.
