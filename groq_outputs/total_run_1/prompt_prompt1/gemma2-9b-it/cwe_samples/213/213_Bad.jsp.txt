VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct Output of Sensitive Information 

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a direct output of potentially sensitive data (Social Security Number and Credit Card Number) via string interpolation using `<%= %>`.  This means that any values stored in the `ssn` and `ccn` variables will be directly embedded into the HTML output. 

If these variables contain actual user data, this practice poses a severe security risk. A malicious actor could potentially access this information through network inspection or by manipulating the web server. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize Output:** Never directly output sensitive data like SSN or Credit Card Numbers. Implement proper sanitization techniques to remove or obfuscate potentially harmful characters before displaying the data.

* **Use Parameterized Queries:** If the data is being generated dynamically, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
* **Data Storage Security:** Ensure that the `ssn` and `ccn` variables are stored securely with appropriate access controls and encryption.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  Social Security Number: <%= ssn %></br>Credit Card Number: <%= ccn %>
