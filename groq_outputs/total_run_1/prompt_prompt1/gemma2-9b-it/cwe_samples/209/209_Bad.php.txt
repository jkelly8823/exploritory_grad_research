VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Error Disclosure 
EXPLANATION: The code catches all exceptions using a generic `Exception` clause. While handling exceptions is good practice, echoing the exception message and the configuration file location directly can disclose sensitive information about the application's infrastructure. An attacker could exploit this to potentially learn about database credentials, file paths, or other sensitive configurations. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 

1. **Log Exceptions Instead of Displaying Them:** Instead of echoing the exception details to the user, log them to a secure location. This separates sensitive information from user-facing outputs. 

   ```php
   try {
       openDbConnection();
   } catch (Exception $e) {
       // Log the exception details to a file or a dedicated logging system
       error_log("Exception: " . $e->getMessage() . " - " . $Mysql_config_location); 
   }
   ```

2. **Sanitize Configuration File Paths:** Avoid directly disclosing the full path to the configuration file. Consider using a more generic path or hiding the specific location.

3. **Handle Specific Exceptions:** If possible, catch and handle specific exception types separately. This allows for tailored error handling and prevents unnecessary disclosure of information. For example, catch `PDOException` specifically to handle database connection errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  try {openDbConnection();}
                     //print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
                     catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
               
```
