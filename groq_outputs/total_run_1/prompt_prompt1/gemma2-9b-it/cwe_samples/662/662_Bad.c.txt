EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet demonstrates correct usage of a mutual exclusion lock (`pthread_mutex_t`) to protect access to a shared resource.  

Here's why it's safe:

* **Locking:** The code acquires the lock (`pthread_mutex_lock(mutex)`) before accessing the shared resource, ensuring that only one thread can hold the lock at a time.
* **Unlocking:**  The lock is correctly released (`pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)`) after the shared resource access is complete. This allows other threads to acquire the lock and access the resource.
* **Resource Access:** The comment `/* access shared resource */` indicates the critical section where the shared resource is modified, emphasizing the need for the locking mechanism.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No immediate changes are needed.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
                        pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
                           
                           /* access shared resource */
                           
                           
                           pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
                     }
