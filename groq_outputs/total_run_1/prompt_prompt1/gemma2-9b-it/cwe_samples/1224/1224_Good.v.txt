VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
In line 8, the code performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between `Data_in` and `16'hFFFE`. If `Data_in` has a value that, when ANDed with `16'hFFFE` results in a value larger than 16 bits, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-  **Input Validation:**  Implement checks on the `Data_in` value to ensure it is within the expected range before performing the bitwise AND operation. This can involve comparing `Data_in` against known valid values or using saturation arithmetic to clamp the result within the desired bounds.
- **Consider Data Type:** If the `Data_in`  is known to potentially exceed 16 bits, consider using a larger data type (e.g., 32-bit) to prevent overflow.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
module register_write_once_example 
  ( 
  input [15:0] Data_in, 
  input Clk, 
  input ip_resetn, 
  input global_resetn, 
  input write, 
  output reg [15:0] Data_out 
  ); 
  
  reg Write_once_status; 
  
  always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip_resetn) 
  
    if (~ip_resetn) 
    begin 
      
      Data_out <= 16'h0000; 
      Write_once_status <= 1'b0; 
      
    end 
    else if (write & ~Write_once_status) 
    begin 
      
      Data_out <= Data_in & 16'hFFFE; // Vulnerability: Potential Integer Overflow
      Write_once_status <= 1'b1; // Write once status set on first write, independent of input 
      
    end 
    else if (~write) 
    begin 
      
      Data_out[15:1] <= Data_out[15:1]; 
      Data_out[0] <= Write_once_status; 
      
    end 
  
  
  endmodule
  endmodule
