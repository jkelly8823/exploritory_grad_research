VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Missing exception handling for Socket creation and PrintWriter initialization.
EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to create a `Socket` and a `PrintWriter` within a `try` block. However, it lacks a corresponding `catch` block to handle potential exceptions during these operations. If the connection to `REMOTE_HOST` and `REMOTE_PORT` fails, or if there's an issue writing to the socket output stream, an unchecked exception will be thrown, potentially crashing the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Handle Socket Exceptions:** Add a `catch` block to specifically handle `IOException` that might occur during socket creation.

   ```java
   try {
       sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Log the exception and handle it appropriately (e.g., retry, fail gracefully)
       System.err.println("Error connecting to socket: " + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

2. **Handle PrintWriter Exceptions:** Add a `catch` block to handle `IOException` that might occur during `PrintWriter` initialization.

   ```java
   try {
       out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Log the exception and handle it appropriately
       System.err.println("Error initializing PrintWriter: " + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

3. **Combine Exception Handling:** Combine both exception handling blocks for better code organization.

   ```java
   try {
       sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);
       out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Log the exception and handle it appropriately
       System.err.println("Error connecting or initializing PrintWriter: " + e.getMessage()); 
   } 



   ORIGINAL CODE:
   
   ```java
   Socket sock;PrintWriter out;
       try {
          sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);out = new PrintWriter(echoSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
              
              // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
              ...
       }
      
       
   ```
