VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Input Sanitization 
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to attacks due to the direct use of user-supplied input  (`$varname_name`) without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could craft malicious input, potentially leading to issues like file overwrite or remote code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* Implement robust input validation to ensure the `$varname_name` value adheres to expected formats and avoids dangerous characters.
* Use a whitelist approach to restrict allowed filenames, considering safe characters and common file extensions.
* Employ appropriate escaping techniques to prevent injection attacks if the filename will be used within dynamic code or queries.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
```
                  $varname = name of the temporary file on local machine$varname_size = size of file$varname_name = original name of file provided by client$varname_type = MIME type of the file  
```
