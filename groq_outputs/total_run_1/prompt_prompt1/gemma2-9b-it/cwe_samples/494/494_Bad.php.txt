VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$username` and `$password`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization. 

An attacker could craft malicious input that alters the intended query, allowing them to potentially:

* Retrieve sensitive data from the database
* Modify or delete existing data
*  Gain unauthorized access to the database

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use parameterized queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most secure approach.  Instead of directly embedding variables in the SQL query, you would use placeholders and provide the values separately. The database driver would then handle escaping and sanitizing the input.

   Here's an example using PHP and PDO (recommended over `mysql_*` functions):

   ```php
   $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password');
   $stmt->execute(['username' => $username, 'password' => $password]); 
   ```

2. **Escape user input:** If parameterized queries are not an option, you should carefully escape all user input before using it in SQL queries. This involves using functions provided by your database library to prevent special characters from being interpreted as SQL commands.

   **Important Note:**  `mysql_real_escape_string` is deprecated and insecure.

3. **Validate input:** Before using user input in queries, validate it to ensure it matches the expected format and length. This can help prevent unexpected behavior and reduce the risk of injection attacks.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
                  
                     //assume the password is already encrypted, avoiding CWE-312
                     
                     function authenticate($username,$password){
                        include("http://external.example.com/dbInfo.php");
                        
                        //dbInfo.php makes $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname available
                        mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');mysql_select_db($dbname);$query = 'Select * from users where username='.$username.' And password='.$password;$result = mysql_query($query);
                        if(mysql_numrows($result) == 1){mysql_close();return true;}else{mysql_close();return false;}
                     }
               }
               
               
```
