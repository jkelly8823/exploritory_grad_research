VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `strcpy(str, "Search Me!")` to copy a fixed-size string into a dynamically allocated buffer.  If `"Search Me!"`  is longer than the allocated buffer size (20 characters), a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities if attackers can control the input string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use `strncpy(str, "Search Me!", sizeof(str) - 1)` instead of `strcpy()`. This function limits the number of characters copied to the buffer, preventing buffer overflows. Remember to also null-terminate the string after copying.

2. Validate the length of the input string `"Search Me!"` before copying it. Ensure it doesn't exceed the allocated buffer size.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 #define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)
int contains_char(char c){
   char *str;
   str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
   strcpy(str, "Search Me!"); 
   while( *str != NULL){
     if( *str == c ){
       
       /* matched char, free string and return success */
       free(str);
       return SUCCESS;
     }
     /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
     
     str = str + 1;
   }
   /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
   
   free(str);
   return FAILURE;
 }
}
```
