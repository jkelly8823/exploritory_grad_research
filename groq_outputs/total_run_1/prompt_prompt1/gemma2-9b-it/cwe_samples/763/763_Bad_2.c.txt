VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code allocates a fixed-size buffer (`input`) of 40 characters using `malloc`. However, it then uses `gets_user_input` which doesn't perform any input validation or size checking. This means that if a user enters more than 40 characters, it will write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code, crash the program, or gain unauthorized access to system resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Limit input length:** Use a safer function like `fgets` to read user input, specifying the maximum number of characters to read (e.g., `fgets(input, 40, stdin)`).

2. **Validate input:**  Check the length of the input received and ensure it doesn't exceed the allocated buffer size. 
3. **Use bounds checking:** Implement bounds checking within the `strtok` loop to prevent accessing memory outside the valid buffer range.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                   
                     //hardcode input length for simplicity
                     char* input = (char*) malloc(40*sizeof(char));char *tok;char* sep = " \t";
                     get_user_input( input );
                     
                     /* The following loop will parse and process each token in the input string */
                     
                     tok = strtok( input, sep);while( NULL != tok ){
                        if( isMalformed( tok ) ){
                              
                                 
                                 /* ignore and discard bad data */
                                 free( tok );
                           }else{add_to_command_queue( tok );}tok = strtok( NULL, sep));
                     }
