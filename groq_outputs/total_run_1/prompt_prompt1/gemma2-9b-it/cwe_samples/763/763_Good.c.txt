VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory Leak 
EXPLANATION: The code allocates memory for a string using `malloc` but does not properly handle memory deallocation when the desired character is not found. This leads to a memory leak. The line `free(str);return FAILURE;` would execute only if the character isn't found, freeing the memory. However, if the character is found,  the memory is freed within the `if` statement, and a return statement exits the function before `i` is incremented.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Ensure consistent memory deallocation:**  The `free(str);` statement should execute regardless of whether the character is found or not. Ideally, all memory allocated by `malloc` should be consistently deallocated when it's no longer needed.  Consider moving the `free(str)`  outside of the `if` statement and making it `return SUCCESS` instead of inside the `if` . 
2. **Early exit optimization:**  If memory must be freed upon a successful match, its logical to return from the function before incrementing `i` , , releasing the resource..



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #define SUCCESS (1)#define FAILURE (0)
                     int cointains_char(char c){
                        char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");while( i < strlen(str) ){
                              if( str[i] == c ){
                                    
                                       
                                       /* matched char, free string and return success */
                                       free(str);return SUCCESS;
                                 }
                                 /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
                                 
                                 i = i + 1;
                           }
                           /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
                           
                           free(str);return FAILURE;
                     }
