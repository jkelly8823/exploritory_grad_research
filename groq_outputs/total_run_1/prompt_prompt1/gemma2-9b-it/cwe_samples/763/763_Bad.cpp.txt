VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential memory leak.
EXPLANATION:
The code dynamically allocates memory for a `BarObj` using `new` but does not check if the allocation was successful. If `new` fails, the program will crash. Furthermore, the code does not indicate any usage of the allocated memory, suggesting a potential memory leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Check `new` return value:**  Add a check to ensure that the allocation was successful. If `new` returns `nullptr`, handle the error appropriately (e.g., log the error and exit the program).
2. **Use smart pointers:** Consider using smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) to manage the memory automatically. This eliminates the need for manual `new` and `free`.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  void foo(){
                        BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
                           /* do some work with ptr here */
                           
                           ...
                           free(ptr);
                     }
