EXPLANATION:  The code snippet demonstrates proper dynamic memory management.

* A pointer `ptr` to a `BarObj` object is dynamically allocated using `new`. 
* After the object is used, `delete ptr;` is called to deallocate the memory occupied by the `BarObj`.  This prevents memory leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: NA
ORIGINAL CODE:   
                  void foo(){
                        BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
                           /* do some work with ptr here */
                           
                           ...
                           delete ptr;
                     }  
        
Note: While the code itself is well-structured,  in a real-world scenario, it's essential to consider these points:

* **Error Handling:**  The code doesn't include error handling for the `new` operation in case it fails to allocate memory.  Adding a check for `ptr == nullptr` after the `new` statement is good practice.
* **Resource Ownership:**  Who is ultimately responsible for deleting `ptr`? In larger programs, it's important to establish clear ownership of dynamically allocated resources to avoid double-deletion or memory leaks.
