VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `update_profile` function directly inserts data from the `$_POST` array into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This leaves the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `$_POST['email']` field to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to modify or steal data from the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before using `$_POST['email']` in the SQL query, sanitize it thoroughly. This involves escaping special characters that could be misinterpreted as SQL code. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to further mitigate the risk.

   Here's an example using prepared statements:

   ```php
   function update_profile() {
       //sanitized input
       $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['email']); 
       $stmt = $conn->prepare("UPDATE users SET email=? WHERE username = ?");  
       $stmt->bind_param("ss", $email, $_SESSION['username']);  
       $stmt->execute(); 

       if ($stmt->affected_rows > 0) {
           echo "Your profile has been successfully updated.";
       } 
       $stmt->close();
  }
   ```

2. **Use a database abstraction layer:** Consider using a framework or library that provides a higher level of abstraction for interacting with databases. These tools often offer built-in mechanisms for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
                  // initiate the session in order to validate sessions
                     session_start();
                     
                     //if the session is registered to a valid user then allow update
                     
                     if (! session_is_registered("username")) {
                        
                           echo "invalid session detected!";
                           
                           // Redirect user to login page
                           [...]
                           exit;
                     }
                     
                     // The user session is valid, so process the request
                     
                     
                     // and update the information
                     
                     update_profile();
                     function update_profile {
                        
                           
                           // read in the data from $POST and send an update
                           
                           
                           // to the database
                           SendUpdateToDatabase($_SESSION['username'], $_POST['email']);[...]echo "Your profile has been successfully updated.";
                     }
               
               ```
