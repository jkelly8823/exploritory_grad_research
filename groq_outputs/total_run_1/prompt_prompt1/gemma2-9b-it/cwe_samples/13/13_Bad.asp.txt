VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers:  (lines containing `<add ...>` tag)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet exposes database credentials (username and password) directly within the connection string. This practice is highly insecure as it leaves sensitive information readily accessible to anyone who has access to the codebase. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables instead of embedding them directly in the code. This allows for more secure management and avoids exposing credentials in source code.
* **Configuration Files:** Utilize a separate configuration file to store sensitive data like database credentials. This file can be securely managed and kept outside of the main codebase.
* **Secret Management Tools:** Implement dedicated secret management tools for storing and retrieving sensitive information. These tools often employ encryption and access control mechanisms to enhance security.  
ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  ...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
