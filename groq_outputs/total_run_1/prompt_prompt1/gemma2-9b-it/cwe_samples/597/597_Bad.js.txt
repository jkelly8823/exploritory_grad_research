VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Type Coercion 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to type coercion in JavaScript.  

Specifically, the comparisons within the `if` statements involve numerical (`i`) and string (`s1`, `s4`) data types. 

In JavaScript, when comparing values of different types, type coercion can occur. This means the interpreter might implicitly convert one type to another to facilitate the comparison.  In this case, the `===` operator compares for strict equality (value and type).

* In line 6, `i === s1`, JavaScript will likely coerce the string '65' to a number before comparing.

* However, in lines 7 and 8, `s4 === i` and `s4 === s1`, `s4` is a String object.

This variability in type interactions could lead to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Explicit Type Conversion:** To ensure consistent comparison behavior, explicitly convert the data types before comparing.

    * Example for line 6:  `if (Number(s1) === i)`
    * Example for line 7: `if (String(s4) === i)`
2. **Clarity Through Type Annotation:** In modern JavaScript development, consider using type annotations (e.g., TypeScript) to explicitly define the types of variables (`i`, `s1`, `s4`) and enforce type safety. 

3. **Consider Your Logic:**

Assess whether the type coercion in your specific use case is intentional. If it's not, strive for explicit type conversions and avoid relying on unpredictable type behavior.


 ORIGINAL CODE: 



                  <p id="ieq3s1" type="text">(i === s1) is FALSE</p>
                  <p id="s4eq3i" type="text">(s4 === i) is FALSE</p>
                  <p id="s4eq3s1" type="text">(s4 === s1) is FALSE</p>
                  
                  var i = 65;
                  var s1 = '65';
                  var s4 = new String('65');
                  
                  if (i === s1)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("ieq3s1").innerHTML = "(i === s1) is TRUE";
                  }
                  
                  if (s4 === i)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("s4eq3i").innerHTML = "(s4 === i) is TRUE";
                  }
                  
                  if (s4 === s1)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("s4eq3s1").innerHTML = "(s4 === s1) is TRUE";
                  }
