VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: String Comparison

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses the `==` operator to compare two String objects. However, the `==` operator in Java checks for object identity, meaning it compares whether two references point to the same object in memory.  

String objects in Java are immutable. When you create two strings with the same content using `new String("Hello")`, they are created as separate objects residing in different memory locations. Therefore, `str1 == str2` will always evaluate to false.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Use the `.equals()` method to compare the content of the strings. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");
if (str1.equals(str2)) {
    System.out.println("str1 == str2");
} 
```


ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  String str1 = new String("Hello");String str2 = new String("Hello");if (str1 == str2) {System.out.println("str1 == str2");}
               
               }
               
               
               
               ```
