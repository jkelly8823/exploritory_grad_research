VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any readily apparent vulnerabilities. 

It performs a simple comparison between an integer variable `$i` and a string variable `$s1`.  The `===` operator checks for both value and type equality.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The code appears sound.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  var $i = 65;
                  var $s1 = "65";
                  
                  if ($i === $s1)
                  {
                  echo '($i === $s1) is TRUE'. "\n";
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  echo '($i === $s1) is FALSE'. "\n";
                  }
               
               }
