VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Type coercion vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:

The code performs type coercion when comparing `i` (an integer) with `s1` (a string) and `s4` (a String object). 

In JavaScript, the `==` operator performs type coercion. This means it attempts to convert the operands to a common type before comparison. In this case, when `i` (65) is compared with `s1` ('65'), the string `'65'` is coerced into the number 65, resulting in a successful comparison.

Similarly, when `s4` is compared with `i`, the `==` operator likely performs type coercion, leading to another potential vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use strict comparison (`===`)**: Replace the `==` operator with `===` to perform strict comparison without type coercion. This will ensure that the comparison is done based on both value and type.

    

Original Code:



```javascript
                  <p id="ieq2s1" type="text">(i == s1) is FALSE</p>
                  <p id="s4eq2i" type="text">(s4 == i) is FALSE</p>
                  <p id="s4eq2s1" type="text">(s4 == s1) is FALSE</p>
                  
                  var i = 65;
                  var s1 = '65';
                  var s4 = new String('65');
                  
                  if (i == s1)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("ieq2s1").innerHTML = "(i == s1) is TRUE";
                  }
                  
                  if (s4 == i)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("s4eq2i").innerHTML = "(s4 == i) is TRUE";
                  }
                  
                  if (s4 == s1)
                  {
                  document.getElementById("s4eq2s1").innerHTML = "(s4 == s1) is TRUE";
                  }
               
            ```
