VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any apparent vulnerabilities.  It compares an integer variable `$i` with its string representation `$s1`.  

The code correctly uses the equality operator (`==`) for comparison. While `$i` and `$s1` have the same value, this is an intended behavior in the given context.  There is no risk of type confusion or injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The code appears to be safe and functioning as intended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  var $i = 65;
                  var $s1 = "65";
                  
                  if ($i == $s1)
                  {
                  echo '($i == $s1) is TRUE'. "\n";
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  echo '($i == $s1) is FALSE'. "\n";
                  }
               
            }
               
            
               
            ```
