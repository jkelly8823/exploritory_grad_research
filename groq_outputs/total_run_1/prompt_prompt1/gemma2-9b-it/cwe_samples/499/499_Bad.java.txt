VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Information Exposure -  The `SocialSecurityNumber` field is mutable and directly accessible via the public constructor.
EXPLANATION:
The `PatientRecord` class has a `SocialSecurityNumber` field declared as `private`, which is a good starting point for security. However, the constructor allows direct assignment of the `socialSecurityNum` parameter to the private field, bypassing any potential access control. This means that once an object of this class is created with a social security number, that number can be directly accessed and potentially exposed.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Encapsulate the `socialSecurityNum` with a getter and setter:**
   - Provide a public getter method (`getSocialSecurityNumber()`) to retrieve the value, and a protected or private setter method (`setSocialSecurityNumber(String ssn)`) to modify the value. This allows controlled access and modification.

2. **Sanitize Input:** 
   - Implement robust validation within the setter method to ensure that the input `ssn` adheres to the correct format and length for a social security number. This helps prevent malicious or unexpected data from being stored.

3. **Minimize Data Retention:** 
   - If possible, consider storing social security numbers only when absolutely necessary and removing them from memory or storage as soon as they are no longer needed.  



ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
class PatientRecord {
 private String name;
 private String socialSecurityNum;
 public Patient(String name,String ssn) {
     this.SetName(name);
     this.SetSocialSecurityNumber(ssn);
 }
}
```
