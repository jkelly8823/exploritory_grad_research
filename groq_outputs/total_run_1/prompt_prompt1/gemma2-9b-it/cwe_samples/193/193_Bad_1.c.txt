VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because `strncat` doesn't guarantee the destination buffer (`fullname`) is large enough to accommodate the concatenated strings. If `firstname` or `lastname` are longer than 20 characters, the function will write past the allocated memory for `fullname`, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate input sizes:** Before concatenating, ensure that the lengths of `firstname` and `lastname` are within the bounds of `fullname` (40 characters). 
2. **Use safer alternatives:** Consider using `strncpy` to copy the strings while explicitly specifying the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing unexpected overruns. For example:
   ```c
   strncpy(fullname, firstname, sizeof(fullname) - 1);
   fullname[sizeof(fullname) - 1] = '\0'; 
   
   strncpy(fullname + strlen(fullname), lastname, sizeof(fullname) - strlen(fullname) - 1);
   fullname[sizeof(fullname) - 1] = '\0'; 
   ```
3. **Use string manipulation libraries:** Explore safer string manipulation libraries designed to prevent buffer overflows, such as `snprintf` for formatted string output.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char firstname[20];
char lastname[20];
char fullname[40];
fullname[0] = '\0';
strncat(fullname, firstname, 20);
strncat(fullname, lastname, 20);
```
