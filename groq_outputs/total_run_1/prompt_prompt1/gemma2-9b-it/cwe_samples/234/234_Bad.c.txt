VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing semicolon at the end of the function declaration.
EXPLANATION:
In C, every statement must end with a semicolon (;). Here, the function declaration `void foo_funct(int one, int two, int three)` is missing a semicolon at the end on the first line. This will lead to a compilation error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a semicolon at the end of the function declaration line:

```c
void foo_funct(int one, int two, int three) {
 printf("1) %d\n2) %d\n3) %d\n", one, two, three);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  foo_funct(one, two);
                     void foo_funct(int one, int two, int three) {printf("1) %d\n2) %d\n3) %d\n", one, two, three);});}
               
               ```
