VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The `Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");` line executes a system command directly. If the "make" argument is user-supplied or not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious commands into it. For example, they might provide a string like  "make -f /evil/Makefile" which could allow them to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never directly execute user-supplied commands:** Avoid using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` with untrusted input. 
* **Use a safer alternative:** If you need to run commands, consider using a safer approach like ProcessBuilder or a library specifically designed for executing commands securely. Always sanitize and validate user input thoroughly before using it in command-line arguments.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  ...System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");... 
               ...
