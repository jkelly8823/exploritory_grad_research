VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Missing error handling for the `c.Path, err = exec.LookPath(name)` line. 
EXPLANATION: 
The code executes `exec.LookPath(name)` to determine the path to the executable specified by `name`. However, if `exec.LookPath` fails to find the executable (i.e., `err` is not nil), the function ignores the error and proceeds. This could lead to issues if the executable is not found, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Check for errors:**  Add a check to ensure that the `err` returned by `exec.LookPath` is nil. If it's not nil, return the error explicitly.

* **Handle missing executables:** Consider implementing logic to handle cases where the executable is not found. You could log an error message, prompt the user for the correct path, or return a specific error indicating the missing executable.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```go
func ExecuteGitCommand(name string, arg []string) error {
    c := exec.Command(name, arg...)
    var err error
    c.Path, err = exec.LookPath(name)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
} 
```
