VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Poor Random Number Generation 
EXPLANATION:  

Using `System.currentTimeMillis()` as the seed for a `Random` object  can result in predictable random numbers. An attacker could potentially predict the generated random numbers if they know the system's timing or have access to past timestamps.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

-   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for security-sensitive applications.  Java provides `SecureRandom` for this purpose.
-   If you must use a `Random` object,  consider using a more robust seed source, such as:
    - A system entropy source (e.g., `SecureRandom`).
    - A combination of multiple random sources.
    - A hardware random number generator (HRNG) if available.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
int accountID = random.nextInt();
```
