VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential authorization bypass vulnerability via  `isOwnerOf` function
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly checks if the user owns a file using the `isOwnerOf` function. This function is not shown in the provided snippet. 

**Potential Issues:**

* **Incomplete or Insecure `isOwnerOf` Implementation:** The `isOwnerOf` function's logic is crucial for verifying file ownership. If it's not implemented correctly or contains vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially bypass the authorization check.  An attacker might be able to manipulate input to the function or exploit weaknesses in the function to gain access to files they shouldn't have permission to view.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Review and Strengthen `isOwnerOf`:**
   - Carefully examine the implementation of the `isOwnerOf` function. 
   - Ensure it uses robust methods for verifying file ownership, such as checking against a secure database of user permissions or utilizing a filesystem access control list (ACL).
2. **Input Sanitization:**  
   - Sanitize all user inputs (`$username`, `$filename`) to prevent injection attacks that might manipulate the `isOwnerOf` function's logic.
3. **Access Control Layer:** If possible, consider implementing a higher-level access control layer to enforce permissions. This layer could centralize authorization checks and provide a more secure way to manage file access.






ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
                        
                           
                           //read file into string
                           $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
                     }
               
}
               
               
```
