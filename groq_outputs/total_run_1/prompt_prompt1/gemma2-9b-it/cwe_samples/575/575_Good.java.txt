VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Use of Hardcoded Values 
EXPLANATION: 
The conversion rate (115.3100) is directly embedded within the code. This makes the application vulnerable to manipulation if the exchange rate changes. An attacker could potentially modify this hardcoded value to perform unauthorized financial transactions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Fetch the exchange rate dynamically:** Retrieve the current US dollar to Yen exchange rate from a reliable external API or database. 
* **Use a configuration file:** Store the exchange rate in a configuration file that can be easily updated without recompiling the application. This allows for more flexibility and control over the conversion rate.
ORIGINAL_CODE:
```java
                  @Statelesspublic class ConverterSessionBean implements ConverterSessionRemoteInterface {
                        
                           
                           /* conversion rate on US dollars to Yen */
                           private BigDecimal yenRate = new BigDecimal("115.3100");
                           public ConverterSessionBean() {}
                           
                           /* remote method to convert US dollars to Yen */
                           
                           public BigDecimal dollarToYen(BigDecimal dollars) {BigDecimal result = dollars.multiply(yenRate);return result.setScale(2, BigDecimal.ROUND_DOWN);}
                     }
