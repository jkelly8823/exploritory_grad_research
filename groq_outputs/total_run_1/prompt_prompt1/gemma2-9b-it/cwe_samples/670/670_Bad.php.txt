VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Direct Code Execution Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a potential direct code execution vulnerability.  The use of `http_redirect`  suggests an attempt to manually redirect the user. However, without proper sanitization or escaping, user input (in this case, the `$requestingIP`) could potentially be manipulated to execute arbitrary code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Avoid Direct Code Injection:**  Do not use functions like `http_redirect`  that directly execute code portions. Employ established redirection techniques, such as the following, to prevent potential code injection vulnerabilities:

   * Use PHP's built-in header() function for redirects:
     ```php
     header('Location: ' . $errorPageURL);
     exit; 
     ```

* **Sanitize Inputs:**  Always sanitize and validate any user input, including IP addresses.  Use prepared statements or parameterized queries if interacting with databases.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
```
