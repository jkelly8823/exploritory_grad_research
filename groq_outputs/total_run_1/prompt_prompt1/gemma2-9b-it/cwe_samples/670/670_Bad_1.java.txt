VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) via `assert` statement
EXPLANATION: 
The use of `assert email != null;` can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. An attacker could craft a request that causes `request.getParameter("email_address")` to return `null`, triggering the `assert` statement. In production environments, `assert` statements are typically compiled out.  However, they can remain in development builds,  and if triggered, will halt program execution. 

This abrupt halt could be exploited by an attacker to temporarily take down a service.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Replace `assert` with proper error handling**: Instead of relying on `assert` to prevent null values, use appropriate error handling mechanisms:
    * Check for null values before using the email parameter.
    * Provide a default value or display an error message if the email parameter is missing.

* **Sanitize user input**: Even if the email parameter is not null, it's crucial to sanitize user input to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection. 

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
String email = request.getParameter("email_address");
assert email != null;
```
