VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Fallthrough Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION:
The `switch` statement in the provided code lacks proper `break` statements after each case.  This leads to a fallthrough vulnerability.  When the month value matches a case, the code will execute that case's block and *automatically* continue to the next case without stopping.

In this code, if the value of `month` is 1, for instance, it will print "January" and then continue to execute the blocks for case 2, case 3, and so on, until it reaches  the end of the `switch` statement. This unintended behavior can lead to unexpected results and security issues.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add `break;` statements at the end of each case block in the `switch` statement to prevent fallthrough:

```java
public void printMessage(int month){
  switch (month) {
    case 1:
      print("January");
      break;
    case 2:
      print("February");
      break;
    // ...add break statements for all cases
   }
  println(" is a great month");
}
```


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                public void printMessage(int month){
                switch (month) {
                
                case 1: print("January");case 2: print("February");case 3: print("March");case 4: print("April");case 5: print("May");case 6: print("June");case 7: print("July");case 8: print("August");case 9: print("September");case 10: print("October");case 11: print("November");case 12: print("December");
                }println(" is a great month");
                }
              
              
              ```
