VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Unexpected Behavior Due to Duplicate Execution

EXPLANATION:  
The code snippet uses a single `if` statement to conditionally execute `Do_X();` and `Do_Y();`. Due to the consecutive placement of the method calls, `Do_Y();` will always be executed regardless of the value of `condition`. This might lead to unintended consequences if  `Do_Y()` should only be executed when `condition` is true.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Indent `Do_Y()` inside the `if` block:** 
   
   ```python
   if (condition==true) {
       Do_X();
       Do_Y(); 
   }
   ```

   This ensures `Do_Y()` is only executed if `condition` is true.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
```python
               if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
               
             ```
