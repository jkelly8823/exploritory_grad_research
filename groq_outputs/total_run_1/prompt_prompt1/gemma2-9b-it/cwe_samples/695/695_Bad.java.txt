VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Code Injection Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `System.loadLibrary("echo")` to load a native library named "echo." This loading of external libraries without proper validation poses a significant risk for code injection attacks. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious library with the same name and inject harmful code into the application when it loads the library.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Validate Library Source:** Never load libraries from untrusted sources. Ensure the library's source is verified and comes from a trusted repository.

2. **Sanitize Library Names:** Avoid using directly user-supplied values in `System.loadLibrary()`. Sanitize any input that might influence the library name to prevent malicious manipulation.

3. **Consider Secure Loading Mechanisms:** Explore more secure library loading mechanisms that provide better control over permissions and potential injection points. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
class Echo {
    
    public native void runEcho();
    static {
                System.loadLibrary("echo");
           }public static void main(String[] args) {
                  new Echo().runEcho();
           }
     } 
```
