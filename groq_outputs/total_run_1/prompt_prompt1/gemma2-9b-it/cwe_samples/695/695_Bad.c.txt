VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `gets(buf)` function is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. The `gets` function reads user input from the standard input (typically the keyboard) until a newline character is encountered and stores it in the `buf` buffer without any bounds checking. If the user enters more than 64 characters, the extra characters will overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer, potentially corrupting other program data or allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace `gets(buf)` with a safer alternative, such as `fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin)`. This function takes a buffer size as an argument and prevents writing beyond the allocated buffer.

ORIGINAL CODE:
        
                  #include <jni.h>#include "Echo.h"//the java class above compiled with javah#include <stdio.h>
                     JNIEXPORT void JNICALLJava_Echo_runEcho(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj){char buf[64];gets(buf);printf(buf);}
