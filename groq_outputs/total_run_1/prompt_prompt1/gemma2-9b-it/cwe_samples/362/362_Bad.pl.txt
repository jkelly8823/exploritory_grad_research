VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Integer Overflow and Error Handling Issues
EXPLANATION:
The code checks for negative transfer amounts and insufficient funds. However, it lacks safeguards against integer overflow. If `$transfer_amount` is exceptionally large, subtracting it from `$balance` could result in an integer overflow, leading to incorrect calculations and potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the `FatalError` function might lead to abrupt application termination without proper logging or recovery mechanisms.  

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Input Validation:** Sanitize `$transfer_amount` to ensure it's within a reasonable range and prevent potential integer overflow.
2. **Secure Error Handling:** Replace `FatalError` with a more robust error handling mechanism. Log errors, provide meaningful messages, and consider retrying transactions or gracefully degrading service.

Original code:
```
$transfer_amount = GetTransferAmount();
$balance = GetBalanceFromDatabase();
if ($transfer_amount < 0) {
    FatalError("Bad Transfer Amount");
}
$newbalance = $balance - $transfer_amount;
if (($balance - $transfer_amount) < 0) {
    FatalError("Insufficient Funds");
}
SendNewBalanceToDatabase($newbalance);
NotifyUser("Transfer of $transfer_amount succeeded.");
NotifyUser("New balance: $newbalance");
```
