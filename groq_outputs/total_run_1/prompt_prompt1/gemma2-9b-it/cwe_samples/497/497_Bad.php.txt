VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection 
EXPLANATION:
The code directly inserts the user's username into a system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the username to execute arbitrary commands on the server. For example, an attacker could provide a username like `' || rm -rf /` which would execute the command `ps aux | grep ' || rm -rf /`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Never directly use user input in system commands.** Use parameterized queries or an alternative approach that avoids string concatenation with untrusted user data.
*   **Sanitize user input:**  Validate and escape user input to prevent malicious code injection. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
//assume getCurrentUser() returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric (avoiding CWE-78)
$userName = getCurrentUser();$command = 'ps aux | grep ' . $userName;system($command);
); 
```
