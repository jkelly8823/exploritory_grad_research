VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  **Potential for Integer Overflow**


EXPLANATION:
The code utilizes the `len(actual_pw)` in a loop index.  While this might appear harmless, it could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability. If `actual_pw` is exceptionally long, `len(actual_pw)` could potentially exceed the maximum value an integer can hold, causing an unexpected behavior in the loop.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a More Robust Range:** Instead of directly using `len(actual_pw)` in the loop index, iterate using `range(len(actual_pw))`. This ensures that the loop iterates through valid indices and avoids potential integer overflow issues.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                 def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
		 
                   if len(actual_pw) <> len(typed_pw):
		   return 0
                   for i in len(actual_pw):
		   if actual_pw[i] <> typed_pw[i]:
		   return 0
                   
                   return 1
