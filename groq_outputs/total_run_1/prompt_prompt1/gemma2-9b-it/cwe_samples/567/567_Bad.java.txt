VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code increments a static integer variable `count` without bounds checking. If `count` reaches its maximum value (the maximum value an integer can hold), incrementing it will lead to an integer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use a larger data type like `long` to store the count, which can hold a wider range of values.
* Implement bounds checking before incrementing the counter. For example, you could limit the count to a specific maximum value.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public static class Counter extends HttpServlet {
    static int count = 0;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest in, HttpServletResponse out)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        out.setContentType("text/plain");
        PrintWriter p = out.getWriter();
        count++;
        p.println(count + " hits so far!");
    }
}
```
