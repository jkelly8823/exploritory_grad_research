VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to access an element outside the bounds of the `id_sequence` array. The array is declared with a size of 3 (`int id_sequence[3];`), but the code tries to access `id_sequence[3]`. Valid indices in this array are 0, 1, and 2. 

Attempting to access an out-of-bounds element can lead to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit this to overwrite memory and execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Limit array indices:** Ensure all array access operations use indices within the valid range (0 to 2 in this case). Review the code where `id_sequence[3]` is used and correct it to access a valid element.
* **Bounds checking:** Implement checks to validate array indices before accessing them. This can help prevent out-of-bounds errors.
* **Consider using fixed-size containers:**  Explore alternative data structures like `std::vector` if the size of the array needs to be flexible.



ORIGINAL CODE: 

```c++
                  int id_sequence[3];
                     /* Populate the id array. */
                     id_sequence[0] = 123;id_sequence[1] = 234;id_sequence[2] = 345;id_sequence[3] = 456;
               
	       
```
