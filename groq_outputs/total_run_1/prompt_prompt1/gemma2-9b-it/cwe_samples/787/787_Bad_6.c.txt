VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet exhibits a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of `strcpy`. 

Here's why:

* **`strstr` Limitation:**  `strstr` does not guarantee the null termination of the found substring.
* **Unbounded Copy:** `strcpy(destBuf + idx, srcBuf)` copies the contents of `srcBuf` into `destBuf` starting at the position `idx` without checking the size of either buffer. If `srcBuf` is larger than the remaining space in `destBuf`, it will overwrite adjacent memory, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounded Copy with Size Check:** Use a safer string copy function that takes the maximum number of characters to copy, such as `strncpy`. 
   ```c
   strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, sizeof(destBuf) - idx - 1);
   destBuf[sizeof(destBuf) - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null termination
   ```
2. **Input Validation:** Validate the length of `srcBuf` before copying. Never copy data directly from an untrusted source into a fixed-size buffer without ensuring its size is within safe bounds.
3. **Secure String Handling:** Explore secure string handling libraries that provide safe functions for operations like string replacement and copying.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
