VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The line `strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.  The `strcpy` function does not perform bounds checking, meaning that if `hp->h_name` is longer than the `hostname` buffer (which has a size of 64 characters), it will write past the allocated memory, potentially overwriting other data and leading to a crash or security exploit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use a safer string copying function like `strncpy` which allows you to specify the maximum length to copy, preventing buffer overflows. For example:

```c
strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, sizeof(hostname) - 1);
hostname[sizeof(hostname) - 1] = '\0'; 
```

* Validate the length of  `hp->h_name` before copying it into the `hostname` buffer.

* Consider using a dynamically allocated buffer for `hostname` whose size can be determined at runtime based on the length of `hp->h_name`.




ORIGINAL CODE:
 ```c
                  void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
                        struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
                           
                           /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */
                           
                           validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
                     }
               }
               
               
 ```
