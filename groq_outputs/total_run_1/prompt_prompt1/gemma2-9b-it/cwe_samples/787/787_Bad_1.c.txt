VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code utilizes `memcpy` to copy data from `srcBuf` to `destBuf`. The size of the copy is determined by `(returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1)`.  The issue lies in the potential for `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` to return a value smaller than the size of `destBuf`. If this happens, the `memcpy` operation could write beyond the bounds of `destBuf`, leading to a buffer overflow.

A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to store more data in a buffer (memory location) than it can hold. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially corrupting data or allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.

In this case, `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` likely depends on the contents of `destBuf` itself. If an attacker can control the content of `destBuf`, they may be able to manipulate `returnChunkSize()` to return a value that triggers the overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the input to `returnChunkSize()` to ensure it always returns a size that is less than or equal to the size of `destBuf`.

2. **Safe Copying Functions:** Use safer memory copying functions like `strncpy` or `strlcpy`, which explicitly limit the number of bytes copied and help prevent buffer overflows.

3. **Bounds Checking:** Add explicit bounds checking within `memcpy` or the calling code to prevent writing past the end of `destBuf`.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                  int returnChunkSize(void *) {
                        
                           
                           /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
                           
                           
                           * else, return -1 to indicate an error
                           
                           
                           */
                           ...
                     }int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
               
               ...}
               
               
               
               ```
