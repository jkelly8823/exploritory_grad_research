VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the line `WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));`. This line allocates memory for the `WidgetList` array based on the user-supplied `numWidgets`.  If a malicious user provides an excessively large value for `numWidgets`, it can cause a buffer overflow.

When `numWidgets` exceeds the expected bounds (MAX_NUM_WIDGETS), the allocated memory will be insufficient. Writing data beyond the allocated memory can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting other data structures or even executing arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Input Validation:**  Enforce stricter bounds checking on the `numWidgets` value.  Ensure that `numWidgets` always falls within a safe range, ideally using a constant like `MAX_NUM_WIDGETS` for the upper limit.

2. **Safe Memory Allocation:** Consider using safer memory allocation techniques like `calloc`, which initializes the allocated memory to zero, reducing the risk of unintended data corruption.

3. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking within the loop `for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++)` to prevent accessing memory locations outside the allocated `WidgetList` array.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  int i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;
                     numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {ExitError("Incorrect number of widgets requested!");}WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));printf("WidgetList ptr=%p\n", WidgetList);for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();}WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;showWidgets(WidgetList);
               );
               
               ```
