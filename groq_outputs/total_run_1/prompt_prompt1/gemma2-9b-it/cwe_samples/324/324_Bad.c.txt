VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential for comparison failure due to assignment instead of comparison in the if condition.

EXPLANATION:
The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {` uses the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the comparison operator (`==`). This means the code snippet is actually assigning the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the variable `cert` and then checking if the result of the assignment is non-zero (which would be true in almost all cases). This could lead to a vulnerability if `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` returns a NULL value, which would typically be considered an error condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {` to `if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {` to ensure proper comparison. Additionally, consider handling the case where `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` returns NULL, as this could indicate an issue with certificate retrieval.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
                        foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERRCERT_NOT_YET_VALID==foo))
                              
                                 
                                 //do stuff
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     }
               
               ```
