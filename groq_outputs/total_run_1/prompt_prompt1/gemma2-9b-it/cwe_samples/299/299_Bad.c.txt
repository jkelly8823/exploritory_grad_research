VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential use of the assignment operator instead of the comparison operator.
EXPLANATION:
In the line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {`, the code uses the single equal sign (`=`), which is the assignment operator. This assigns the value returned by `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the variable `cert` and then checks if the assignment resulted in a non-false value.  

This is problematic because it will always evaluate to true if `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` returns a non-NULL value. This eliminates the intended check for a certificate being available.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Change the line to use the comparison operator (double equal sign `==`) for proper comparison:


```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // ...
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
                        
                           
                           // got a certificate, do secret things
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               ```
