VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper input sanitization and validation.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code directly uses `param('username')` and `param('password')` without any sanitization or validation. This makes the application vulnerable to injection attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker could potentially send malicious input for `username` or `password`, which could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or website manipulation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Use appropriate functions to escape or filter special characters from user input before using it in database queries or displaying it on the page. For example, use parameterized queries in your database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Validate input:** Implement robust input validation checks to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and lengths. Check for valid email addresses, password complexity requirements, and other relevant constraints.

Here's an example of how to improve the code:

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Sanitize username and password
my $username = escape_html(param('username'));
my $password = escape_html(param('password'));

if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1) {
    if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1) {
        print "Login Successful";
    } else {
        print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
    }
} else {
    print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
```

Remember that this is a simplified example, and you should tailor your sanitization and validation logic to the specific requirements of your application.


ORIGINAL CODE:

                  my $username=param('username');
                  my $password=param('password');
                  
                  if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
                  {
                  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
                  {
                  print "Login Successful";
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
                  }
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - unknown username";
                  }
