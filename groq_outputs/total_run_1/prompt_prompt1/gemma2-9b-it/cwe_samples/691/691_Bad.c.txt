VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No obvious vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet. 

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a correct use of a mutex for thread synchronization.  

* `pthread_mutex_lock(mutex)`: This line acquires the mutex lock associated with `mutex`, ensuring that only one thread can access the critical section (the code between the lock and unlock).
* `/* access shared resource */`: This placeholder indicates where the shared resource is accessed. Ideally, this section would contain code that modifies a variable or data structure that multiple threads could potentially contend with.
* `pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)`: This line releases the mutex lock, allowing other threads to acquire it and access the shared resource.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
The code snippet appears to be sound. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
                        pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
                           
                           /* access shared resource */
                           
                           
                           pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
                     }
               
             ```
