VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing error handling for pthread_mutex_unlock.
EXPLANATION:
The code acquires a mutex lock using `pthread_mutex_lock` and checks for errors. However, if `pthread_mutex_lock` fails, the code returns the error code, but it does not handle potential errors from `pthread_mutex_unlock`. If `pthread_mutex_unlock` fails, it could lead to a deadlock or other concurrency issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of `pthread_mutex_unlock` and handle errors appropriately.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
                        int result;
                           result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;
                           
                           
                           /* access shared resource */
                           
                           
                           return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
                     }
