VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for logical inconsistency due to unconditional execution.
EXPLANATION:
If the `condition` evaluates to `true`, `Do_X()` is called. However, `Do_Y()` is called regardless of the value of `condition`.  This might lead to unintended behavior or logic errors if `Do_Y()` relies on a specific condition that `condition` is supposed to represent. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

-   Ensure that `Do_Y()` is only executed if the `condition` is also true:
```
if (condition == true) {
  Do_X();
  Do_Y();
}
```



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
```
