VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `file_get_contents($filename)` function, when used without proper sanitization of the `$filename` parameter, can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could potentially manipulate the `$filename` variable to access files outside the intended directory.  

In this case, the code directly uses the `$filename` variable passed to the function without any validation or sanitization. This opens the possibility for an attacker to provide a filename that includes malicious paths, such as "../secrets.txt", which could allow them to read sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize `$filename`:** Always validate and sanitize user-supplied filenames.  This involves:
    - Escaping special characters that may be used for path traversal.
    - Limiting the path to a predefined set of allowed directories.
    - Using a whitelist approach to only allow specific file names.
2. **Use PHP's built-in `realpath()`:** This function ensures you are working with the absolute path to the file, making path traversal attacks less effective. 

3. **Consider Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement granular access controls to restrict file access based on user roles or permissions.
