VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 

The `run_ping_regex` function directly passes the user-supplied `ip` string into the `subprocess.call` function without sanitizing it, which opens the door to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious `ip` string that includes arbitrary commands, potentially leading to the execution of harmful code on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize user input:**  Before using the `ip` in a subprocess call, heavily sanitize and validate it to ensure it only contains valid IP address characters. Do not rely solely on regular expressions for this, as attackers can sometimes bypass them.

2. **Use a safer subprocess library:** Consider using libraries like `shlex` or `click` which offer better protection against command injection by parsing and quoting user input appropriately.

3. **Limit user privilege:**  Run the ping command with the least privilege necessary. Avoid executing code with root or administrative privileges unless absolutely required.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
		
		  import subprocess
		  import re
		  
		  def validate_ip_regex(ip: str):
		  
		    ip_validator = re.compile(r"((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}")
		    if ip_validator.match(ip):
		    
		      return ip
		    
		    else:
		    
		      raise ValueError("IP address does not match valid pattern.")
		  
		  
		  
		  def run_ping_regex(ip: str):
		  
		    validated = validate_ip_regex(ip)
		    # The ping command treats zero-prepended IP addresses as octal
		    result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
		    print(result)
