VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  7-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user-supplied data from the `URL query` to determine which function to execute. This could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `URL query`.  

**Recommendations:** 

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Always sanitize user-supplied data before using it in any part of your code, especially when constructing URLs or executing functions.

2. **Escaping:**
   Escape special characters in user data to prevent them from being interpreted as code.  Use appropriate escaping techniques based on the context (e.g., URL encoding for `URL` parameters, HTML escaping for content displayed in web pages).

3. **Whitelisting:**
Implement a whitelist of allowed functions or operations. Only allow executions of functions that have been specifically approved.

4. **Input Validation:**
Validate the format and content of user input to ensure it meets expected criteria.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  
                     // iOS
                     -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
                        NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
                              NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                                    
                                       
                                       // Make data available back in webview.
                                       UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
                                 }return NO;
                           }return YES;
                     }
