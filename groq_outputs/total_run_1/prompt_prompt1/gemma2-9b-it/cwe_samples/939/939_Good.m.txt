VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  URL Injection 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code directly constructs a URL string using user-supplied data (`incomingMessage.txt` and `hello`). This opens the door to URL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially modify the `file` or `text` parameters to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user-supplied data before incorporating it into the URL string. This involves escaping special characters and validating the data against a predefined set of allowed values.
- Consider using a URL-building library that provides built-in safeguards against injection attacks.
- Avoid directly constructing URLs from user input whenever possible. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```objectivec
NSString *stringURL = @"appscheme://replaceFileText?file=incomingMessage.txt&text=hello";NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:stringURL];[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url];
```
