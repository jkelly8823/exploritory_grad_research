VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a classic directory traversal vulnerability. It concatenates user-supplied input (`$Username`) directly with a file path (`/home/user/` ) without proper sanitization. 

An attacker could manipulate the  `$Username` variable to include malicious paths, potentially leading to access of sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope. For example, an attacker might input `../../etc/passwd`, aiming to read the system's password file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Never directly use untrusted user input in file paths. 

Validate and sanitize the input to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not attempt to navigate outside the designated directory.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries (if applicable):** If you're using a database, utilize parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks. 

3. **Whitelisting:** Define a whitelist of allowed file names or directories. Only allow file operations within this whitelist.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename); 
```
