VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the direct inclusion of the `userRole` value, which is obtained from a cookie (`c.getValue()`), into the program logic without any sanitization or validation. This opens the door to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

An attacker could potentially manipulate the "role" cookie value to inject malicious JavaScript code. When this code is retrieved and used in the program, it could be executed in the context of the user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or deface the website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before using the `userRole` value, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript code.  You can use a library like OWASP's Encoder to ensure proper sanitization.

2. **Validate user input:** After sanitization, validate the `userRole` value to ensure it conforms to expected data types and formats. This can help prevent unexpected behaviors and potential vulnerabilities.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                  Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();for (int i =0; i< cookies.length; i++) {Cookie c = cookies[i];if (c.getName().equals("role")) {userRole = c.getValue();}}
               
               }}
               
               
               
               ```
