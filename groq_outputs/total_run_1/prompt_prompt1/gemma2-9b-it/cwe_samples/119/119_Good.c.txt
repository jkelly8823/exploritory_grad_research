VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet checks if an array index `index` is within the valid bounds of an array, which has a length `len`. This check aims to prevent an "index out of bounds" error, a common vulnerability. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

The code snippet appears to be safe and follows good practices for array access. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
     // check that the array index is within the correct
     
    
    // range of values for the array
    if (index >= 0 && index < len) {
    ... 
```
