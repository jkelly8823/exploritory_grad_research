VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line 1 (user_supplied_addr), Line 5 (strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name))
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: This code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because the `strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name)` function call does not perform bounds checking. If `hp->h_name` is longer than 64 characters (the size of the `hostname` buffer), it will overwrite memory beyond the allocated space for `hostname`, potentially corrupting other data or leading to a program crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. **Use a safer string copy function:** Replace `strcpy` with `strncpy` and specify the maximum number of characters to copy. For example:

   ```c
   strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, sizeof(hostname) - 1);
   hostname[sizeof(hostname) - 1] = '\0'; 
   ```

   This ensures that only a limited number of characters are copied, preventing buffer overflow.

2. **Validate input length:** Before copying the hostname, check the length of `hp->h_name` and make sure it's within the bounds of the `hostname` buffer.

3. **Use a safer string manipulation library:** Consider using a safer string manipulation library that provides functions with built-in bounds checking, such as  libbsd's string functions or  re-entrant versions in standard libraries


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
                        struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
                           
                           /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */
                           
                           validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
                     }
               }
