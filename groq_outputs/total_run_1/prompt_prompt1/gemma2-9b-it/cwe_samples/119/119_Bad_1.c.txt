VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Code Injection

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential code injection vulnerability.  Specifically, within the `else` block of the loop, the code directly copies characters from `user_supplied_string` into the `dst_buf` without sufficient sanitization. 

An attacker could craft a malicious input string that contains harmful characters or code which might be executed when `dst_buf` is used elsewhere in the program. 

This vulnerability arises because the code blindly trusts the input and doesn't adequately check for potentially dangerous characters. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that the `user_supplied_string` only contains allowed characters.  Consider using a whitelist approach, where you define a set of acceptable characters, or a blacklist approach, where you filter out known dangerous characters.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries (if applicable):** If the input is being used in database queries or other command execution contexts, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This approach separates data from code, preventing malicious code from being directly injected.

3. **Escape Special Characters:** If you must directly incorporate user input into strings, properly escape any special characters that could be interpreted as code, such as `<`, `>`, `&`, and `;`. Depending on the context, you might need to use different escaping mechanisms (e.g., HTML encoding, SQL escaping).



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char * copy_input(char *user_supplied_string){
    int i, dst_index;
    char *dst_buf = (char*)malloc(4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE);
    if ( MAX_SIZE <= strlen(user_supplied_string) ){
        die("user string too long, die evil hacker!");
    }
    dst_index = 0;
    for ( i = 0; i < strlen(user_supplied_string); i++ ){ 
        if( '&' == user_supplied_string[i] ){
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = '&';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'a';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'm';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'p';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = ';';
        }else if ('<' == user_supplied_string[i] ){
            /* encode to &lt; */
        }else 
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];
    }
    return dst_buf;
}
```
