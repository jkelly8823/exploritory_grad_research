VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-Bounds Array Access
EXPLANATION:

The code snippet calls a function `GetUntrustedOffset()` which likely returns an integer value from an untrusted source. The value returned by this function is then used directly as an index for the `items` array in the `printf()` statement.  

If `GetUntrustedOffset()` returns a value greater than or equal to the size of the `items` array (which has 4 elements), then `items[index-1]` will attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the array, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate the input:** Before using the value returned by `GetUntrustedOffset()`, validate it to ensure it is within the valid range for the `items` array (0 to 3). You can do this by adding a check like:

   ```c
   int index = GetUntrustedOffset();

   if (index >= 0 && index <= 3) {
       printf("You selected %s\n", items[index-1]);
   } else {
       // Handle invalid input, e.g., print an error message
       printf("Invalid selection.\n"); 
   }
   ```

2. **Use safe bounds checking:** Consider using safer functions for array access that automatically handle out-of-bounds checks, such as `std::vector` in C++. 



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
     int main (int argc, char **argv) {char *items[] = {"boat", "car", "truck", "train"};int index = GetUntrustedOffset();printf("You selected %s\n", items[index-1]);}
```
