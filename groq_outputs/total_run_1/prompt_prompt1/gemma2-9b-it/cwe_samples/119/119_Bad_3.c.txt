VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Out-of-bounds array access
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if `index` is less than the length of the array (`len`). However, if `index` is greater than or equal to `len`, it accesses `array[index]` directly, leading to an out-of-bounds array access. This can cause undefined behavior, such as a segmentation fault or reading uninitialized memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Handle out-of-bounds access with a more robust error handling mechanism:** Instead of simply accessing `array[index]` and printing an error message, consider throwing an exception or returning a specific error code to indicate that the index is invalid.
* **Implement bounds checking more effectively:** Instead of just checking if `index` is less than `len`, check if it is within the valid range of indices (inclusive from 0 to `len-1`). You can modify the condition to `if (0 <= index && index < len)` for better clarity.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value;
    
    // check that the array index is less than the maximum
    
    
    // length of the array
    if (index < len) {
       
         // get the value at the specified index of the array
         value = array[index];
    }
    // if array index is invalid then output error message
    
    // and return value indicating error
    else {printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);value = -1;}
    return value;
}
```
