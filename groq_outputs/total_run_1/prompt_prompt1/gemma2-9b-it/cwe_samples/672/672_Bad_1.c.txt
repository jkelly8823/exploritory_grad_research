VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code demonstrates a double free vulnerability.  The line `free(ptr);` is executed twice. The first free occurs within the `if (abrt) {free(ptr);}` block, and the second free happens outside of this block. Attempting to free memory that has already been freed leads to a double free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Remove the duplicate free call:**  
   Delete one of the `free(ptr)` statements.  The most secure approach is to free the memory once,  immediately after you are finished using it. 


2. **Error Handling:**
   Ensure robust error handling for `malloc`. If `malloc` fails to allocate memory (returns NULL), handle the error appropriately. Avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr); 
```

 **Important Note:**  Unintentional double frees can lead to crashes, memory corruption, and security exploits. Always carefully review your code to prevent them.
