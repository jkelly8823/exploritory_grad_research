VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The `do_listing` subroutine directly embeds the user-supplied `$fname` argument into the system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system. For example, an attacker could provide a filename like `; rm -rf /` which would execute the command `"/bin/ls -l ; rm -rf /"` resulting in the deletion of all files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Use parameterized queries or a safer alternative to `system()`:** Instead of directly concatenating the user input into the command string, use a safer method like parameterized queries or a library designed for executing external commands securely.

2. **Sanitize user input:**  Validate and sanitize the user input to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not contain any potentially harmful commands.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                    
					my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
					do_listing($arg);
					

					sub do_listing {
					
						my($fname) = @_;
						if (! validate_name($fname)) {
							
							print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
							return;
							
						}
						# build command
						my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
						system($cmd);
					
					}
					
					sub validate_name {
					
						my($name) = @_;
						if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {
						
							return(1);
						
						}
						else {
						
							return(0);
						
						}
					
					}
