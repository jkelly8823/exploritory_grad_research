VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user input from `$_POST["user"]` in the construction of a command executed via `system()`. This creates a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could provide malicious input in the `user` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

For example, an attacker could submit a username like `'; rm -rf /';` which would execute the command `ls -l /home/; rm -rf /`, potentially deleting all files on the server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1.  **Sanitize User Input:** Never directly use user input in commands without proper sanitization.  Escape special characters within the username before using it in the path.
2. **Use Safe Alternatives to `system()`:**  Avoid using `system()` for executing shell commands. Use safer alternatives like `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, or built-in commands if possible.  When using these alternatives, avoid directly concatenating user input with command strings.
3. **Limit User Permissions:** Run the web server with the least privileges necessary.  If the web server process doesn't have elevated permissions, the impact of a successful command injection attack will be limited.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$userName = $_POST["user"];
$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;
system($command);
```
