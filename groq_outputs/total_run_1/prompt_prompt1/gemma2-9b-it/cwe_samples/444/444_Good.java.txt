VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to infinite loop. 

EXPLANATION:
The code checks for multiple "Content-Length" headers in an HTTP request.  If it finds more than one, it indicates an error condition. However,  the code lacks a robust way to handle the error scenario (lines 14-19). Without proper error handling, the application could potentially enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An attacker could craft requests with a large number of duplicate "Content-Length" headers, exhausting server resources or causing the application to become unresponsive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:**  Validate and sanitize the `contentLengthHeaders` before processing them. This can help prevent malformed input that might cause issues.
2. **Limit Processing:** Implement a limit on the number of headers processed to prevent against excessive iterations.
3. **Log and Handle Errors:** Instead of just outputting an error response, log the error condition and consider using a more resilient approach to handling the request. This could involve returning a specific error code or temporarily throttling requests from the source.
4. **Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent malicious requests from overwhelming the server.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
				  
                    
                      
                      // Set up response writer object
                      ...try {
					  
						
                          // check for multiple content length headers
                          Enumeration contentLengthHeaders = request.getHeaders("Content-Length");
						  int count = 0;
						  while (contentLengthHeaders.hasMoreElements()) {
						  count++;
						  }
						  if (count > 1) {
						  
							// output error response
							}
							else {
							
							  
								// process request
							  
							  }
							  
                        
                    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
					}
				  
  
               
            ```
