VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability  
EXPLANATION: The `uri="*"` attribute within the `<domain>` tag allows access from any domain. This open policy could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a request, and since the policy allows access from any domain, this code could be executed on any website that uses this access policy.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. **Restrict the `uri` attribute:** Instead of using `uri="*"` , specify the allowed domains explicitly. This will limit the potential attack surface.
   
   ```xml
   <allow-from http-request-headers="SOAPAction"><domain uri="https://example.com"/></allow-from>
   ```
   
2. **Sanitize user input:** When handling user input that could be included in the `uri` attribute, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters.
