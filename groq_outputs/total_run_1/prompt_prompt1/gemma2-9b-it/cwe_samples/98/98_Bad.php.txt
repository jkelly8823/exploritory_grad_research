VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
EXPLANATION:

The code directly includes a file specified by the user-supplied input `$_GET['module_name']`. This creates a critical vulnerability because an attacker could manipulate the `module_name` parameter to include malicious files on the server.  If a malicious user submits a crafted `module_name` value, they could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:


1. **Validate and Sanitize Input:**

   -  Never directly include user-supplied input into files.
   - Sanitize and validate the `$_GET['module_name']` input to ensure it only contains allowed characters and patterns.
   - Consider using a whitelist of allowed module names.

2. **Use a Secure Include Method:**

   -  Instead of using `include()`, explore safer alternatives that provide more control over file inclusion, such as:
     - **require_once()**: Prevents multiple inclusions of the same file.
     - **spl_autoload_register()**: Dynamically loads classes based on a predefined set of rules.

3. **Limit Permissions:**

   - Ensure the PHP process running this script has limited permissions to prevent attackers from executing unauthorized code.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$dir = $_GET['module_name']; 
include($dir . "/function.php"); 
```
