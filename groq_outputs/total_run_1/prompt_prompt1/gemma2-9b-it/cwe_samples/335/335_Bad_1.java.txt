VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of System.currentTimeMillis() for random number seed.
EXPLANATION: 
Using `System.currentTimeMillis()` as a seed for a `Random` object can lead to deterministic randomness, meaning the same seed will always produce the same sequence of "random" numbers. This is a problem because it can be exploited by attackers to predict future values, compromising security applications that rely on unpredictable numbers (e.g., cryptography, session tokens). 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like `SecureRandom` instead of `Random`.
- If using `Random`, obtain a better seed from a truly random source (e.g., hardware entropy) or a pre-generated list of non-sequential random numbers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
                  int accountID = random.nextInt();
```
