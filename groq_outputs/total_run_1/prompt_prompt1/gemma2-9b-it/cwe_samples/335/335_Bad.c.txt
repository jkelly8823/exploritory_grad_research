VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None identified
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet generates a random number using `srand(time())` to seed the random number generator and then uses `rand()` to produce a random integer. While this technique is sound, the extraneous `();` statements at the end do not introduce any vulnerabilities. They appear to be syntactical errors or placeholders.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Remove the extraneous `();` statements.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  srand(time());int randNum = rand();
               
               ();
               
               
               
               
```
