VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of a static seed in a Random number generator. 
EXPLANATION: 

The use of a static seed value (`SEED = 1234567890`) in the `Random` constructor makes the generated sequence of random numbers deterministic. 

Because the seed is constant, every call to `generateAccountID()` will produce the same sequence of "random" numbers. This is a significant security issue, as it allows an attacker to predict account IDs  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG):**
 

Consider using a CSPRNG like `java.security.SecureRandom` for generating account IDs or other critical values that require true randomness.

* **Obtain a truly random seed:** If you must use a `Random` object, ensure the seed is obtained from a truly random source (e.g., reading from a physical device or using a hardware random number generator) to avoid determinism.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
private static final long SEED = 1234567890;
public int generateAccountID() {
Random random = new Random(SEED);
return random.nextInt();
}
```
