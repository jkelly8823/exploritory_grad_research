VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Security Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The code demonstrates a potential security vulnerability related to data classification. Within the `soc` module, the line  `.data_in_security_level(1'b0)`  is hardcoding a security level of 0 for the `data_in_security_level` input of the `tz_peripheral` module. This suggests that all data passed to the `tz_peripheral` is being treated as secure, potentially bypassing intended security checks. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Dynamic Security Level Assignment:** Instead of hardcoding the security level, determine it dynamically based on the context of the data being sent to the `tz_peripheral`. This could involve using a flag, tag, or other mechanism to indicate the data's security classification. 
* **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation in both the `soc` and `tz_peripheral` modules to ensure that the `data_in_security_level` input adheres to expected values and ranges. This helps prevent unexpected security settings from being inadvertently applied.



ORIGINAL CODE:
			      // IP definition
			      module tz_peripheral(clk, reset, data_in, data_in_security_level, ...);
			      
				input clk, reset;
				input [31:0] data_in;
				input data_in_security_level;
				...
			      
			      endmodule
			      // Instantiation of IP in a parent system
			      module soc(...)
			      
				...
				tz_peripheral u_tz_peripheral(
				
				  .clk(clk),
				  .rst(rst),
				  .data_in(rdata),
				  //Copy-and-paste error or typo grounds data_in_security_level (in this example 0=secure, 1=non-secure)
				  .data_in_security_level(1'b0),
				
				);
				...
			      
			      endmodule
