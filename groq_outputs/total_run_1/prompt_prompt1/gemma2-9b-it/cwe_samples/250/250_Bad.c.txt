VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION:  The code snippet uses `fopen(argv[1], "r+");`  to open a file specified by the user-provided argument `argv[1]`. Without proper sanitization, this opens the door to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could provide an argument like "../etc/password" to potentially access sensitive system files outside the intended directory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Always validate and sanitize user-supplied paths before using them in system calls like `fopen`.



2. **Limit File Access:** Consider using a whitelist of allowed file paths or directories to restrict access to only authorized locations.

3. **Use Safe Functions:** Explore more secure alternatives to `fopen` that offer built-in protections against path traversal attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
chroot(APP_HOME); chdir("/");FILE* data = fopen(argv[1], "r+");... 
```
