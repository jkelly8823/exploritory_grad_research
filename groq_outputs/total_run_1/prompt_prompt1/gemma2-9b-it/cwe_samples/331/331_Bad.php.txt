VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Random Number Generation
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `srand($userID)` to seed the random number generator. This is problematic because it means the random numbers generated will be deterministic based on the `$userID`. An attacker could potentially predict future session IDs if they know or can guess the `$userID`, compromising the security of the session.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

*  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) instead of PHP's built-in `rand()` function.  
*  Avoid seeding the random number generator with easily predictable values like user IDs. Use a more robust source of entropy, such as:
    * `/dev/urandom` (Unix-like systems)
    * Windows Crypto API's functions
    *  A dedicated hardware random number generator

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```php
function generateSessionID($userID){srand($userID);return rand();}();}
```
