VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Assignment within a comparison

EXPLANATION:
The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {` uses the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`. This means that the code is assigning the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the variable `cert` instead of comparing it to `true`.  This will always evaluate to true regardless of the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the `=` operator to `==`:

```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got a certificate, do secret things
}
```



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
                        
                           
                           // got a certificate, do secret things
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               ```
