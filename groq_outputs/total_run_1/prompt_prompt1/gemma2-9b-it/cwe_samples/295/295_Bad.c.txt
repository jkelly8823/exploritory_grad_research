VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Lines 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for buffer overflow due to use of `strlen()` without checking the result and potential for a division by zero issue.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to buffer overflow and a possible division by zero.

* **Potential Buffer Overflow:** The line `foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);` assigns the result of `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` to the variable `foo`. However, it's unclear from the snippet the size of `foo`. If `foo` is a fixed-size buffer and the result of `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` exceeds its capacity, a buffer overflow could occur. Buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution and other security issues.

   * **Missing Length Check:** To mitigate this risk, you should always ascertain the length of data you are about to store in a buffer. Compare the length against the buffer's size and avoid writing beyond its bounds.

* **Division by Zero Risk:** The condition in your `if` statement, `X509_V_OK == foo || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN == foo`, assumes that `foo` is a numerical value. If `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` returns a non-numerical value, you could encounter a type mismatch or even a division by zero error during evaluation.

   * **Validation:**  Before comparing `foo` to these constants, ensure it has the expected data type and range. You might need to check for valid return codes from `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` and handle them appropriately.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize Input:** Check the length of the data returned by `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` and ensure it fits within the allocated buffer size for `foo` to prevent buffer overflows.

2. **Type Checking:** Validate the data type returned by `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)`. If it's not numerical, handle it accordingly to avoid type errors or division by zero. 
3. **Error Handling:**  Consider adding error handling for unexpected return values from SSL functions.

The provided snippet requires significant refactoring to ensure secure and robust handling of SSL certificate verification.


ORIGINAL CODE: 



                  if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host)foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
                     if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))
                        
                           
                           // certificate looks good, host can be trusted
