VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Incorrect comparison operator in the conditional statement.
EXPLANATION:

The code uses the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==` in the `if` condition.  This means the code is assigning the value returned by `SSL_get_peer` to the variable `cert`, rather than comparing it to a value. As a result, the `if` statement will always evaluate to true, potentially bypassing intended checks and leading to security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Change the comparison operator from `=` to `==` :

```
if (SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) == 1) { 
   // rest of the code
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
                        foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))
                              
                                 
                                 //do stuff
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
```
