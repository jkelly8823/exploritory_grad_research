VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `strncpy` to copy a filename into a fixed-size buffer `buf` without ensuring that the input filename length does not exceed the buffer's capacity. If `length` is greater than `LOG_INPUT_SIZE` (40), `strncpy` will write past the end of the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or data into the program, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or remote code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use `snprintf` instead of `strncpy`.** `snprintf` takes the buffer size as an argument and will automatically truncate the string if it exceeds the buffer limit, preventing buffer overflows.
2. **Perform input validation.** Validate the input filename length before copying it into the buffer. Ensure that the length is less than or equal to `LOG_INPUT_SIZE`.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 #define LOG_INPUT_SIZE 40
                     
                     // saves the file name to a log file
                     int outputFilenameToLog(char *filename, int length) {
                        int success;
                           
                           // buffer with size set to maximum size for input to log file
                           char buf[LOG_INPUT_SIZE];
                           
                           // copy filename to buffer
                           strncpy(buf, filename, length);
                           
                           // save to log file
                           success = saveToLogFile(buf);
                           return success;
                     }
               
               ```
