VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: LineNumbers /  Line containing strncpy 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `strncpy(buf, filename, sizeof(buf)-1);`  This function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not ensure that the length of the `filename` is less than or equal to the size of the buffer `buf` minus 1. If `filename` is longer than `sizeof(buf) - 1` characters, the extra data will overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to a crash or the execution of malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use `snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%s", filename);` instead of `strncpy()`. `snprintf()` takes the size of the buffer as an argument and will automatically truncate the string if it is too long, preventing buffer overflows.
* Always validate the length of input data before copying it to a buffer.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
// copy filename to buffer
strncpy(buf, filename, sizeof(buf)-1);
```
