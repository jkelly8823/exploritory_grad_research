VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The `strncpy` function is used to copy a string, but it doesn't properly handle the boundary condition. 

The code `strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(source)-1);` attempts to copy the contents of `source` (a string of 21 characters) into `dest` (an array of only 12 characters). 

This can lead to a buffer overflow because:

* `strncpy` stops copying when it encounters the null terminator (`\0`), it doesn't automatically ensure that the copy is within the bounds of the destination buffer.

When the source string (`source`) is longer than the destination buffer (`dest`), the extra characters will be written outside the allocated memory for `dest`, potentially overwriting other data in adjacent memory locations. This can cause program crashes or allow malicious code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use `strncpy` with caution:** When using `strncpy`, always ensure that the maximum length of the source string is less than or equal to the size of the destination buffer minus 1 (to account for the null terminator).
* **Use safer alternatives:** Consider using functions that are better suited for safe string copying, such as `snprintf`. 
   * `snprintf` takes the size of the destination buffer as an argument and will automatically truncate the string if necessary, preventing buffer overflows.

```c
// Safer alternative using snprintf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char source[21] = "the character string";
  char dest[12];

  snprintf(dest, sizeof(dest), "%s", source); // Safely copy string to dest
  
  printf("dest: %s\n", dest); 
  return 0;
}
```



ORIGINAL CODE:

`...char source[21] = "the character string";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(source)-1);...`
