VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION: The code uses `strncpy` to copy data from the `source` buffer to the `dest` buffer. The issue is that `sizeof(dest)-1` doesn't guarantee that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the entire contents of the `source` buffer. 

If the `source` buffer contains more than 11 characters (the size of `dest` minus 1), the remaining characters will be written beyond the bounds of the `dest` buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use `snprintf`:**  `snprintf` provides better bounds checking and is safer for string copying.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   char source[21] = "the character string";
   char dest[12];

   snprintf(dest, sizeof(dest), "%s", source); // Safe string copy
   ```

2. **Explicitly check the length of source before copying:**
   ```c
   char source[21] = "the character string";
   char dest[12];
   int len = strlen(source);  // Get length of source

   if (len < sizeof(dest)) {
       strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest) - 1);
       dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null termination
   } else {
       // Handle overflow scenario - log an error, truncate, etc.
   }
   ```


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
...char source[21] = "the character string";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(dest)-1);...
```
