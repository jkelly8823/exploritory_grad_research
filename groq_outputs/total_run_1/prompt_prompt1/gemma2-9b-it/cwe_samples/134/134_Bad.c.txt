VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the `memcpy(buf, argv[1], 5012);` line within the `main` function. 

Buffer overflows occur when a program attempts to write more data into a buffer (in this case, `buf`) than it can hold. The `argv[1]` argument is assumed to contain user input, and `memcpy` blindly copies it into `buf` without checking the length. If the user provides input exceeding 5012 characters (the size of `buf`), it will overwrite adjacent memory, potentially corrupting other data or allowing for code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Limit input size:**

Sanitize user input and ensure it doesn't exceed the buffer's capacity. Use functions like `strncpy` which allow specifying a maximum copy length.

* **Bounds checking:** Implement checks before and during the copying process to prevent overflows.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
               #include <stdio.h>
               void printWrapper(char *string) {
          
                   printf(string);
               }
               int main(int argc, char **argv) {
            
                   char buf[5012];
                   memcpy(buf, argv[1], 5012); 
                   printWrapper(argv[1]);
                   return (0);
               }
           }
           
           ```
