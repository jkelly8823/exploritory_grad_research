VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `snprintf` to format a string from the argument `argv[1]` and store it in a fixed-size buffer `buf` of 128 characters. If the user provides an argument longer than 127 characters (remembering to account for the null terminator), the `snprintf` function will write beyond the allocated space for `buf`, leading to a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can allow attackers to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially corrupting data or executing malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Input Validation:** Always validate the length of user input before using it in functions like `snprintf`. Check if the length of `argv[1]` is less than or equal to 127 characters.

2. **Safe String Functions:** Consider using safer string functions like `strncpy` or `strlcpy` which limit the number of characters written to the destination buffer, preventing buffer overflows.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv){
  char buf[128];
  snprintf(buf,128,argv[1]);
}
```
