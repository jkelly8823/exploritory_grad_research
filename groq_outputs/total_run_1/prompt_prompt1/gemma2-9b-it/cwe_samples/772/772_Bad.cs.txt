VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `queryString` variable is directly used in the SQL command without any sanitization. This makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the value of `queryString` to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. 

For example, if `queryString` were to contain `' OR 1=1 --`, it could bypass authentication checks and grant access to all data in the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterize your SQL queries:** Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL string, use parameterized queries. This involves using placeholders in the SQL query and providing the values separately. Most database libraries (like ADO.NET) offer methods for parameterized queries. 

   Here's an example using ADO.NET:

   ```csharp
   string connString = "...";
   string queryString = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName = @ProductName";
   string productName = "Laptop"; 

   using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString))
   {
       conn.Open();
       using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString, conn))
       {
           cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ProductName", productName);
           SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
           HarvestResults(rdr);
       }
   }
   ```

  2. **Input Validation:**  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This includes:
     * **Escaping special characters:**  Escape characters like single quote ('), double quote ("), semicolon (;), etc., to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL commands. 
     * **Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, known-safe characters or patterns in the input.

ORIGINAL CODE:



```csharp
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);
cmd.Connection = conn;
conn.Open();
SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
HarvestResults(rdr);
conn.Connection.Close();
```
