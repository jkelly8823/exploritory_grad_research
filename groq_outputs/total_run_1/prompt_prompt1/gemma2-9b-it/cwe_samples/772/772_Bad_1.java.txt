VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet you provided attempts to connect to a database using a JDBC connection string.  The issue lies in the fact that it directly inserts the `some_connection_string` variable into the connection URL without any sanitization. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.

An attacker could manipulate the `some_connection_string` variable to inject malicious SQL code into the query. For example, if `some_connection_string` contained `jdbc:mysql://database.com/users?username=admin%20and%201=1--`, the connection attempt would succeed even if the username is incorrect due to the injected SQL  `and 1=1--`.  This bypasses authentication and allows the attacker to potentially access sensitive database information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Parameterize your database queries.** Instead of directly inserting the entire connection string, use parameterized queries where values are passed as separate parameters. The database driver will handle escaping these values correctly, preventing malicious code injection.

* **Input validation:** Validate and sanitize any user-supplied input that is used in constructing the connection string. This can help prevent malicious data from being injected in the first place.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}  
```
