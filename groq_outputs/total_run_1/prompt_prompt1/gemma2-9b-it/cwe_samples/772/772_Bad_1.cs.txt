VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a direct insertion of a user-supplied `queryString` into a SQL statement without proper sanitization. This makes the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `queryString` to execute unintended SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or even system compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterize SQL Queries:** 
   Instead of directly embedding `queryString` into the SQL statement, use parameterized queries. This involves replacing variables in the SQL statement with placeholders, and then providing values for these placeholders separately.  

   ```csharp
   string queryString = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName LIKE @ProductName"; 
   SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString, conn);
   cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ProductName", "%" + productName + "%");  // Sanitize and escape productName here
   SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader(); 
   ```

2. **Input Validation:**
   Always validate and sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This includes:

   - Escaping special characters that could be misinterpreted as SQL code.
   - Checking for unexpected data types or formats.
   - Limiting the length of input to prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);
cmd.Connection = conn;
conn.Open();
SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
HarvestResults(rdr);
conn.Connection.Close();
```
