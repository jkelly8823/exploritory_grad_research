VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION:
The code dynamically allocates memory for `table_ptr` using `malloc` based on the value of `num_imgs`. However,  there is no check to ensure that `num_imgs` is a valid value that doesn't lead to memory overflow. If `get_num_imgs()` returns a value larger than the available memory or a maliciously crafted input, the `malloc` operation could result in a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate `num_imgs`:** Before allocating memory, validate that `num_imgs` is within a reasonable range and does not exceed the maximum allowable number of images.

   ```c
   // Example validation:
   if (num_imgs <= 0 || num_imgs > MAX_IMAGES) {
       // Handle error: invalid number of images
       return; // Or log an error
   }
   ```

2. **Use safe memory allocation functions:** Consider using safer memory allocation functions like `realloc` or memory-constrained allocation libraries that automatically handle buffer overflow risks.

3. **Input Sanitization:** If `num_imgs` comes from user input, sanitize it carefully to prevent arbitrary input values from causing buffer overflows.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;            
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
... 
```
