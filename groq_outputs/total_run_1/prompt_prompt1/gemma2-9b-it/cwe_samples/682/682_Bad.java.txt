VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential ArithmeticException
EXPLANATION:
The code performs a division operation (yardsGained / touchdowns).  If `touchdowns` is zero, this will result in a runtime `ArithmeticException` (division by zero) error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a check to handle the scenario where `touchdowns` is zero to prevent the exception. Here's an example:

```java
int touchdowns = team.getTouchdowns();
int yardsGained = team.getTotalYardage();
if (touchdowns > 0) {
  System.out.println(team.getName() + " averages " + yardsGained / touchdowns + " yards gained for every touchdown scored");
} else {
  System.out.println(team.getName() + " has not scored any touchdowns.");
}
```


OR use a try-catch block to handle the exception gracefully:



```java
int touchdowns = team.getTouchdowns();
int yardsGained = team.getTotalYardage();
try {
  System.out.println(team.getName() + " averages " + yardsGained / touchdowns + " yards gained for every touchdown scored");
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
  System.out.println(team.getName() + " has not scored any touchdowns.");
}



 ORIGINAL CODE:
                  ...int touchdowns = team.getTouchdowns();int yardsGained = team.getTotalYardage();System.out.println(team.getName() + " averages " + yardsGained / touchdowns + "yards gained for every touchdown scored");...  
```
