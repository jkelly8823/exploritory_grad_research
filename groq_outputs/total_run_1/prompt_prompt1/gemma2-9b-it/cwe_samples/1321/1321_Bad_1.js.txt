VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype Pollution

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to set properties on an empty object (`{}`) using `setValueByPath()`.  The lines

```
setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
```

are particularly dangerous.  By setting properties on  `__proto__` and  `constructor.prototype`, an attacker could potentially:

* **Bypass access controls:** An attacker could gain unintended access to administrative functions or sensitive data.
* **Modify object behaviors:** By altering prototype chains, an attacker could hijack the functionality of existing objects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize input:**  Never directly trust user-provided data when manipulating object properties, especially prototype chains. Validate and sanitize any input used in `setValueByPath()` to prevent malicious manipulation.
* **Avoid modifying prototypes:**  If possible, avoid modifying the prototypes of built-in objects or user-defined constructors.   This drastically reduces the attack surface.
* **Use safe alternatives:** Explore safer alternatives like using properties directly on the target object or employing a whitelist of allowed property names.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
