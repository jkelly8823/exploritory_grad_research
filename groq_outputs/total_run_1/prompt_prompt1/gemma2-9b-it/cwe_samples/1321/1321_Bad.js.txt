VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Prototype Pollution

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability to prototype pollution. In essence, this vulnerability stems from the way the code creates nested objects dynamically.  Here's the breakdown:

1. **Path Splitting:** The code splits the provided `path` using "." as a delimiter.  This allows navigation into deeply nested object structures.

2. **Object Modification**:  The loop iterates through each attribute in the `pathArray`. If an attribute doesn't exist as an object, it's replaced with an empty object (`{}`).  

3. **Crucial Step**: The line `objectToModify[attr] = {};` is the vulnerable part. An attacker could manipulate the `path` parameter to insert malicious attributes that modify the prototype chain of the target object.  

   Since we're overwriting existing attributes or creating new ones dynamically, an attacker could potentially add properties to the prototype of an object, leading to unintended behavior and data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize Input:** The most crucial step is to rigorously sanitize the `path` input.  Reject any paths that contain unusual characters or symbols that could be indicative of an attempt to exploit prototype pollution.
2. **Use a Controlled Access Mechanism:**  Instead of dynamically creating nested objects, consider using a more controlled mechanism. For example: 
   - **Immutable Object Literals:** If possible, use immutable object literals for configuration or data structures. Impossibility of modification makes it harder for attackers to tamper with prototypes.
   - **Object Mapping:** Maintain a registered mapping of allowed attributes within the object structure. Only allow modifications to attributes present in this mapping.


ORIGINAL CODE:





					function setValueByPath (object, path, value) {
					
					    const pathArray = path.split(".");
					    const attributeToSet = pathArray.pop();
					    let objectToModify = object;
					    for (const attr of pathArray) {
					    if (typeof objectToModify[attr] !== 'object') {
					    objectToModify[attr] = {};
					        }
					        objectToModify = objectToModify[attr];
					    }
					    objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
					    return object;
					}
