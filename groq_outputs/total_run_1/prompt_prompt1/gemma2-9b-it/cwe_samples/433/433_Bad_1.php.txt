VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$username` and `$password`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This opens the door to SQL injection attacks, where malicious users could manipulate the input to execute unintended SQL commands on the database. 

For example, an attacker could enter a username like `' OR 1=1 --` which might bypass authentication checks or allow access to sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterize SQL Queries:** Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL strings, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) where input values are treated as separate parameters. This prevents the interpreter from treating user input as executable code.

2. **Sanitize User Input:**  Before using user input in any SQL query, rigorously sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters. Validate input lengths and data types to further mitigate risks.

3. **Escape Special Characters:**  When using plain SQL queries, escape special characters like single quotes (') and backslashes (\\) that could be used for injection. However, parameterization is generally the preferred and more secure approach. 


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```php
<?php
include('database.inc');
$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);
$db->authenticateUser($username, $password);
?>
