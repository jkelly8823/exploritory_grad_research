VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Database Credentials

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet stores database credentials (database name and password) directly within the PHP code. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive information to anyone who has access to the codebase.  An attacker gaining access to the source code could easily extract this information and potentially compromise the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables and retrieve them using PHP's `getenv()` function. This keeps the credentials out of the code and allows for easier management.
* **Configuration Files:** Create a separate configuration file (e.g., `config.php`) to store sensitive information. This file can be kept outside the main code directory and have access controls.
* **Secrets Management:**  Implement a dedicated secrets management system for securely storing and managing sensitive data, such as database credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?> 
```
