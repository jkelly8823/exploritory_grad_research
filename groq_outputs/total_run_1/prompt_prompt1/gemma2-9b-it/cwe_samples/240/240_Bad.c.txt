VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow 
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking when copying data from `msg->msgBody` into the `message` buffer. The `for` loop iterates based on `msg->msgLength`, which could potentially exceed the size of the `message` buffer (`MESSAGE_SIZE`).  This can lead to a buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the allocated memory space. 

If `msg->msgLength` is larger than `MESSAGE_SIZE`, the code will write data past the end of `message`, overwriting adjacent memory. This can result in unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even malicious code injection if an attacker controls the `msg->msgLength` value. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Ensure Buffer Size is Sufficient:** Sanitize or truncate `msg->msgLength` to prevent it from exceeding `MESSAGE_SIZE`.
* **Use Safe String Handling Functions:**  Employ functions like `strncpy` or `strlcpy` to safely copy string data while limiting the number of characters written to the destination buffer. These functions prevent buffer overflows by ensuring that a null terminator is always placed, even if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.



 ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                  int processMessageFromSocket(int socket) {
                        int success;
                           char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];char message[MESSAGE_SIZE];
                           
                           // get message from socket and store into buffer
                           
                           //Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER_SIZE
                           if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0) {
                              
                                 
                                 // place contents of the buffer into message structure
                                 ExMessage *msg = recastBuffer(buffer);
                                 
                                 // copy message body into string for processing
                                 int index;for (index = 0; index < msg->msgLength; index++) {message[index] = msg->msgBody[index];}message[index] = '\0';
                                 
                                 // process message
                                 success = processMessage(message);
                           }return success;
                     }
```
