VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. 

The `fgets` function reads data from standard input (`stdin`) and stores it in the `buffer` array. However, `fgets` only reads up to `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE - 1` characters to ensure null-termination. If a user enters more than 1023 characters, it will overwrite memory beyond the bounds of the `buffer` array, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation to ensure that the user enters a maximum of `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE - 1` characters. You can achieve this by:
    * Checking the length of the input before passing it to `fgets`.
    * Using a safer alternative like `scanf with a format specifier and a size limit`.
2. **Bounds Checking:** Perform bounds checking after using `fgets` to ensure that the input length doesn't exceed the buffer size.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
enum { MAX_BUFFER_SIZE = 1024 };
char buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];
fgets(buffer, MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, stdin);
```
