VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 5 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Logic Error and Missing Verification 
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet has two potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Assignment vs. Comparison:** 
   - Line 1 uses `cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)`, which assigns the result of the function call to the `cert` variable. This is not a comparison. This means the if statement will always be true, leading to unintended behavior.  It should likely be `cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)`

2. **Missing Verification:** 
   -  While the code initially checks the verification result (`if (X509_V_OK==foo)`) , it proceeds to perform actions without re-checking the verification status (`foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)`) on the subsequent lines. This could result in actions being taken with an invalid or untrusted certificate.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use Comparison:** Change `cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to `if (SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) != NULL) { ... }`  this checks if a certificate was successfully retrieved.

2. **Ensure Consistent Verification:** Re-verify the certificate status (`foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);`) before performing any sensitive actions, not just within the initial `if` block. This helps prevent actions taken with possibly compromised credentials.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
                        foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if (X509_V_OK==foo)
                              
                                 
                                 //do stuff
                                 foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
                                 //do more stuff without the check.
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                                 
               
               ```
