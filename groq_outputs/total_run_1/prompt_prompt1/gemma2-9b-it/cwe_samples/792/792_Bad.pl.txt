VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The line `my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;` directly concatenates the username obtained from `GetUntrustedInput()` with a path string.  An attacker could provide a specially crafted username containing sequences like `..` (parent directory traversal) to access files and directories outside the intended `/home/user/` directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent users from entering malicious characters like `..`.  You should only allow valid directory names and restrict the path length to prevent going beyond the intended directory structure.
2. **Use a Safer Path Construction Method:**  Avoid directly concatenating user input with path components. Instead, consider using functions specifically designed for safe path handling, which often include input validation and escaping mechanisms.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;  
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
