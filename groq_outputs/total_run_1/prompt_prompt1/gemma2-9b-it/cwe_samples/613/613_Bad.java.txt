VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Session Timeout Configuration
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet sets the session timeout to -1, which indicates an infinite session duration. This can lead to security vulnerabilities like:

* **Session Fixation Attacks:** An attacker can potentially hijack a user's session due to its indefinite lifetime.

* **Resource Exhaustion:**  Prolonged active sessions can consume excessive resources, impacting server performance and availability.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 

* **Set a Reasonable Session Timeout:** Configure a finite session timeout value based on your application's requirements and security considerations. A common practice is to set a timeout of 30 minutes to an hour. For example, `<session-timeout>30</session-timeout>`.
* **Implement Session Expiration Handling:**  Ensure your application handles session expiration gracefully. For example, log out users automatically when their session expires and redirect them to a login page.
