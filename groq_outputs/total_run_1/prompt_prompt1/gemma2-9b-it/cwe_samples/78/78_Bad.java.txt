VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection
EXPLANATION: The code takes the value of the `SCRIPTNAME` system property and executes it using `System.exec()`. This opens the door to command injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `SCRIPTNAME` property to inject malicious commands that would be executed with the privileges of the running process.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never directly use `System.exec()` with user-supplied input.** This function is inherently dangerous when handling untrusted data.

* **Consider using a safer alternative like a dedicated process execution library** that provides better input sanitation and control over command execution. 
* **If you must use `System.exec()`, carefully sanitize and validate the input to ensure it only contains safe commands.**

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String script = System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME");
if (script != null)
  System.exec(script);
```
