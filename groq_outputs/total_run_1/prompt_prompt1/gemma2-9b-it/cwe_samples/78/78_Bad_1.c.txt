VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection because it concatenates user input from `argv[1]` with a fixed string `cat` and then executes the resulting command using `system()`. An attacker could provide malicious input to `argv[1]` that could modify the intended command, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary system commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Use safer alternatives to `system()`:**  Functions like `subprocess` in Python or the `execvp()` family in C offer better control over command execution and mitigate the risk of injection.
*   **Sanitize user input:**  Validate and sanitize the input from `argv[1]` before using it in the command. This might involve:
    *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow specific, expected characters or patterns.
    *   **Escaping:** Properly escape special characters in the input to prevent their interpretation as shell commands.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char cat[] = "cat ";
    char *command;
    size_t commandLength;
    commandLength = strlen(cat) + strlen(argv[1]) + 1;
    command = (char *) malloc(commandLength);
    strncpy(command, cat, commandLength);
    strncat(command, argv[1], (commandLength - strlen(cat)) );
    system(command);
    return (0);
}
```
