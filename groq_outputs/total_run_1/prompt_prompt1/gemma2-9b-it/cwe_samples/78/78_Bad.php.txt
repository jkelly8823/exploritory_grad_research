VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code is vulnerable to command injection.  The `system()` function is directly executing a command constructed by concatenating user-supplied input (`$_POST["user"]`) with other strings. An attacker could manipulate the `user` input to execute arbitrary commands on the server. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Sanitize user input:**  Never directly use user input in system commands. Validate and sanitize the input to remove potentially harmful characters or patterns. 
- **Use a safer alternative:** Instead of `system()`, consider using functions like `exec()` or `shell_exec()` with proper input escaping or a dedicated library for executing commands securely.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$userName = $_POST["user"];
$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;
system($command);
```
