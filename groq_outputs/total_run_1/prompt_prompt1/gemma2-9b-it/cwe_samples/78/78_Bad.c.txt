VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to command injection because it directly concatenates user-supplied input from `argv[1]` into a system command using `strcat` and then executes it with `system`. An attacker could provide malicious input as the first argument (`argv[1]`), which could lead to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions. 

For example, an attacker could provide the following input:

```
; rm -rf /
```

This would result in the command `/usr/bin/cat ; rm -rf /` being executed, potentially deleting all files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:**  Never directly concatenate user input into system commands. Carefully validate and sanitize the input to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not include potentially harmful commands.

2. **Use safer alternatives:**  Consider using safer alternatives to `system()` like `exec()` or `fork()` and `execvp()` that limit the potential for command injection.  Additionally, explore using libraries designed for secure command execution, which often incorporate input sanitization and other security measures.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
  strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
  system(cmd);
}
```
