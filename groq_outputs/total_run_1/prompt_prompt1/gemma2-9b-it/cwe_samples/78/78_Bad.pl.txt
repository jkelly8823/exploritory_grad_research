VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses the `param('name')` variable directly within a system command (`"$nslookup $name|"`). This opens the door for command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could provide a malicious input for the 'name' parameter, which would be executed by the `nslookup` command, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:** Never directly incorporate user-supplied data into system commands. Use a dedicated function to sanitize and validate the input before using it in any command-line arguments. 
* **Use Parameterized Queries:** If possible, use parameterized queries or database libraries that automatically escape user input to prevent SQL injection.
* **Minimize Privileges:** Run the web application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from a successful attack.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
use CGI qw(:standard);
$name = param('name');
$nslookup = "/path/to/nslookup";
print header;
if (open($fh, "$nslookup $name|")) {
  while (<$fh>) {
    print escapeHTML($_);
    print "<br>\n";
  }
  close($fh);
}
```
