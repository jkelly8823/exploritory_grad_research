VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the line `WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));`.  Here's why:

* **Untrusted Input:** `numWidgets` is obtained from `GetUntrustedSizeValue()`, meaning its value could be manipulated by an attacker.
* **Potential Overflow:** If an attacker can cause `numWidgets` to exceed the maximum allowed value (`MAX_NUM_WIDGETS`),  `malloc()` will allocate more memory than intended.  Writing beyond the bounds of the allocated memory (in this case, `WidgetList`) can lead to a buffer overflow.

* **Consequences:** A buffer overflow could overwrite critical data structures, potentially crashing the program or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate `numWidgets`:** Before allocating memory, rigorously validate `numWidgets` to ensure it falls within a safe range (less than `MAX_NUM_WIDGETS`). Implement checks to handle cases where `numWidgets` is 0 or too large.
2. **Use Safe Memory Allocation Functions:** Consider using safer memory allocation functions that provide bounds checking, such as `calloc()` or libraries designed to prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;
numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {ExitError("Incorrect number of widgets requested!");}WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));printf("WidgetList ptr=%p\n", WidgetList);for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();}WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;showWidgets(WidgetList);
               );
               
               ```
