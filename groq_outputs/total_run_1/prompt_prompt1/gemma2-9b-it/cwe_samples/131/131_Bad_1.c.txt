VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to buffer overflows. 

1. **Uninitialized Variable:** The variable `num_imgs` is declared but not explicitly initialized before being used in the `malloc` call. This means its value is undefined, potentially leading to an inaccurate allocation size.

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation with Unverified Size:** The code uses `malloc()` to allocate a block of memory based on `sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs`. If `num_imgs` is larger than intended (e.g., due to an attacker manipulating the input), this could result in:
   - **Buffer Overflow:**  The allocated memory might be insufficient to hold all the `img_t` structures. This can lead to data being written beyond the allocated bounds, potentially overwriting critical program variables or even executing arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. **Initialize `num_imgs`:** Ensure `num_imgs` is initialized with a valid value before the `malloc` call. This could involve:
     - Using a default value (e.g., 0 if no initial values are known).
     - Reading the value from a trusted source,  considering input validation to prevent malicious manipulation.
  2. **Input Validation:**  If `num_imgs` is obtained from an external source (e.g., user input), implement robust input validation to ensure it falls within a reasonable range.

  ```c
  // Example with input validation (assuming a safe maximum size)
  #define MAX_IMG_COUNT 1000 

  img_t table_ptr; 
  int num_imgs;

  num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
  if (num_imgs > MAX_IMG_COUNT) {
      // handle error: num_imgs exceeds maximum allowed value
      return; 
  }

  table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs); 
  /* ... rest of your code ... */

  ``` 



ORIGINAL CODE:


                  img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/int num_imgs;...num_imgs = get_num_imgs();table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);...
