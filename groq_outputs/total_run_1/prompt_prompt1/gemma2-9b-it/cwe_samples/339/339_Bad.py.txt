VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Random Number Generation

EXPLANATION:  The code uses `os.urandom(2)` to obtain 2 bytes of randomness which is then used to seed the PRNG (`random.seed(a=seed)`). While using `os.urandom` is good practice for generating cryptographically secure random bytes, the seed size of 2 bytes (16 bits) is extremely small for a cryptographic PRNG.

A seed this small can lead to predictability in the generated random numbers, effectively compromising the security of the generated key (`key = random.getrandbits(128)`). An attacker could potentially predict the key after observing a small number of random outputs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*  Increase the size of the random seed. A minimum of 128-bits is recommended for cryptographic purposes.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
# getting 2 bytes of randomness for the seeding the PRNG 
seed = os.urandom(2)
random.seed(a=seed)
key = random.getrandbits(128)  
```
