VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded password
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly compares the input password with the hardcoded string "Mew!". This makes the system highly vulnerable to attacks as anyone knowing the password can gain access. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*  Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
*  Never compare passwords directly with a hardcoded value. 
*  Implement proper input validation to ensure passwords meet complexity requirements.



ORIGINAL CODE:
               int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
               if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
               
               printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
               }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
               }
