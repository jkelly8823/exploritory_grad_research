VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper input validation 
EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses string comparison to verify if a user is an administrator. It does not sanitize or validate the input password. An attacker could potentially bypass this check by using a similar-looking password or exploiting potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Implement a hashing algorithm to store and compare passwords.
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
-  Consider using a more robust authentication method.


ORIGINAL_CODE:
```
               int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}
             
             ```
