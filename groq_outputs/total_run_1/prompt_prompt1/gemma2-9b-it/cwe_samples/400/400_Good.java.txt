VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to unbounded thread creation.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_CONNECTIONS)` to create a thread pool. However, the `acceptConnections` method continuously accepts new connections and spawns a new thread for each connection. If an attacker successfully floods the server with a large number of connection requests, the thread pool can become overwhelmed. This can lead to the server exhausting its resources and becoming unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Limit the number of connections:** Implement a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent connections. You could use a queue to handle incoming connections and limit the number of threads that can access the queue simultaneously.
2. **Use a more sophisticated thread pool:** Consider using a thread pool with dynamic resizing capabilities, such as `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`. This allows the thread pool to automatically adjust the number of threads based on the incoming workload, mitigating the risk of resource exhaustion.
3. **Rate limiting:** Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests an attacker can make within a specific timeframe.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  public static final int SERVER_PORT = 4444;public static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10;...
                     public void acceptConnections() {
                     
                        try {ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(SERVER_PORT);int counter = 0;boolean hasConnections = true;while (hasConnections) {hasConnections = checkForMoreConnections();Socket client = serverSocket.accept();Thread t = new Thread(new ClientSocketThread(client));t.setName(client.getInetAddress().getHostName() + ":" + counter++);ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_CONNECTIONS);pool.execute(t);}serverSocket.close();
                           
                           } catch (IOException ex) {...}
                     }
               
            
            
            ```
