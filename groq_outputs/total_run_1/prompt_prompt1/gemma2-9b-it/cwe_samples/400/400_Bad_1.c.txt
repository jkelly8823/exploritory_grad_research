VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow in `writeDataFromSocketToFile` function

EXPLANATION:

The provided code snippet exhibits a vulnerability to buffer overflows due to the use of unvalidated input sizes when handling data received from the socket. Specifically:
* **Line 1:**  The function `getNextMessage` is not defined in the given context. Without knowing its implementation, it's impossible to confirm if it performs any input validation or size checks on the received data.
* **Lines 5, 7, 9, 12:** The `char filename[FILENAME_SIZE]` and `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` arrays have fixed sizes (determined by  `FILENAME_SIZE` and `BUFFER_SIZE`, respectively). If the data received through `getNextMessage` exceeds these fixed sizes, it will lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate Input Sizes:** Implement robust input validation within the `getNextMessage` function. Ensure that the received data size does not exceed the allocated buffers (`filename` and `buffer`).

2. **Consider Dynamic Allocation:** Instead of using fixed-size buffers, explore using dynamically allocated memory (e.g., with `malloc`)  to handle varying data lengths. Remember to `free` the allocated memory when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. If using `malloc`, make sure to always specify a size before `malloc`. 
3. **Use Safe String Handling:** When working with strings received from potentially untrusted sources, use safe string handling functions like `strncpy` or `snprintf`  to prevent buffer overflows. These functions allow you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, limiting the potential for overflow. 


ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  int writeDataFromSocketToFile(char *host, int port){
                        
                           char filename[FILENAME_SIZE];char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];int socket = openSocketConnection(host, port);
                           if (socket < 0) {printf("Unable to open socket connection");return(FAIL);}if (getNextMessage(socket, filename, FILENAME_SIZE) > 0) {
                              if (openFileToWrite(filename) > 0) {
                                    while (getNextMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0){if (!(writeToFile(buffer) > 0))break;
                                       }
                                 }closeFile();
                           }closeSocket(socket);
                     }
