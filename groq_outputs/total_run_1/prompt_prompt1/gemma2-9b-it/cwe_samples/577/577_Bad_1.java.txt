VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Infinite loop vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: The code creates an infinite loop in the constructor `StockSymbolBean()`. The `while(listening)` loop runs indefinitely because the `listening` flag is always set to `true`. This can lead to resource exhaustion and make the application unresponsive.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1.  **Introduce a mechanism to exit the loop:**  Add a condition to the `while` loop that checks for a specific event or flag indicating when to stop listening for connections.

2.  **Use a separate thread for listening:**  Instead of running the `accept()` call within the main constructor loop, create a dedicated thread to handle incoming connections. This will allow the main thread to perform other tasks and prevent resource starvation.
3.  **Implement timeout mechanisms:**  Set a timeout for the `accept()` call to avoid indefinite waiting for client connections.



ORIGINAL CODE:

                  @Statelesspublic class StockSymbolBean extends Thread implements StockSymbolRemote {
                        
                           ServerSocket serverSocket = null;Socket clientSocket = null;boolean listening = false;
                           public StockSymbolBean() {
                              try {serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT);} catch (IOException ex) {...}
                                 listening = true;while(listening) {start();}
                           }
                           public String getStockSymbol(String name) {...}
                           public BigDecimal getStockValue(String symbol) {...}
                           public void run() {try {clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();} catch (IOException e) {...}...}
                        
                     }
               
               }
