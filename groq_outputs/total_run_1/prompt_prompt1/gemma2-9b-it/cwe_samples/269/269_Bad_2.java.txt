VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Authorization bypass vulnerability. 
EXPLANATION:
The code implements an authorization check based on the role of the `requestingUser`. However, the logic for handling roles is flawed. If the `requestingUser` is a `GUEST` or a `USER`, they are not authorized to reset a password.  Otherwise,  the `setPassword()` function is called without further checks. An attacker could potentially exploit this by manipulating the `requestingUser` role to bypass the intended authorization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Strengthen Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Ensure that only users with the appropriate role, such as `ADMIN` or `OPERATOR`, are allowed to access the `resetPassword()` function. 

2. **Explicitly Check for Authorized Roles:** Instead of relying on a default case, explicitly check for authorized roles within the `switch` statement and handle unauthorized access accordingly.

3. **Logging and Auditing:** Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track all password reset attempts and identify potential suspicious activity.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public enum Roles {ADMIN,OPERATOR,USER,GUEST}
                     public void resetPassword(User requestingUser, User user, String password ){
                        if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
                              switch(requestingUser.role){
                                    case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       case USER:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       default:setPassword(user,password);break;}
                                 }
                           
                           else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
                     }
               
               
               ```
