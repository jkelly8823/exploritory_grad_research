VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Incomplete switch statement
EXPLANATION: A switch statement requires all possible cases to be handled. In this code, the `roles` are `ADMIN`, `USER`, and `GUEST`.  The code only handles `GUEST` and `default`, leaving `ADMIN` and `USER` unhandled. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if an attacker can manipulate the `role` value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Add cases for `ADMIN` and `USER` roles within the `switch` statement. 
2. Ensure each case performs the appropriate actions based on the expected role permissions.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                  public enum Roles {ADMIN,USER,GUEST}
                     public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
                        if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
                              switch(requestingUser.role){
                                    case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       default:System.out.println(currentDebugState());break;
                                    
                                 }
                           }else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
                     }
   ```
