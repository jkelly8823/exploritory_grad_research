VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly constructs a file path using string concatenation without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the `configPath` variable by manipulating input data used to construct the file path.  When the application accesses this file, it could execute unintended commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use parameterized queries or a template engine:**  Instead of directly embedding user input into the file path, use parameterized queries or a template engine to separate the path components from the dynamic data. This prevents the direct execution of user-supplied content. 
* **Sanitize input:** If you must directly concatenate user input, sanitize it carefully to remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences. 
* **Validate input:** Enforce strict input validation rules to ensure that user-supplied data conforms to the expected format and does not contain malicious code.
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  public String configPath = new String("/etc/application/config.dat");
