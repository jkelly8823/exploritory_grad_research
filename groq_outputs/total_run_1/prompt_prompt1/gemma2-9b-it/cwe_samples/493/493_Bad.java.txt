VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) via URL Parameter Injection.

EXPLANATION:
The `LookupPrice("MyWidgetType")` call raises a concern. The method's input, "MyWidgetType," appears to be directly coming from a user-controlled source (likely a URL parameter). If an attacker can manipulate this input, they might be able to:

1. **Trigger unexpected function calls:**  If the `LookupPrice` method performs dynamic lookups based on the input, malicious input could lead it to execute unintended code.

2. **Execute arbitrary code:**  A vulnerable implementation of `LookupPrice` might allow crafted input to be interpreted as code, resulting in remote code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize user input:** Before using "MyWidgetType" in `LookupPrice`, sanitize it rigorously. This involves:
    * Removing potentially dangerous characters.
    * Validating against a predefined set of acceptable values.
* **Use prepared statements or parameter binding:** Where possible, use database queries or function calls that parameterize input, preventing direct code interpretation of user data.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                  public final class WidgetData extends Applet {
public float price;
...
public WidgetData(...) {
this.price = LookupPrice("MyWidgetType");
}
  }
 }
 
                  ```
