VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Comparing String objects with == can lead to incorrect results.
EXPLANATION: 
In Java, the `==` operator checks for object identity, meaning it compares if two variables refer to the same object in memory. When you create String objects using `new String()`, each object is allocated a new memory location. Therefore, even if the string values are identical ("Hello"),  `str1` and `str2` will not refer to the same object, and `str1 == str2` will evaluate to false.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the `.equals()` method to compare the string values, as it performs a content comparison rather than an identity comparison. Change line 3 from: 
`if (str1 == str2)` to 
`if (str1.equals(str2))`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String str1 = new String("Hello");String str2 = new String("Hello");if (str1 == str2) {System.out.println("str1 == str2");}
               
               
               
               ```
