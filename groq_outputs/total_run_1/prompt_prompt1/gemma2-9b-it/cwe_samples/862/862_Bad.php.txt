VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code snippet demonstrates responsible practices to avoid SQL injection.

EXPLANATION: 
The code utilizes prepared statements to sanitize user input. This technique separates the SQL query structure from the user-provided data, effectively preventing malicious code injection. The `:name` placeholder ensures that the `$name` variable is treated as data rather than part of the SQL command, mitigating the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The snippet is already well-structured and avoids known vulnerabilities. Consider further securing the application by:
*   Enforcing input validation: Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types and formats. 
*   Using parameterized queries: The snippet already achieves this, which is excellent.
*   Implementing error handling: Handle database errors gracefully to prevent leakage of sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```php
                  function runEmployeeQuery($dbName, $name){mysql_select_db($dbName,$globalDbHandle) or die("Could not open Database".$dbName);
                        //Use a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89
                        $preparedStatement = $globalDbHandle->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');$preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name));return $preparedStatement->fetchAll();}
                     /.../
                     
                     $employeeRecord = runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB',$_GET['EmployeeName']);
]);
               
               ```
