VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any apparent vulnerabilities. It defines a class `DoubleDead` with two private methods, `doTweedledee` and `doTweedledumb`. These methods call each other recursively, creating an infinite loop. While this is not a security vulnerability, it leads to a runtime error (Stack Overflow) as the program attempts to call the methods endlessly. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- To fix this issue, introduce a termination condition within the recursive calls. For example, you could add a counter that limits the number of recursive calls or a flag to break the loop when a certain condition is met.
ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
public class DoubleDead {private void doTweedledee() {doTweedledumb();}private void doTweedledumb() {doTweedledee();}public static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println("running DoubleDead");}}
```
