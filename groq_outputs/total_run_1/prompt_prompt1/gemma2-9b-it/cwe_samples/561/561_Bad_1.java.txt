EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet is a simple class definition with a getter method. There are no immediately apparent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or buffer overflows. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
While no vulnerabilities are found, consider these best practices for writing secure code:

* **Input Validation:**  Always validate user input before using it in queries or code execution.
* **Output Encoding:**  Encode user-supplied data before displaying it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Secure Configuration:** Ensure your application is configured securely, including using strong passwords and limiting access to sensitive resources.
* **Stay Updated:**  Keep your software libraries and frameworks up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
