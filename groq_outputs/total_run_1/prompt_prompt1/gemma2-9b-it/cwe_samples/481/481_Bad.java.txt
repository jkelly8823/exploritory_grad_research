VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:	Assignment Instead of Comparison

EXPLANATION:
The line `if (isValid = true)` uses the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`. This means the code is attempting to assign the value `true` to the `isValid` variable instead of checking if it's equal to `true`. As a result, the condition will always evaluate to `true`, bypassing the `else` block regardless of the initial value of `isValid`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the line `if (isValid = true)` to `if (isValid == true)` to correctly compare the value of `isValid` with `true`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public void checkValid(boolean isValid) {if (isValid = true) {System.out.println("Performing processing");doSomethingImportant();}else {System.out.println("Not Valid, do not perform processing");return;}}
               
```
