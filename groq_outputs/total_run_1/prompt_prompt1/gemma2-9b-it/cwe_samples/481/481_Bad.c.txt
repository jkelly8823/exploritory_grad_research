VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Inequality Operator Error
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a single equals sign (`=`) in the `if` statement condition, which is an assignment operator, not a comparison operator.  This means the code is always assigning the value `100` to the `value` variable instead of checking if they are equal. Consequently, the `if` condition will always evaluate to true, leading to unexpected behavior.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the single equals sign (`=`) with a double equals sign (`==`) in the `if` statement condition to perform a comparison:
 
```c
int isValid(int value) {
  if (value == 100) { 
    printf("Value is valid\n");
    return(1);
  }
  printf("Value is not valid\n");
  return(0);
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}


                 
          }
