VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Assignment instead of comparison
EXPLANATION: 
The `isValid` function uses a single equal sign (`=`) inside the `if` statement, which is an assignment operator, not a comparison operator. This means `value = 100` attempts to assign the value 100 to `value` rather than comparing it.  

The intended logic likely should have been to use the comparison operator `==`: `if (value == 100)`.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Change line 2 from:

```csharp
if (value=100) 
```

to:

```csharp
if (value == 100)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
                  bool isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {Console.WriteLine("Value is valid.");return true;}Console.WriteLine("Value is not valid.");return false;}
               
               ```
