VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a function call `$db->authenticateUser($username, $password)` which doesn't properly sanitize the user input (`$username` and `$password`).  This leaves the application vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input for these parameters, potentially allowing them to:

* Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
* Modify or delete existing data.
* Execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Parameterize Queries:** Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL query, use parameterized queries (prepared statements). This separates the SQL code from data, preventing attackers from manipulating the query structure.

* **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user input before using it in any SQL query. This involves:
    * Checking data types.
    * Removing potentially harmful characters.
    * Escaping special characters that have SQL meaning.
    
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  <?phpinclude('database.inc');$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);$db->authenticateUser($username, $password);?>
               );?> 
```
