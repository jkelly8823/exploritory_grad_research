VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet stores database credentials (`dbName` and `dbPassword`) directly within the PHP code. This is a serious security vulnerability because these credentials are exposed in plain text, making them easily accessible to anyone who has access to the source code. An attacker could then use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never store sensitive information like database credentials directly in your code.** 
* **Use environment variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables and access them securely within your application.
* **Configuration Files:** Store sensitive information in a separate configuration file that is not part of the version control system.  Ensure this file has appropriate access controls.
* **Secret Management Tools:** For more robust solutions, consider using dedicated secret management tools to handle and protect your sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
```
