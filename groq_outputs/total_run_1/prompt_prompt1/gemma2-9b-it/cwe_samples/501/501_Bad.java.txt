VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses `request.getParameter("usrname")` to retrieve the user's input without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the "usrname" parameter, which would then be stored in the session and potentially executed by other users.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize user input before using it. This can involve:
    - Encoding the user input to prevent it from being interpreted as code.
    - Using a whitelist to only allow specific, safe characters.
    - Validating the input format to ensure it matches the expected structure.
```java
usrname = sanitizeInput(request.getParameter("usrname")); 
                   
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  usrname = request.getParameter("usrname");if (session.getAttribute(ATTR_USR) == null) {session.setAttribute(ATTR_USR, usrname);}
