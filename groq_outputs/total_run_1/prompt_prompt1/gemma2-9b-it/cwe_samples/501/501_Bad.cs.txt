## Code Vulnerability Analysis

**VULNERABLE:** YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 1
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:** Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
**EXPLANATION:** 
The code directly assigns the value of `request.Item("usrname")` to the `usrname` variable without any sanitization or validation. If a malicious user submits an input containing JavaScript code into the "usrname" parameter, it could be executed by the server and potentially result in an XSS attack.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Before using the `request.Item("usrname")` value, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript code. You can use HTML encoding libraries or regular expressions for this purpose.

2. **Validate User Input:**  Implement input validation to ensure that the "usrname" value conforms to expected patterns and data types. This can help prevent unexpected or malicious input from being processed.
3. **Use Prepared Statements:**  If you are interacting with a database, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  

**ORIGINAL CODE:** 
 ```
                  usrname = request.Item("usrname");if (session.Item(ATTR_USR) == null) {session.Add(ATTR_USR, usrname);} 
               
 ```
