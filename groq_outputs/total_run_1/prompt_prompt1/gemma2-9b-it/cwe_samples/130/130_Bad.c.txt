VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0)` reads data from the socket into the `buffer` without validating the length of the received data. If the incoming data exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`, it will overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate Input Length:**  Before copying data from `buffer` to `message`, ensure that the length of the received data (`getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE)`) does not exceed `BUFFER_SIZE`.
2. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking within the loop that copies data from `msg->msgBody` to `message`. Ensure `index` does not go beyond `msg->msgLength`.
3. **Use Safe Buffer Handling:** Consider using safer buffer handling techniques such as:
   * Dynamically allocating the `buffer` based on the expected data length.
   * Implementing a secure string manipulation library.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```c++
                  int processMessageFromSocket(int socket) {
                        int success;
                           char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];char message[MESSAGE_SIZE];
                           
                           // get message from socket and store into buffer
                           
                           
                           //Ignoring possibliity that buffer > BUFFER_SIZE
                           if (getMessage(socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE) > 0) {
                              
                                 
                                 // place contents of the buffer into message structure
                                 ExMessage *msg = recastBuffer(buffer);
                                 
                                 // copy message body into string for processing
                                 int index;for (index = 0; index < msg->msgLength; index++) {message[index] = msg->msgBody[index];}message[index] = '\0';
                                 
                                 // process message
                                 success = processMessage(message);
                           }return success;
                     }
               
               ```
