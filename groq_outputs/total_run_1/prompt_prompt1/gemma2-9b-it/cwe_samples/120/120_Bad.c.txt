VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of `scanf("%s", last_name);` without a size limit. The `%s` format specifier reads input until it encounters a whitespace character, which could potentially exceed the allocated size of the `last_name` buffer (20 characters).  

This can lead to data overwriting adjacent memory locations, potentially causing program crashes or allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a size-limited input function:** Replace `scanf("%s", last_name);` with `scanf("%19s", last_name);` to limit the input to 19 characters. This leaves one character for the null terminator.

2. **Validate user input:** After reading the input, check its length. If it exceeds the maximum allowed size, handle it appropriately (e.g., display an error message or reject the input).


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
 char last_name[20];
 printf ("Enter your last name: ");
 scanf ("%s", last_name););
```
