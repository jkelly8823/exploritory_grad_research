VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `strcpy(buf, string)` without checking the length of the `string` input. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the `string` is longer than 24 characters (the size of the `buf` array).  

When a buffer overflow occurs, data written beyond the allocated memory space of the buffer can overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can corrupt data, crash the program, or even be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* Use a safer string copying function like `strncpy()` which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy. For example:

```c
strncpy(buf, string, sizeof(buf) - 1);
buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0'; 
```

* Sanitize user input to ensure it meets the expected length requirements before processing it.
* Consider using bounds-checking libraries or tools to help prevent buffer overflows.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
```c
void manipulate_string(char * string){char buf[24];strcpy(buf, string);...}
               ...}
```
