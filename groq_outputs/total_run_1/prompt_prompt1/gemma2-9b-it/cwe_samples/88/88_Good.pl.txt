VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Regular expression vulnerability - Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)
EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` could be susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A malicious actor could craft a large, malformed input string that exceeds system resources and crashes the application when the regex is evaluated. This happens because the regex doesn't have any limitations on the length of the input string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation**:  Implement stringent input validation before using the regular expression. Check the maximum allowed length of the `$name` variable and reject any input exceeding this limit.

2. **Sanitize Input**:  Sanitize the input string to remove potentially harmful characters that could be used to exploit the regex.

3. **Regex Optimization**: Carefully consider if a more restrictive regex can be used. For example, adding a limit on the number of characters allowed within `[\w\-]` could mitigate the DoS risk.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) ... 
```
