VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code utilizes the `system()` function to execute a command constructed dynamically from the user-provided input (`$fname`).  The `system()` function executes commands directly from the shell, making it vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could provide a malicious filename containing shell commands that would be executed, potentially allowing them to take control of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Avoid `system()` for User-Input Handling**:  The `system()` function is inherently insecure when dealing with user-supplied data. Consider safer alternatives for executing external commands:
    * **`exec`:** Provides more control over the command environment.
    * **`IO::Pipe`:** Allows for safe and controlled interaction with external processes.
    * **Specialized Modules:** For specific tasks, use modules designed for secure command execution, such as `File::Find`, `IPC::Run`, or `Term::ReadKey`.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries (if applicable):**

 If the intended use case involves executing database queries or interacting with a database, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

3. **Sanitize User Input:**  Always sanitize user input before using it in any dynamic commands. For this example, you would need to thoroughly validate and escape special characters in the `$fname` before constructing the command.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
do_listing($arg);



sub do_listing {

  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {

    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;

  }
  # build command
  my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
  system($cmd);

}

sub validate_name {

  my($name) = @_;
  if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {

    return(1);

  }
  else {

    return(0);

  }

}
  
```
