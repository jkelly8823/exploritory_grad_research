VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-11, 15-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Loop Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The code contains a potential infinite loop vulnerability within the `do...while` loop. The loop condition `password_tries == 0` will always be true if `password_tries` is initialized to 0, causing the loop to run indefinitely. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Modify the Loop Condition:**  Change the loop condition to a more appropriate value than `password_tries == 0`.  
   
2. **Add a Termination Condition:**  Introduce a separate condition within the loop to ensure it eventually terminates. This could be based on a successful password match or a maximum number of attempts. 
   
   



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
           static nonvolatile password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
           do
	   
             while (password_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
             password_ok = 0;
             for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++)
	     
               if (GetPasswordByte() == stored_password([i])
	       
		 password_ok |= 1; // Power consumption is different here
	       
               else
	       
		 password_ok |= 0; // than from here
	       
	     
             end
             if (password_ok > 0)
	     
               password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
               break_to_Ok_to_proceed
	     
             password_tries--;
	   
           while (true)
           // Password OK
 OK
          
          
```
