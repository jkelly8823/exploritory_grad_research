VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8/10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper use of the assignment operator (<)
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses the less than operator (`<`) for assignment instead of the assignment operator (`=`). This will result in a syntax error and the code will not compile.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the lines 8 and 10 from `q<4'b0000;` and `q<a;` to `q <= 4'b0000;` and `q <= a;` respectively.  In SystemVerilog, the `<=` operator is used for synchronous assignment within an `always` block.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```systemverilog
module pipo(clk,rst,a,q);
	   
  input clk,rst;
  input[3:0]a;
  output[3:0]q;
  reg[3:0]q;
  
  always@(posedge clk,posedge rst)
  begin
	     
    if (rst==1'b1)
       
      q<4'b0000;
       
    else
       
      q<a;
       
	     
  end
   
endmodule
```
