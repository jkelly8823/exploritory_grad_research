VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Overly permissive bucket ACLs

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet utilizes `gsutil` to modify the Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket named `BUCKET_NAME`.  It grants access to:

*  `allUsers` (Line 1): Allows any user on the internet to access the bucket.
*  `allAuthenticatedUsers` (Line 2): Allows any user who has authenticated with Google to access the bucket.

Granting access to `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers` without further restrictions can pose a severe security risk. It exposes the bucket's contents to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to data breaches, malicious modifications, or other harmful actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Restrict Access using Specific Groups or Users:**  Instead of granting access to broad user categories, identify the specific Google accounts or user groups that require access to the bucket. Use `gsutil` commands with specific user or group identifiers within the `-u` flag.

2. **Apply Principle of Least Privilege:**  Follow the principle of least privilege. Grant only the minimal level of access necessary for users or groups to perform their required tasks. Consider using different IAM roles with granular permissions to control access to specific objects within the bucket.

3. **Implement Conditional Access Policies:**  Enhance security by leveraging Google Cloud's conditional access policies. These policies can restrict access based on factors like user location, device posture, or authentication method.

4. **Regularly Review IAM Permissions:** Conduct periodic reviews of your bucket's IAM permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and haven't been inadvertently granted to unauthorized entities.
