VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Exposure of Blob Storage

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the Azure CLI to update a storage account setting `allow-blob-public-access` to `true`. This configuration allows any user on the internet to access blobs (files) in the storage account without authentication. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Do not expose blobs publicly without strict access control.** 
- **Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to define granular permissions for who can access specific blobs and perform operations on them.**
- **Utilize Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for temporary, limited-time access to specific blobs for authorized users or applications.**
- **Leverage encryption both at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data stored in the blob storage.**

ORIGINAL CODE:

```bash
               az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access true
``` 




This configuration represents a significant security risk as it grants open access to your storage data.
