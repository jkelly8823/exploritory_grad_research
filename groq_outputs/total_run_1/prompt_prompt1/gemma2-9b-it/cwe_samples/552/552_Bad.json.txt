VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for overly permissive bucket access.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet grants the "allUsers" group the `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader` role for a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This allows all users on the internet to read from the bucket.  This could be a significant security risk if the bucket contains sensitive or confidential information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Restrict access to specific groups or users:** Instead of granting access to "allUsers", define a more limited set of groups or individual users who require read access to the bucket.
* **Use more restrictive roles:** Consider using roles with more granular permissions than `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader`. For example, instead of allowing read access to all objects, specify only the types of objects or prefixes that require access.
* **Enable Google Cloud IAM auditing:** Regularly review access logs to identify any potential abuse or unauthorized activity.
