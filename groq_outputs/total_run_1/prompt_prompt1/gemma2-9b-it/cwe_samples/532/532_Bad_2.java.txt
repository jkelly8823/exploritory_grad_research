VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly embeds user-supplied values (`username` and `accountNumber`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft malicious input that alters the intended query, potentially allowing them to access unauthorized data, modify existing data, or execute arbitrary commands on the database.

For example, an attacker could provide a username like `' OR 1=1 --` which would change the query to:
`SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner = '' OR 1=1 --` AND accountID = `

Since `1=1` is always true, this would bypass the `WHERE` clause and return all account information.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries to separate SQL code from user input. This involves using placeholders in the query string and passing the user-supplied values as separate arguments. Most database drivers provide mechanisms for creating and executing parameterized queries.

2. Implement robust input validation to ensure that user-supplied values meet expected formats and do not contain potentially harmful characters.

3. Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to abstract away the database interaction and provide built-in security mechanisms.



ORIGINAL CODE:


                  public BankAccount getUserBankAccount(String username, String accountNumber) {
                        BankAccount userAccount = null;String query = null;try {if (isAuthorizedUser(username)) {query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE owner = "+ username + " AND accountID = " + accountNumber;DatabaseManager dbManager = new DatabaseManager();Connection conn = dbManager.getConnection();Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();ResultSet queryResult = stmt.executeQuery(query);userAccount = (BankAccount)queryResult.getObject(accountNumber);}} catch (SQLException ex) {String logMessage = "Unable to retrieve account information from database,\nquery: " + query;Logger.getLogger(BankManager.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, logMessage, ex);}return userAccount;
                     }
