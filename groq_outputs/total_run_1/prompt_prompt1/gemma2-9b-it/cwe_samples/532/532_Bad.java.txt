VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) 

EXPLANATION: 
The code directly appends user input (`usernme`) and (`ccn`) to log messages without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to an IDOR vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate these input values to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions. For example, if the `usernme` input is modified to represent a different user, the log message could inadvertently reveal data belonging to that user. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in log messages or any other context. This involves removing potentially harmful characters, validating data types, and escaping special characters. 
2. **Use Placeholders in Log Messages:** Instead of directly embedding user data into log messages, use parameterized queries or placeholders.

Let me know if you'd like to see an example of how to implement these recommendations in the code! 



ORIGINAL CODE:
        logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);
               
);
