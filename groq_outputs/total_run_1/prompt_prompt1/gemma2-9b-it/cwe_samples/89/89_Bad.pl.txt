VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection 
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user input into a SQL query without proper sanitization.  The `$name` variable, obtained from `getUserInput()`, could contain malicious SQL code that, when inserted into the query, could compromise the database. An attacker could craft input to manipulate the query, potentially deleting, adding, or modifying data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use parameterized queries:** Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL query, use parameterized queries. This separates the SQL code from the data, preventing malicious code from being interpreted as part of the query.

   Example using PDO:

   ```php
   $stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO last_names (user_key, name) VALUES (:userKey, :name)");
   $stmt->bindParam(':userKey', $userKey, PDO::PARAM_INT);
   $stmt->bindParam(':name', $name, PDO::PARAM_STR);
   $stmt->execute();
   ```

2. **Sanitize user input:** Even with parameterized queries, it's good practice to sanitize user input to prevent other types of vulnerabilities. Validate and escape any special characters in `$name` before using it.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$userKey = getUserID();
$name = getUserInput();

# ensure only letters, hyphens and apostrophe are allowed
$name = allowList($name, "^a-zA-z'-$");
$query = "INSERT INTO last_names VALUES('$userKey', '$name')";
```
