VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection 
EXPLANATION:  The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts the value of the `$_COOKIE["mid"]` variable into the SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the value of the `mid` cookie to inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This involves separating the SQL code from the data inputs. A safe alternative could look like this:

```php
$id = intval($_COOKIE["mid"]);
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("i", $id);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
```
* Sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries. Escaping special characters like single quotes and backslashes can help mitigate the risk of injection, but it's not a foolproof solution. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
                  $id = intval($_COOKIE["mid"]);mysql_query("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'");
               
               ```
