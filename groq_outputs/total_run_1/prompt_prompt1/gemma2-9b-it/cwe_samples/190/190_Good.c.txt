VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow

EXPLANATION:
The variable `quarterSold` is declared as `long`, capable of holding large values. However, the sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` (which are presumably integers) could potentially exceed the maximum value a `long` can hold. This could lead to an integer overflow, resulting in unexpected and potentially malicious behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Consider using a larger data type:** If the potential sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` consistently exceeds the maximum value of `long`, consider using a larger data type like `BigInteger` to prevent overflow.
2. **Perform overflow checks:** Before performing the calculation `quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold`, check if the sum of the individual values is within the bounds of the `long` data type. If it exceeds the bounds, handle the overflow appropriately.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  ...float calculateRevenueForQuarter(long quarterSold) {...}
                     int determineFirstQuarterRevenue() {
                        ...
                           // Calculate quarterly total
                           long quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;
                           
                           // Calculate the total revenue for the quarter
                           quarterRevenue = calculateRevenueForQuarter(quarterSold);
                           ...
                     }
