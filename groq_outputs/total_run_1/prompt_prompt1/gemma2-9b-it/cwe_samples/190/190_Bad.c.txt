VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:

The code allocates memory using `malloc` based on the value read from `get_num_imgs()`. If `get_num_imgs()` returns a value larger than anticipated, it can lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could potentially manipulate the return value of `get_num_imgs()` to exceed the intended memory allocation, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially causing program crashes or allowing for malicious code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Input Validation:** 
   -  Implement robust input validation for the value returned by `get_num_imgs()`. Ensure the returned value is within a safe and expected range.
2. **Bounds Checking:** 
    - Add bounds checks during memory allocation to prevent writing beyond the allocated memory region. 
3. **Secure Memory Management:** Consider using safer memory allocation functions that might offer bounds checking or other mitigations against buffer overflows, although these might not be applicable to all scenarios.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs(); 
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
...
```
