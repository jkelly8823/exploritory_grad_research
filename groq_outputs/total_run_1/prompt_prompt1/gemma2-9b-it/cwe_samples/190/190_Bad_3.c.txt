VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10,11,12,13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The code calculates `quarterSold` by adding three `short` integer values. The `short` data type typically has a limited range (e.g., -32,768 to 32,767). If the sum of `JanSold`, `FebSold`, and `MarSold` exceeds this range, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use a larger data type:** Change the `short` data type for `quarterSold` to an `int` or `long`. These data types have a wider range that can accommodate potentially larger sales figures.
   
2. **Check for overflow:** Before performing the addition, add a check to ensure that the individual month's sales values are within a safe range. If any value is too large, you can handle it appropriately (e.g., log an error, truncate the value, or use a different approach).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
                  #define JAN 1#define FEB 2#define MAR 3
                     short getMonthlySales(int month) {...}
                     float calculateRevenueForQuarter(short quarterSold) {...}
                     int determineFirstQuarterRevenue() {
                        
                           
                           // Variable for sales revenue for the quarter
                           float quarterRevenue = 0.0f;
                           short JanSold = getMonthlySales(JAN); /* Get sales in January */short FebSold = getMonthlySales(FEB); /* Get sales in February */short MarSold = getMonthlySales(MAR); /* Get sales in March */
                           
                           // Calculate quarterly total
                           short quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;
                           
                           // Calculate the total revenue for the quarter
                           quarterRevenue = calculateRevenueForQuarter(quarterSold);
                           saveFirstQuarterRevenue(quarterRevenue);
                           return 0;
                     }
}               
               ```
