VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow and Potential Dangling Pointer
EXPLANATION:
The `contains_char` function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The `strcpy(str, "Search Me!")` line copies the string "Search Me!" into the dynamically allocated buffer `str`.  If `str` is not large enough to hold the entire string plus the null terminator, it will overflow.

Additionally, the code potentially uses a dangling pointer in the loop and even when freeing the string. These pointers might point to invalid memory locations, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Limit `strcpy` To Safe Lengths:**
   - Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`. `strncpy` allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing buffer overflows.

   ```c
   strncpy(str, "Search Me!", sizeof(str) - 1); 
   str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null termination
   ```

2. **Address Dangling Pointers:**
   -  The loop condition `while ( *str != NULL )` should be changed to `while ( *str ) ` because `NULL` is a special value that compares to zero.

   -  **Outside of the `while` loop (line 20), `free(str)` is called right after the string is potentially modified. The pointer may be pointing to an invalid memory location after modification of the same string.  ** 

   -   **The use of `str = str + 1;` is problematic because it treats a dynamic string as an array of integers. This may lead to undefined behavior.  **


   - **Revised Logic:**
     ```c
     int contains_char(char c) {
        char *str = (char*)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));
        strncpy(str, "Search Me!", sizeof(str) - 1); 
        str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0';

        for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
           if (str[i] == c) {
               free(str);
               return SUCCESS;
           }
        }

        free(str);
        return FAILURE;
     }
     ```



ORIGINAL CODE:



```c
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)
int contains_char(char c){
char *str;
str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
while( *str != NULL){
if( *str == c ){
              /* matched char, free string and return success */
              free(str);
              return SUCCESS;
}
/* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
str = str + 1;
}
/* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
free(str);
return FAILURE;
}
```
