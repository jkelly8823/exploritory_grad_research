VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 12, 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential buffer overflow and memory leak.
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking. 

* **Buffer Overflow**: `strcpy(str, "Search Me!")` copies the string "Search Me!" into the buffer `str`. If the string "Search Me!" happens to be longer than the allocated space for `str` (20 bytes), it will result in a buffer overflow, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to program crashes or security exploits.

* **Memory Leak**: In every iteration of the loop, `free(str)` is called within the `if` statement and outside the loop. This means  memory allocated with `malloc` might not always be freed if the character `c` isn't found. Additionally, the unconditional call to `free(str)` at the end of the function  further exacerbates this issue as the memory might essentially become leaked if the function returned prior to cleaning up.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds-checked String Copying**: Instead of `strcpy`, use a safer string copying function like `strncpy` that allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing buffer overflows.   

2. **Memory Management**: Free the allocated memory only once at the end of the function. This eliminates the possibility of double-free errors and memory leaks. Handle cases where `c` is not found and free the memory in those scenarios as well.



ORIGINAL CODE: 


 ```c
  #define SUCCESS (1)
 #define FAILURE (0)
  int cointains_char(char c){
 char *str;int i = 0;
 str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
 strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
 while( i < strlen(str) ){
   if( str[i] == c ){
     /* matched char, free string and return success */
     free(str);
     return SUCCESS;
   }
   /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
   i = i + 1;
 }
 /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
 free(str);return FAILURE;
 }
