VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
NA
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a basic bounds check for an array index. It verifies that the `index` value falls within the valid range of indices for the array, which is from 0 to `len` (exclusive). This check helps prevent out-of-bounds array access, a common vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code snippet is already performing a necessary bounds check.  Consider adding additional robustness depending on the context:
*   **Input Validation:** If `index` comes from external input, sanitize it to ensure it's a valid integer and within the expected range. 
*   **Zero-Based Indexing:**  Be mindful of whether your array uses zero-based or one-based indexing. The code assumes zero-based indexing.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
// check that the array index is within the correct
// range of values for the array
if (index >= 0 && index < len) {
  ...
}
```
