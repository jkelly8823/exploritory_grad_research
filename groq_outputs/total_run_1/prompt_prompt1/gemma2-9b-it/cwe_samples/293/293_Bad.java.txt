VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability through untrusted Referer Header

EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses the referer header (`request.getHeader("referer")`) without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could manipulate the Referer header in their request to inject malicious scripts. If a malicious user manages to send a request with a crafted Referer header, it could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code on the server or steal sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize the Referer Header:** Use a library or a custom function to properly sanitize the Referer header before using it in any conditional logic. This involves removing any potentially harmful characters or code snippets.

2. **Validate the Referer:** Always validate the Referer header against a predefined list of trusted domains or patterns. Instead of a strict equality check (`equals`), use a whitelist approach to ensure that only expected referrers are allowed.

3. **Consider Using HTTPS:** Enforced HTTPS will help protect against some types of header manipulation attacks.

 ORIGINAL CODE:
 ```java
 boolean processConnectionRequest(HttpServletRequest request){
 String referer = request.getHeader("referer");
 String trustedReferer = "http://www.example.com/";
 if(referer.equals(trustedReferer)){
 openPrivilegedConnection(request);
 return true;
 }else{
 sendPrivilegeError(request);
 return false;
 }
 }
 ```
