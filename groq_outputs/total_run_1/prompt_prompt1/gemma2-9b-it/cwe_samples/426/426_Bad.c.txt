VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `sprintf(cmd, "ls -l %480s", DIR);` line is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The format string `%480s` can be exploited to write beyond the bounds of the `cmd` buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory. An attacker could craft a specially-formatted `DIR` variable that includes ".." characters, allowing them to access files outside the intended `/restricted/directory` .

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use Safe String Functions:** Replace `sprintf` with a safer alternative like `snprintf`, which limits the number of characters written to the buffer.

2. **Validate Input:**  Sanitize and validate the `DIR` variable before using it in the command. Ensure it only contains characters allowed within the restricted directory. 3. **Avoid Unnecessary Privilege Escalation:**  Only raise privileges if absolutely necessary for the task. In this example, if the command  `ls -l`  requires elevated privileges, consider alternative methods that don't involve manipulating user input. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #define DIR "/restricted/directory"
                     char cmd[500];sprintf(cmd, "ls -l %480s", DIR);
                     /* Raise privileges to those needed for accessing DIR. */
                     
                     RaisePrivileges(...);system(cmd);DropPrivileges(...);...
