VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line Numbers where  `System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");` appears 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:   Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
The use of `Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");`  directly executes the command "make" without any sanitization of user input. This opens the door for command injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the input that triggers this command execution, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary system commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Avoid using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` directly:** This method is inherently risky. Consider safer alternatives like using a dedicated process manager or framework that provides better input validation and control. 

2. **Sanitize input:** If you must use `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, meticulously sanitize any user-supplied input before constructing the command string.  Escape special characters and only allow a whitelist of permitted commands. 

3. **Use a build system:**  For build processes, leverage a robust build system like Maven, Gradle, or Ant. These tools provide secure mechanisms for managing dependencies and executing build steps.
