VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: The code constructs a system command using user input (`$userName`) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system command, potentially leading to privilege escalation or system compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Do not directly incorporate user input into system commands.**
* **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements** to execute SQL queries safely.
* **Sanitize user input thoroughly** to remove potentially harmful characters before using it in commands.
* **Implement a whitelist** of allowed commands or arguments.
* **Consider using a safer alternative to `system()`** such as `exec()` or `proc_open()` with more control over input and output.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
//assume getCurrentUser() returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric (avoiding CWE-78)
$userName = getCurrentUser();$command = 'ps aux | grep ' . $userName;system($command);
```
