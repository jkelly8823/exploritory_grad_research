VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  LDAP Injection (Potential)
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses the `ACCOUNT_ID` variable to construct a cookie object. If `ACCOUNT_ID` is not properly sanitized or validated, it could allow an attacker to inject LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) code into the cookie. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or system resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize user input:** Ensure that the `acctID` value passed to the `ACCOUNT_ID` variable is properly sanitized before being used in the cookie. This involves removing or escaping any potentially harmful characters that could be used for LDAP injection. Use a whitelist approach to only allow valid characters.
2. **Validate user input:** Implement input validation to ensure that `acctID` conforms to the expected format and range. This can help prevent unexpected values from being injected.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID);response.addCookie(c);
               
            );
               
            
               
            ```
