VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code snippet exposes database credentials (username and password) directly in the configuration string. This practice is extremely insecure as it allows anyone with access to the code to readily obtain sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

*   **Use Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables and retrieve them from the application at runtime. This separates sensitive data from the code itself.
*   **Configuration Files (Securely):** If using configuration files, encrypt sensitive data using industry-standard encryption methods. 
*   **Secret Management Systems:**  For production environments, implement a dedicated secret management system to securely store and retrieve credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  ...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
