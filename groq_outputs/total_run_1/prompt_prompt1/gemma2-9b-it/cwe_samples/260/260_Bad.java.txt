VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive Information Exposure
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores the user name ("secretUsername") and password ("secretPassword") in plain text variables. This practice exposes these credentials in the code itself, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the code repository or system. This is a severe security vulnerability as it allows attackers to directly obtain the credentials and gain unauthorized access to the LDAP server.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* **Never store sensitive information like usernames and passwords in plain text within your code.** 
* **Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store and retrieve sensitive data.**  This way, credentials are not embedded directly in the code and are more protected.
* **Consider using hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 to securely store passwords.**  This ensures that even if a breach occurs, the leaked data will not be usable without the corresponding salt. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
webapp.ldap.username = secretUsername
webapp.ldap.password = secretPassword 
```
