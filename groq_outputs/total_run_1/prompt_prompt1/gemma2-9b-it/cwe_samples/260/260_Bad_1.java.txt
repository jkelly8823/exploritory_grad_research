VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet reveals hardcoded usernames and passwords within a properties file. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive information directly in the source code. Any attacker who gains access to the file can readily obtain these credentials, compromising the application's security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Store Credentials Securely:**
   - Utilize environment variables to hold sensitive information like usernames and passwords. This keeps credentials out of the codebase and allows for centralized management.
   - Employ a dedicated secrets management system for storing and retrieving sensitive data securely.

2. **Encrypt Sensitive Data:**
   - Encrypt the contents of the properties file using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This adds an extra layer of protection, making it significantly harder for attackers to decipher the credentials even if they gain access to the file.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
   - Grant the application only the necessary permissions to execute its functions. Avoid storing overly privileged credentials within the application's environment if possible.
