VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to command injection due to the direct execution of user-provided input (`$args`) without proper sanitization. The `split(/ /, $cmd, 2)` function splits the command string based on a single whitespace, effectively separating the operator and arguments. However, the `$args` variable is then directly used in functions like `ExecuteBan` and `ExecuteSay`. An attacker could craft malicious input containing shell commands disguised as arguments, which would be executed when passing them to these functions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:**  Never directly execute user-supplied input as commands.  Sanitize and validate input to ensure it only contains allowed characters and formats.
* **Use Parameterized Queries:** If your application interacts with a database or other data store, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* **Limit Function Capabilities:** If possible, restrict the functions (`ExecuteBan`, `ExecuteSay`, etc.) to only perform safe operations and avoid allowing arbitrary command execution. 
* **Escape Special Characters:** Before executing any user input, escape any special characters that could be interpreted as commands.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
                  $inputString = readLineFromFileHandle($serverFH);
                     
                     # generate an array of strings separated by the "|" character.
                     @commands = split(/\|/, $inputString);
                     foreach $cmd (@commands) {
                        
                        # separate the operator from its arguments based on a single whitespace
                        ($operator, $args) = split(/ /, $cmd, 2);
                        $args = UrlDecode($args);if ($operator eq "BAN") {ExecuteBan($args);}elsif ($operator eq "SAY") {ExecuteSay($args);}}
               }}
               
               ```
