VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly outputs the value of the `email` parameter from the request without any sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into this parameter, which would then be executed in the user's browser. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the `email` parameter before using it in the HTML output. This can be done using a library that escapes HTML characters or by using a template engine that handles escaping automatically. 
   
ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  <% String email = request.getParameter("email"); %>...Email Address: <%= email %>
