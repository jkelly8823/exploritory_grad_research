VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,6,8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Resource Leak - The FileInputStream is not always guaranteed to be closed due to a potential `Exception` within `processPFile`.

EXPLANATION:

Lines 4 and 6 declare and initialize a `FileInputStream` but the `fis.close()` statement on line 8 might not always execute.  If an `Exception` is thrown inside the `processPFile` method, the `FileInputStream` will remain open, leading to a resource leak. A resource leak occurs when a resource (like a file) is no longer needed but remains open, consuming system resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use try-with-resources:**

   This is the recommended way to ensure resources are properly closed regardless of exceptions.

   ```java
    try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName)) {
        fis.read(byteArray); 
        processPFile(userName, byteArray);
    }
    ```

2. **Handle exceptions specifically:** Within the `try-with-resources` block, catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully. Make sure to close the `FileInputStream` in the `finally` block of your exception handler. 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
FileInputStream fis;
byte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];
for (Iterator i = users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
    String userName = (String) i.next();
    String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + "/" + userName;
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName);
    fis.read(byteArray); // the file is always 1k bytes
    fis.close();
    processPFile(userName,byteArray);   
}
```
