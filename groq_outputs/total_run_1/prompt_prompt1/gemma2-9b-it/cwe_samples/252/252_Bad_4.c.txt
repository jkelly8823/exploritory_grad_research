EXPLANATION: 

The provided code snippet demonstrates a correct usage of a mutex. 

* **Mutex Acquisition:**  `pthread_mutex_lock(mutex)` is used to acquire the mutex, ensuring that only one thread can enter the protected block of code at a time.

* **Critical Section:** The section within the curly braces `/* access shared resource */` represents the critical section â€“ the code that accesses the shared resource. 

* **Mutex Release:** `pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)` is used to release the mutex, allowing other waiting threads to acquire it.

This pattern properly synchronizes access to the shared resource, preventing race conditions and data corruption.
