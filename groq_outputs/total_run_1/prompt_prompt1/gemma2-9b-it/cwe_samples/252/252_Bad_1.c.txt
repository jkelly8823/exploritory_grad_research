VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The line `memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));` potentially leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability. 

Here's why:

* **Undefined Behavior of `returnChunkSize`:** The function `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` is supposed to return the size of usable memory. However, the provided code snippet doesn't show its implementation. If it doesn't handle invalid input properly or returns unexpected values, it could lead to a buffer size that is too small.
* **Subtracting 1:** Subtracting 1 from the result of `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` makes the situation even more dangerous. It shrinks the allocated buffer size, increasing the risk of writing beyond its bounds.

* **memcpy:** The `memcpy` function copies data from a source buffer (`srcBuf`) to a destination buffer (`destBuf`) without any bounds checking. If the size passed to `memcpy` is larger than the available space in `destBuf`, it will overwrite memory beyond the intended buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize `returnChunkSize`:** Ensure that `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` always returns a valid size and handles potential errors gracefully. Consider adding input validation and error handling to prevent unexpected results.

2. **Bounds Checking:**  Instead of directly using `returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1`, compare the size returned by `returnChunkSize` with the size of `srcBuf` and copy only the necessary amount of data.

3. **Safe Memory Copying:**  Use safer functions like `strncpy` or `strlcpy` that limit the number of bytes copied and prevent buffer overflows.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  int returnChunkSize(void *) {
                        
                           
                           /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
                           
                           
                           * else, return -1 to indicate an error
                           
                           
                           */
                           ...
                     }int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
               
               ...}   
```
