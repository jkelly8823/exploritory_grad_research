VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line containing ".key_i(256'h24e6fa2254c2ff632a41b...)"
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Secret Key
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet reveals a hardcoded secret key within the `hmac` module. Specifically, the line  " .key_i(256'h24e6fa2254c2ff632a41b...)"  defines the key using a literal value. 

Hardcoding secrets directly into the code is a severe vulnerability. It exposes the sensitive key to anyone who has access to the source code, making it trivial for attackers to decipher and potentially compromise the system.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Do not hardcode secrets:**  Never embed cryptographic keys directly into your code.  
2.  **Key Management:** Implement a secure key management system. This could involve:
    *   Storing keys in an external vault or keystore.
    *   Using environment variables to load keys at runtime.
    *   Employing secrets management tools designed for secure handling of sensitive data.
    *   Implementing key rotation policies to regularly update keys.
3.  **Consider Obfuscation:** While not a replacement for proper key management, you can consider code obfuscation techniques to make extracting the key more difficult. However, remember that strong obfuscation is often complex and may not provide complete protection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
module dmi_jtag(...)(...);
...

PassChkValid: begin
if(hashValid) begin
    
    if(exp_hash == pass_hash) begin
        
        pass_check = 1'b1;
        
    end else begin
        
        pass_check = 1'b0;
        
    end
    state_d = Idle;
    
end else begin
state_d = PassChkValid;
end

end

hmac hmac(
...
    .key_i(256'h24e6fa2254c2ff632a41b...),
   ...
);
