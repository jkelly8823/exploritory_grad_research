VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Timing Side-Channel Attack
EXPLANATION: 

The provided code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability to timing side-channel attacks specifically related to the update of the `hmac_key_reg` register. 

Here's why:

* **Sensitive Data Update:** The `hmac_key_reg` holds the cryptographic key used in the HMAC computation.  
* **Conditional Update:** The key is loaded from the input `hmac_key_i` only when `hmac_patch_en` is high. 
* **Timing Dependency:** The `always_ff` block updates `hmac_key_reg` on the rising edge of `tck_i` or falling edge of `trst_ni`.  An attacker could measure the time it takes for this update to occur.
* **Key Disclosure:** Since the update is conditional on `hmac_patch_en`, an attacker could infer information about bits of the `hmac_key_i` by observing the timing variations.

**Example:**  If an attacker knows `hmac_patch_en` will be asserted only for certain key values, they might be able to deduce bits of the key by analyzing the timing of the register update.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Remove Timing-Dependent Dependencies:**  Explore ways to make the key update deterministic and independent of external triggers like `hmac_patch_en`. Consider using a separate, dedicated mechanism for key loading that doesn't rely on sensitive timing.

2. **Protect Key Update:** Implement measures to mitigate timing side-channel attacks during the key update process. This could include:
   * **Constant-Time Execution:**  Ensure that the logic for updating `hmac_key_reg` is executed in a constant time regardless of the value being loaded.
   * **Blinding Techniques:** Introduce randomness into the key update process to make it more difficult for an attacker to correlate timing variations with specific key bits.

3. **Secure Key Handling:** Follow best practices for cryptographic key management. Consider techniques like key rotation, secure storage, and access control.
