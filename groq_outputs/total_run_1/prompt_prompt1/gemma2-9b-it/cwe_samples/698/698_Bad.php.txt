VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The vulnerability lies in the use of `echo` to display user-supplied data (`$requestingIP`) directly within the HTML output. Without proper sanitization or encoding, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `$requestingIP` variable, potentially leading to XSS attacks. When a user visits the page, their browser would execute these scripts, compromising the site's security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** 
   - Before echoing the `$requestingIP`, use appropriate sanitization techniques to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters. 
   - Consider using a dedicated HTML escaping function provided by your PHP framework or library.

2. **Validate Input:** 
   - Validate the format and content of the `$requestingIP` to ensure it meets your expected criteria for a valid IP address. This helps prevent injection attempts.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
                     
```
