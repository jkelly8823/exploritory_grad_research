VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for DNS Spoofing Attack
EXPLANATION: 

The code directly parses and uses the `RemoteIpAddress` value to perform a DNS lookup (`Dns.GetHostByAddress`). This introduces a vulnerability to DNS spoofing attacks.  An attacker controlling the network could potentially manipulate the `RemoteIpAddress` value, causing the code to resolve to a malicious hostname instead of "trustme.com", even if the user believes they are communicating with the legitimate site.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate the hostname through multiple trusted sources:** Instead of solely relying on the `RemoteIpAddress`, consider obtaining the hostname through a secure channel, like TLS/SSL, or perform multiple DNS lookups against different authoritative name servers. This will help mitigate the risk of resolving to a spoofed address.

2. **Implement a whitelist of trusted hosts:** Maintain a list of allowed hostnames and only trust connections if the resolved hostname is present in this whitelist. This adds an extra layer of security by explicitly defining which hosts are acceptable.

3. **Employ input sanitization:** Sanitize the `RemoteIpAddress` input to ensure it conforms to a valid IP address format, reducing the possibility of malicious injection attempts. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
IPAddress hostIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse(RemoteIpAddress);
IPHostEntry hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(hostIPAddress);
if (hostInfo.HostName.EndsWith("trustme.com")) 
{
trusted = true;
}
```
