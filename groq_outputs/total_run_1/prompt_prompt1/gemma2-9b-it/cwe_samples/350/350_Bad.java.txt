VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Remote Address Spoofing
EXPLANATION: 
The code blindly trusts the `request.getRemoteAddr()` value to determine if a client's IP address belongs to a trusted domain. An attacker could easily spoof their IP address to appear as if they are coming from "trustme.com", bypassing intended security checks. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Don't solely rely on IP addresses:** IP addresses can be spoofed, making them unreliable for security decisions.
* **Implement proper authentication:**  Use secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth or JWT to verify user identity and trust, instead of relying solely on IP addresses.
* **Whitelist IPs:** Instead of a blacklisting approach, create a whitelist of trusted IP addresses or ranges.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {trusted = true;}
               
               ;}
               
               
               
               
```
