VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Checked Locking 
EXPLANATION:
A double checked locking construction has been implemented improperly. In this case, the `if (helper == null)` check is performed both outside and inside the synchronized block. This can lead to a situation where two threads both enter the synchronized block, even though only one helper instance is needed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Correct the Double Checked Locking:**

    *   Remove the redundant check inside the synchronized block. 

Here's the corrected version:

    ```java
    if (helper == null) {
      synchronized (this) {
        if (helper == null) { // Only check again inside the synchronized block
          helper = new Helper();
        }
      }
    }
    return helper;
    ```

2.  **Consider Alternatives:**  While double-checked locking is often used,  consider alternatives like using `lazyHolder` idiom in Java 5+ for thread-safety.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
if (helper == null) {
    synchronized (this) {if (helper == null) {helper = new Helper();}}
}return helper; 
```
