EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet demonstrates the correct usage of a mutex for protecting shared resources in a multi-threaded environment. 

It acquires the mutex lock using `pthread_mutex_lock(mutex)`, accesses the shared resource (represented by the comment `/* access shared resource */`), and then releases the lock using `pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)`. This ensures that only one thread can access the critical section (the code within the locked block) at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
The code appears to be secure and properly handles mutex usage. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
  pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
 
  /* access shared resource */
 
  
  pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```
