VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Incorrect Usage of pthread_mutex_unlock: The `return` statement should be placed after accessing the shared resource. Currently, it is before, possibly leading to a resource leak if an exception occurs.
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to acquire a lock using `pthread_mutex_lock` and then access a shared resource. However, the placement of the `return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)` statement is problematic. If an exception occurs within the code block between `pthread_mutex_lock` and `return pthread_mutex_unlock`, the mutex will not be unlocked, leading to a deadlock or resource contention issue.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Move the `return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex)` statement to after the section where the shared resource is accessed:

```c
int f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    int result;
    result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
    if (0 != result) 
        return result;

    /* access shared resource */

    return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
  int f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
        int result;
           result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;
           
           
           /* access shared resource */
           
           
           return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
     } 
```
