VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Resource Handling 
EXPLANATION:
The code lacks proper error handling and resource management when dealing with the file pointer (`$logfile`).  Here's why:

* **Potential for Resource Leaks:** If the `flock()` call fails, the `$logfile` resource remains open due to the `fclose($logFile);` statement being executed regardless of the lock outcome. This can lead to resource leaks if the application encounters repeated failures to acquire the lock. 
* **Unhandled Exceptions:** The code doesn't include any mechanisms to handle potential errors that could occur during file operations (e.g., permission issues, disk space problems). 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks or similar mechanisms. This allows you to gracefully handle potential issues during file opening, writing, and closing.

2. **Resource Management:** Be sure to close the file pointer (`$logfile`) even if errors occur. You can enclose the critical file operations within a `try...finally` block to ensure the file is closed, regardless of success or failure.

3. **Logging:** Consider using a dedicated logging library that handles resource management and potentially provides more informative logging errors.



ORIGINAL CODE:


 ```php
function writeToLog($message){
 $logfile = fopen("logFile.log", "a");
 //attempt to get logfile lock
 if (flock($logfile, LOCK_EX)) {
     fwrite($logfile,$message);
     // unlock logfile
     flock($logfile, LOCK_UN);
 }else {
     print "Could not obtain lock on logFile.log, message not recorded\n";
 }
 fclose($logFile);

 }
 ```
