VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Shallow Copy Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code creates a copy of the `Book` object using `book.clone()`. However, `clone()` performs a shallow copy, meaning that nested objects within the `Book` object are not copied. This can lead to issues where changes to the nested objects in `bookSold` also affect the original `book` object in the inventory.

For example, if a `Book` object contains a list of authors, modifying the list in `bookSold` will also modify the same list in the original `book`.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Deep Copy:** Instead of using `clone()`, implement a deep copy of the `Book` object. This will recursively copy all nested objects, ensuring that modifications to the copy do not affect the original.

   You can achieve this by defining a custom deep copy method in the `Book` class or using a third-party library designed for deep copying.

2. **Immutable Objects:** Consider making the `Book` object immutable or using immutable data structures for nested objects. This prevents accidental modifications, eliminating the risk of unintended side effects.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
...public void updateSalesAndInventoryForBookSold(String bookISBN) {
                        
                           
                           // Get book object from inventory using ISBN
                           Book book = inventory.getBookWithISBN(bookISBN);
                           // Create copy of book object to make sure contents are not changed
                           Book bookSold = (Book) book.clone();
                           // update sales information for book sold
                           sales.updateSalesInformation(bookSold);
                           // update inventory
                           inventory.updateInventory(book);
                     }...
               
...
```
