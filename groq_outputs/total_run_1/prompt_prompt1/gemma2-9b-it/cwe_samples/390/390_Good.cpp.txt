VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory leak
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for the `buffer` using `new[]`, but doesn't deallocate it using `delete[]` when it's no longer needed. This leads to a memory leak, where the allocated memory is not returned to the operating system, resulting in a gradual consumption of system resources over time.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Deallocate the memory:**  Add a `delete[] buffer;` statement after the `return buffer;` line in the `readFile` function. This will release the allocated memory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
                  char* readFile (char *filename) {
                        try {
                              // open input fileifstream infile;infile.open(filename);
                                 if (!infile.is_open()) {throw "Unable to open file " + filename;}
                                 // get length of fileinfile.seekg (0, ios::end);int length = infile.tellg();infile.seekg (0, ios::beg);
                                 // allocate memorychar *buffer = new char [length];
                                 // read data from fileinfile.read (buffer,length);
                                 if (!infile.good()) {throw "Unable to read from file " + filename;}infile.close();
                                 return buffer;
                           }catch (char *str) {printf("Error: %s \n", str);infile.close();throw str;}catch (...) {printf("Error occurred trying to read from file \n");infile.close();throw;}
                     }
               }
               
            ```
