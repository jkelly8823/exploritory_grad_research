VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory Leak
EXPLANATION: 
The code allocates memory for a buffer to store the contents of the file using `new char [length]`. However, it doesn't have a corresponding `delete` operation to free this memory when it's no longer needed.  If the file reading operation is successful, the `buffer` will hold data, but that memory won't be released.  This leads to a memory leak, where the program consumes more and more memory over time as it reads files, eventually potentially crashing or running out of resources.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Add Memory Deallocation:**  Insert a `delete[] buffer;` statement immediately before the `return buffer;` statement within the `try` block. This ensures the dynamically allocated memory is released when the function returns.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  char* readfile (char *filename) {
                        try {
                              // open input fileifstream infile;infile.open(filename);
                                 if (!infile.is_open()) {throw "Unable to open file " + filename;}
                                 // get length of fileinfile.seekg (0, ios::end);int length = infile.tellg();infile.seekg (0, ios::beg);
                                 // allocate memorychar *buffer = new char [length];
                                 // read data from fileinfile.read (buffer,length);
                                 if (!infile.good()) {throw "Unable to read from file " + filename;}
                                 infile.close();
                                 return buffer;
                           }catch (...) {/* bug: insert code to handle this later */}
                     }
}
