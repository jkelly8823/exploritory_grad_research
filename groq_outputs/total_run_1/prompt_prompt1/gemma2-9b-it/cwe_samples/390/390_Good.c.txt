VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing Memory Deallocation
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using `malloc` but doesn't deallocate it using `free`. This leads to a memory leak, where the allocated memory is not returned to the system, potentially causing problems as the program runs and consumes more and more memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a `free(foo);` statement before the closing brace of the code block to deallocate the memory pointed to by `foo`. This ensures that the memory is released back to the system when it's no longer needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
foo=malloc(sizeof(char)); //the next line checks to see if malloc failedif (foo==NULL) {printf("Malloc failed to allocate memory resources");return -1;}
```
