VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Dynamic Intent Injection Vulnerability 

EXPLANATION: 
The code registers a broadcast receiver using  `registerReceiver` with a hardcoded action string `"com.example.URLHandler.openURL"`.  An attacker could potentially send a malicious broadcast with the same action and data, allowing them to execute unintended code within the `onReceive` method. 


RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a whitelisting approach**:  Instead of directly comparing the action string, create a set of allowed actions and only process intents that match those values.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
                 IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.URLHandler.openURL");
                 MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
                 registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
                 ...  
```
