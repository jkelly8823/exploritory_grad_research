VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet directly constructs a command by retrieving the value of the `cmd` system property using `System.getProperty("cmd")` and then trimming it with `.trim()`.  If `cmd` is controlled by an untrusted source (e.g., user input), this could lead to command injection. An attacker could manipulate the `cmd` system property to inject malicious commands that would be executed with the privileges of the current process.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Sanitize user input:** Never directly use user-provided input to construct commands. Validate and sanitize the input to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters. Consider using a dedicated library for command construction that handles escaping and sanitization automatically.
- **Employ parameterized queries:** If the command involves interacting with a database, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  
- **Restrict command execution:**  Explore implementing a whitelist of allowed commands to limit what can be executed. Only execute commands that are explicitly permitted and trusted.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String cmd = System.getProperty("cmd");cmd = cmd.trim();
               
                    ```
