VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: LDAP Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a user-supplied input (`address`) directly within a LDAP search filter. This allows an attacker to craft malicious LDAP queries that could potentially reveal sensitive information, compromise the system, or perform other unauthorized actions.

Specifically, the line `String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address;` concatenates the user input `address` into the LDAP search filter without any sanitization or validation. This means an attacker could provide an input like:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

This would modify the LDAP query to bypass intended access controls, allowing the attacker to retrieve all data. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Escape User Input:** Sanitize the `address` input to escape special characters that could be used to construct malicious LDAP queries. Use an appropriate LDAP escaping mechanism.

- **Use Prepared Statements:** Consider using prepared statements for LDAP searches, where user input is treated as parameters rather than directly embedded in the query.

- **Validate Input:**  Implement input validation to ensure that the `address` input conforms to a predefined format and does not contain potentially harmful characters.

ORIGINAL CODE:



```java
context = new InitialDirContext(env);String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address;NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);
               
               
               
```
