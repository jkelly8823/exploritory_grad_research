VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code utilizes prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates good security practices by using a prepared statement to execute the SQL query. Prepared statements allow parameterized queries, meaning user-supplied data is treated as data, not executable code. This prevents SQL injection attacks, which occur when malicious users inject arbitrary SQL code into data inputs, potentially compromising the database.

By using the `:name` placeholder and binding the `$name` variable to it using `$preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name))`, the code ensures that the `$name` value is treated as literal text within the SQL query, effectively mitigating the risk of SQL injection. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code is already secure against SQL injection. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  function runEmployeeQuery($dbName, $name){mysql_select_db($dbName,$globalDbHandle) or die("Could not open Database".$dbName);
                        //Use a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89
                        $preparedStatement = $globalDbHandle->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');$preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name));return $preparedStatement->fetchAll();}
                     /.../
                     
                     $employeeRecord = runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB',$_GET['EmployeeName']);
']);
               
 ```
