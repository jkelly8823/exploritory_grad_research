VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection 
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a vulnerability where user-supplied input (`$q->param('id')`) is directly used in the `DisplayPrivateMessage` function without any sanitization or validation. This could lead to SQL injection attacks.

An attacker could manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to: 

- Access unauthorized data
- Modify existing data
- Execute arbitrary commands on the database server

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize and Validate Input:** Before using the `$id` parameter, sanitize and validate it to ensure it only contains expected values and does not include any potentially harmful SQL code. You can use parameterized queries or prepared statements to achieve this effectively. 

2. **Escape Special Characters:** If you cannot avoid directly embedding the `$id` parameter in SQL queries, you should escape any special characters (like quotes, semicolons, etc.) that could be used for injection. However, this is generally considered less secure than parameterized queries.

3. **input validation rules:**
   - Ensure that the 'id' parameter is numeric. 
   - Define a maximum length for the 'id' parameter to prevent overly long inputs that could exhaust resources or be used for other attacks.
