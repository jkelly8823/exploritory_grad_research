VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unsecured transmission of sensitive data.

EXPLANATION: 
The code sends a broadcast intent containing the username and password in plain text. This exposes the sensitive user credentials to any malicious applications or processes that are listening for this broadcast. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Don't send sensitive data in plain text.**  Avoid including usernames and passwords directly in intents, especially for broadcasts which are publicly accessible.
* **Use secure mechanisms:** 
    * **Encapsulation:** Store sensitive data securely within a custom object and only transmit the object itself. 
    * **Encryption:** Encrypt the username and password before sending them. Decrypt them only on the receiving end.
* **Limit broadcast access:** If a broadcast intent is necessary, consider using a permission system to restrict access to legitimate recipients.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction("com.example.CreateUser");intent.putExtra("Username", uname_string);intent.putExtra("Password", pw_string);sendBroadcast(intent);
               
);
               
```
