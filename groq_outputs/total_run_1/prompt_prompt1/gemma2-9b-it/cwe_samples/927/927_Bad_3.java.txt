VULNERABLE: YES 
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential vulnerability due to sending a broadcast without proper filtering.
EXPLANATION: 
The code sends a broadcast intent with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` set. While this flag allows other apps to read the URI specified in the intent, it doesn't restrict which applications can receive and respond to this broadcast. An attacker could potentially create a malicious app that intercepts this broadcast, gaining unauthorized access to the user's data at the `file_uri`. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a `Context` parameter for `sendBroadcast`**: Instead of using a global `sendBroadcast`, consider passing a `Context` parameter to the method that needs to send the broadcast. This allows for more fine-grained control over which receivers can access the broadcast.
* **Restrict permissions**: Review the permissions declared in your app's manifest and ensure that they align with the data being accessed. Avoid granting unnecessary permissions.
* **Utilize Intent Filters**: Implement specific Intent Filters for your broadcast receivers to ensure that only trusted apps can respond to this particular broadcast.
* **Consider a more secure alternative**: For sensitive data, explore more secure mechanisms like Content Providers or private APIs to share data with other apps.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction("com.example.BackupUserData");intent.setData(file_uri);intent.addFlags(FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);sendBroadcast(intent););
