VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code could be vulnerable to a directory traversal attack as it directly uses the user-provided `$filename` without proper sanitization.
EXPLANATION:
  - Lines 5 and 6 allow resolving symbolic links, making it possible for an attacker to provide a path that points to a directory outside the allowed access scope. 
  - Line 9 directly reads the content of a file using `file_get_contents()`, which might trigger issues if the provided filename leads to a  sensitive file or directory. An attacker could potentially craft a filename to access unexpected files or directories.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. **Sanitize User Input:** Always sanitize user-provided filenames before using them. Validate the filename against a whitelist of allowed directories and files.
   2. **Restrict Path Traversal:** Use a library or function dedicated to safe file handling and path manipulation. Avoid hardcoding file paths or using `readlink()` without strict validation.


ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
                  function readFile($filename){
                        $user = getCurrentUser();$realFile = $filename;
                           
                           //resolve file if its a symbolic link
                           if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
                           if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
                     }
               
               }
               
               
               
               
```
