VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:

The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack.  The `$dirName` variable is not thoroughly sanitized before being used to construct the `$newDir` path.  An attacker could provide a `$dirName` containing sequences like ".." which would allow them to access files and directories outside of the intended `users` directory.

For example, if `$userName` is "john" and an attacker provides `$dirName` as "/../etc/passwd", the script would create a directory `/../etc/passwd`, allowing access to the system's password file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate and sanitize user input:** Implement strict input validation to ensure that `$dirName` only contains allowed characters and doesn't contain potentially harmful sequences like "..".

2. **Use a whitelist approach:**  Define a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns for directory names. Only allow `$dirName` values that match the whitelist.

3. **Encode user input:** Encode the `$dirName` before using it in path construction. This prevents malicious characters from being interpreted as directory separators.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  function createDir($userName,$dirName){$userDir = '/users/'. $userName;if(strpos($dirName,'..') !== false){echo 'Directory name contains invalid sequence';return;}
                        //filter out '~' because other scripts identify user directories by this prefix
                        $dirName = str_replace('~','',$dirName);$newDir = $userDir . $dirName;mkdir($newDir, 0700);chown($newDir,$userName);}
);}
           
```
