VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The `run_ping` function directly embeds the user-supplied `ip` argument into the `ping` command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious commands into the `subprocess.call` execution. For example, an attacker might provide an IP address like `192.168.1.1;; rm -rf /` which, if not properly handled, could lead to the execution of the `rm -rf /` command, potentially deleting all files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use parameterized commands:**  Instead of directly concatenating the `ip` argument, use parameterized commands provided by libraries like `shlex` or `argparse`. This will prevent attackers from injecting malicious code.

* **Sanitize user input:** Carefully validate and sanitize any user-supplied input before using it in commands.  Remove potentially dangerous characters and ensure the input conforms to the expected format for IP addresses. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
  import subprocess

  def validate_ip(ip: str):
    split_ip = ip.split('.')
    if len(split_ip) > 4 or len(split_ip) == 0:
      raise ValueError("Invalid IP length")

    for octet in split_ip:
      try:
        int(octet, 10)
      except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Cannot convert IP octet to int - {e}")

    # Returns original IP after ensuring no exceptions are raised
    return ip



  def run_ping(ip: str):
    validated = validate_ip(ip)
    # The ping command treats zero-prepended IP addresses as octal
    result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
    print(result)
```
