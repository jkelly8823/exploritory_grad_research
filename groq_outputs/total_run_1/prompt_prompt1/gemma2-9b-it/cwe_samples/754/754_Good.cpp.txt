VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for resource leaks (file handles)
EXPLANATION: 
The code does not explicitly handle file closing and may lead to resource leaks if errors occur during file writing. 

Here's why:

* **Missing `fclose` equivalent:** The `closeFile` function is used to close the file, but there's no error handling if `closeFile` returns `FAIL`. If an error occurs during closing, the file handle might remain open, leading to a resource leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Robust File Closing:** Ensure the file is closed properly even if errors occur during writing.

   ```c
   int outputStringToFile(char *output, char *filename) {
       int isOutput = SUCCESS;
       int fileDescriptor = openFileToWrite(filename); 
       if (fileDescriptor == FAIL) {
           printf("Unable to open file %s\n", filename);
           isOutput = FAIL;
       } else {
           int isWrite = writeToFile(output, fileDescriptor); // Pass the file descriptor
           if (isWrite == FAIL) {
               printf("Unable to write to file %s\n", filename);
               isOutput = FAIL;
           } else {
               int isClose = closeFile(fileDescriptor); // Ensure proper file closure
               if (isClose == FAIL) {
                   printf("Unable to close file %s\n", filename);
                   isOutput = FAIL;
               }
           }
       }
       return isOutput;
   }
   ```
2. **Error Handling:** Use a more descriptive error code (`FAIL`) instead of relying solely on `SUCCESS` and `FAIL`. Consider specific error codes to pinpoint issues more effectively.
3. **Logging:** For better debugging, consider adding logging statements to track file opening, writing, and closing operations, along with potential error messages.




ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  int outputStringToFile(char *output, char *filename) {
                        int isOutput = SUCCESS;
                           int isOpen = openFileToWrite(filename);if (isOpen == FAIL) {printf("Unable to open file %s", filename);isOutput = FAIL;}else {
                              int isWrite = writeToFile(output);if (isWrite == FAIL) {printf("Unable to write to file %s", filename);isOutput = FAIL;}
                                 int isClose = closeFile(filename);if (isClose == FAIL)isOutput = FAIL;
                              
                           }return isOutput;
                     }
               
}                
```
