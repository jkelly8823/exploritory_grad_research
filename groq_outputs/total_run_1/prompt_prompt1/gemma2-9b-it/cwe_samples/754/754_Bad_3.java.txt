VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Race Condition 
EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to clear the "os.name" system property and then retrieve its value. This introduces a potential race condition because another process or thread could modify the "os.name" property between the clearing and reading steps. 

If another process sets "os.name" to a different value after `System.clearProperty("os.name");` is executed but before `System.getProperty("os.name");` is executed, the code will incorrectly identify the operating system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use synchronization:** 
   Wrap the code that modifies and reads the "os.name" property within a synchronized block to ensure exclusive access and prevent race conditions.

* **Alternative approach:** Instead of relying on clearing and reading system properties, consider using a more robust method to determine the operating system, such as a dedicated library or a platform-specific check.  



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
System.clearProperty("os.name");...String os = System.getProperty("os.name");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase("Windows 95")) System.out.println("Not supported");
               
");
               
```
