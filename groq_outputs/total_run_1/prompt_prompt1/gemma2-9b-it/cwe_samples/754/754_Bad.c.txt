VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because `strcpy(cp_buf, buf)` does not check the length of the input received by `fgets(buf, 10, stdin)`. If the user enters more than 9 characters (remembering null termination), it will write past the bounds of the `cp_buf` array, potentially overwriting other memory and causing a crash or allowing malicious code execution. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
* Use a safer string copying function like `strncpy(cp_buf, buf, sizeof(cp_buf) - 1)`. This function limits the number of characters copied to the destination buffer, preventing buffer overflows.
* Validate the length of the input received by `fgets` before copying it to `cp_buf`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  char buf[10], cp_buf[10];
fgets(buf, 10, stdin);
strcpy(cp_buf, buf);
               
);
