VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Allowlisting of Incoming IDs with Fixed Value

EXPLANATION:

The code sets the `acl_oh_allowlist` to a fixed value (`32'h8312`) within an `always @*` block. This means that the allowlist is never dynamically updated and only checks for incoming IDs matching the fixed value. This makes the system vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by simply sending an ID matching `32'h8312`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   Move the assignment of `acl_oh_allowlist` from a direct assignment to a mechanism that allows for dynamic updates. This could involve:
    *   Reading the allowlist from a secure storage location (e.g., flash memory, secure registers).
    *   Updating the allowlist based on external inputs from a trusted source. 
    *   Implementing a mechanism for adding or removing entries from the allowlist based on specific criteria.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```verilog
               module foo_bar(data_out, data_in, incoming_id, address, clk, rst_n);
               output [31:0] data_out;
               input [31:0] data_in, incoming_id, address;
               input clk, rst_n;
               wire write_auth, addr_auth;
               reg [31:0] data_out, acl_oh_allowlist, q;
               assign write_auth = | (incoming_id & acl_oh_allowlist) ? 1 : 0; 
               always @*
               
                 acl_oh_allowlist <= 32'h8312; 
               
               assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00) ? 1: 0;
               always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
               
                 if (!rst_n)
                 
                   begin
                   
                     q <= 32'h0;
                     data_out <= 32'h0;
                   
                   end
                 
                 else
                 
                   begin
                   
                     q <= (addr_auth & write_auth) ? data_in: q;
                     data_out <= q;
                   
                   end
                 
                 end
               
               endmodule
