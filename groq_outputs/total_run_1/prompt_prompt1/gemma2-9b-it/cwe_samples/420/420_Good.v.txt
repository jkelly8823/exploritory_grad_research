VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Timing Side Channel Attack
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet utilizes a ternary operator (condition ? true_result : false_result) to assign a value to `addr_auth` based on the condition `address == 32'hF00 || address == 32'h800F00`. 

The issue arises from the potential for a timing side channel attack. An attacker could observe the time it takes for the code to evaluate the condition and determine the value of `address`. This is because the branch taken (either `address == 32'hF00` or `address == 32'h800F00` ) might have different execution times depending on the address value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Constant Time Comparison:**  Implement constant-time comparison algorithms to ensure that the execution time is independent of the input value (`address`). This prevents an attacker from gleaning information from timing variations.

* **Blinding:** Introduce randomization or blinding techniques to obscure the relationship between the input and the code's execution flow.

* **Randomization of Branching:** Use random branching (e.g., with a masking register) to make the execution time unpredictable. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00 || address == 32'h800F00) ? 1: 0;
