VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Race Condition
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a scenario where the `pass_mode` variable is used to control data flow. When `pass_mode` is high, `data_d` is assigned to `pass_data`. However, there's a potential for a race condition. If multiple threads or processes attempt to modify `pass_mode` simultaneously, the assignment of `data_d` to `pass_data` might happen in an inconsistent order or even be skipped altogether, leading to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Synchronization:** Implement synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores to ensure that only one thread or process can modify `pass_mode` at a time. This prevents multiple threads from accessing and changing `pass_mode` concurrently, mitigating the race condition risk.

2. **Atomic Operations:** Consider using atomic operations for the assignment of `pass_data` to `data_d` instead of a simple assignment statement. Atomic operations guarantee that the entire operation happens as a single, indivisible unit, reducing the chance of partial updates. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
...
logic [512-1:0] data_d, data_q
logic [512-1:0] pass_data;
...
 Write: begin
 
 ...
    if (pass_mode) begin
       
       pass_data = data_d;
       state_d = PassChk;
       pass_mode = 1'b0;
       
 ... 

end
