VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1,2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code directly uses `param('username')` and `param('password')` which are unsafe methods for handling user input. 

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks. Here's why:

*  **Direct User Input:** The `param` function is likely reading values directly from the HTTP request parameters.  Without any sanitization or validation, a malicious user could inject harmful code into the `username` and `password` fields.
* **Potential for Injection:**  An attacker could craft a username or password containing HTML tags, JavaScript, or other malicious code that would be executed when the request is processed. This allows attackers to potentially:
    * Steal user sessions or cookies.
    * Redirect users to malicious websites.
    * Deface the website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize User Input:** Always sanitize user input before using it in your code. You should escape special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `"` to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML or code.
* **Validate Input:**  Before using values passed in parameters, validate them against expected formats and lengths. This helps prevent injection attacks by ensuring that the input conforms to the required structure.
* **Use Prepared Statements:** If you're using a database, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Parameters are treated as data, not code, which prevents malicious code from being executed in your database queries.
* **Consider a Framework:** Using a robust web application framework that provides built-in security features can greatly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities like XSS and injection attacks. Most frameworks offer functions for safe input handling and validation. 



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  my $username=param('username');
                  my $password=param('password');
                  
                  if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
                  {
                  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
                  {
                  print "Login Successful";
                  }
                  else

                  print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
                  }
                  }
