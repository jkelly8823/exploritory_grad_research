VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Integer comparison vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `<>` operator for string comparison. This operator is intended for numerical comparison (not equality, as intended) and is likely a typo. Using  `<>` when comparing strings can lead to unexpected behaviors and potential security issues. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the `<>` operator with the equality operator `==` for string comparisons. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                 def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
		 
                   if len(actual_pw) <> len(typed_pw):
		   return 0
                   for i in len(actual_pw):
		   if actual_pw[i] <> typed_pw[i]:
		   return 0
                   
                   return 1
                 
                 
                 
               
               ```
