VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability due to Infinite Loop
EXPLANATION:
The `while` loop condition `(isValidUser == 0) && (count < MAX_ATTEMPTS)`  could lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.  If the `AuthenticateUser` function repeatedly returns 0 (indicating an invalid user), and `count` never reaches `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, the loop will continue indefinitely. This can exhaust system resources and potentially crash the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Add a Timeout:**  Implement a timeout mechanism within the `while` loop to prevent it from running indefinitely. This could involve using a timer or a sleep function.

2. **Limit Authentication Attempts:** Implement a mechanism to restrict the number of authentication attempts. After a certain number of failed attempts, either temporarily or permanently block the user.



3. **Robust Error Handling:** Ensure that `AuthenticateUser` handles errors gracefully and returns an appropriate value. Avoid relying solely on a 0/non-0 comparison, as it can be easily bypassed.



ORIGINAL CODE:


                  int validateUser(char *host, int port){
                        ...
                           int count = 0;while ((isValidUser == 0) && (count < MAX_ATTEMPTS)) {
                              if (getNextMessage(socket, username, USERNAME_SIZE) > 0) {if (getNextMessage(socket, password, PASSWORD_SIZE) > 0) {isValidUser = AuthenticateUser(username, password);}}count++;
                           }if (isValidUser) {return(SUCCESS);}else {return(FAIL);}
                     }
