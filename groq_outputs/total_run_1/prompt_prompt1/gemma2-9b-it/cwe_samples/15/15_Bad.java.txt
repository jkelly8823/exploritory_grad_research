VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line containing  `conn.setCatalog(request.getParameter("catalog"));`
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly inserts user-supplied data from the `request.getParameter("catalog")`  into an SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft malicious input containing SQL commands that would allow them to manipulate the database. For example, if the intended behavior is to switch to a specific database catalog based on the user's input, an attacker could enter a payload like  `' OR '1'='1` which would bypass authentication or retrieve sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries (like prepared statements) to separate user input from the SQL commands. This prevents the interpreter from treating user input as code.

2. **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize the user input before using it in any SQL query. This involves:
   - **Whitelisting:** Only allow specific, expected values for the catalog parameter.
   - **Escaping:**  Escape special characters in the user input to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL code. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
...conn.setCatalog(request.getParameter("catalog"));... 
```
