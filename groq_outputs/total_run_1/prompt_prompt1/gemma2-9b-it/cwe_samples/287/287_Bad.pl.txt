VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `$q->param('username')`  into a cookie without sanitization. An attacker could provide a malicious username containing JavaScript code, which would then be stored in the user's browser as a cookie. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser when they visit subsequent pages of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before storing any user-supplied data in a cookie, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters and code. Use a suitable HTML escaping function to ensure that any user-provided data is treated as data and not executable code.

2. **Use Prepared Statements (if applicable):** If you're using a database, use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks, which could also be exploited in combination with XSS vulnerabilities.

3. **Limit Cookie Data:** Store only essential information in cookies, and avoid storing sensitive data like passwords directly in cookies.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  my $q = new CGI;
                     if ($q->cookie('loggedin') ne "true") {
                        if (! AuthenticateUser($q->param('username'), $q->param('password'))) {ExitError("Error: you need to log in first");}else {
                              # Set loggedin and user cookies.$q->cookie(-name => 'loggedin',-value => 'true');
                                 $q->cookie(-name => 'user',-value => $q->param('username'));
                              
                           }
                     }
                     if ($q->cookie('user') eq "Administrator") {DoAdministratorTasks();}();}
