VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet you provided processes user-uploaded files through a `doPost` method. There's a risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because the filename extracted from the HTTP header (`filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\"))`) is directly used in the file path (`uploadLocation + filename`).  An attacker could manipulate the HTTP header to include malicious JavaScript within the filename, which could then be executed when the vulnerable application attempts to read or process the file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using the extracted filename in the file path, thoroughly sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or scripts.  You should encode the filename using a method like URL encoding or HTML escaping.
2. **Validate Filename Extensions:**  Check that the filename extension is allowed and corresponds to the expected type of file being uploaded (e.g., images, documents, etc.). This helps prevent the upload of files with malicious extensions that could execute code.
3. **Use a Secure File Upload Library:** Utilize a well-regarded file upload library that has built-in security features to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities and other common file upload risks.
