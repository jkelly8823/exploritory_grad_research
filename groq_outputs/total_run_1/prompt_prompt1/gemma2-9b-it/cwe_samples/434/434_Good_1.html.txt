VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
While this code snippet itself doesn't directly expose a vulnerability, it lacks proper input sanitization. If  the `FileUploadServlet`  doesn't sanitize the `filename` submitted through this form, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the uploaded file's name. 

Here's how it could happen:

1. **Malicious Input:** An attacker could submit a file name that includes malicious JavaScript code. For example,  `exploit.jpg?%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C%2Fscript%3E`.
2. **Direct Display:** If the `FileUploadServlet` directly displays the uploaded filenames (perhaps in a listing or confirmation), the injected JavaScript would execute in the victim's browser when they view the page. 

3. **File Execution (Potentially):** In more dangerous scenarios, depending on the server's configuration and the uploaded file type, the malicious code might even be executed when the file is processed or accessed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before processing the filename,  use a robust input sanitization library or function to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters, including HTML tags, JavaScript code, and other special characters.

2. **Validate File Types:**  Enforce strict validation of allowed file types to prevent potential attacks through file uploads.

3. **Encode Filenames for Display:** When displaying filenames, encode them to prevent the browser from interpreting any HTML or JavaScript within the filename.

ORIGINAL CODE:



                  <form action="FileUploadServlet" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
                     Choose a file to upload:<input type="file" name="filename"/><br/><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"/>
                     </form>
