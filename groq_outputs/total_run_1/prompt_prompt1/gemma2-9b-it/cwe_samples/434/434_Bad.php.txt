VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses `basename($_FILES['uploadedfile']['name'])` to construct the target file path. An attacker could manipulate the uploaded file's name to include directory traversal characters (like "..") and access files outside the intended "pictures" directory. 

For example, if an attacker uploads a file named ".." . "path/to/sensitive/file.txt", the target path would be constructed as "pictures/..path/to/sensitive/file.txt" potentially allowing access to the server's file system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Validate and sanitize the uploaded file's name before using it in the path. Remove any potentially harmful characters like "..", "/", "\", etc.

2. **Whitelist Allowed File Extensions:** Only allow uploads with specific, trusted file extensions.

3. **Use a Secure File Upload Library:** Utilize a well-established file upload library that includes built-in security measures against directory traversal attacks. 



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
// Define the target location where the picture being
// uploaded is going to be saved.
$target = "pictures/" . basename($_FILES['uploadedfile']['name']);

// Move the uploaded file to the new location.
if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'], $target)){echo "The picture has been successfully uploaded.";}else{echo "There was an error uploading the picture, please try again.";}

```
