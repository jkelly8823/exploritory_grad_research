VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Sanitization of User Input

EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user-supplied data from cookies (`c.getValue()`) to determine the `userRole`. There is no sanitization or validation of the `userRole` value, which could lead to several vulnerabilities:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could set a cookie with malicious JavaScript code in the `role` field. When the code retrieves `c.getValue()`, it could execute this malicious script, potentially hijacking user sessions or stealing sensitive information.

* **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker could manipulate the `role` cookie value to gain unauthorized access to restricted resources or functionalities.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Sanitize User Input:** 
   - Implement strict validation and sanitization of the `role` cookie value before using it. This can involve:
     - Using a whitelist to only accept specific valid role values.
     - Encoding user input to HTML entities to prevent script injection.
     - Escaping any special characters that could be interpreted as code. 

2. **Secure Cookie Handling:**
   - Configure cookies to be HttpOnly to prevent client-side scripting access.
   - Implement a secure cookie flag for enhanced confidentiality.
   - Set appropriate cookie expiration times and expiry logic.

3. **Authorization Checks:**
   - Implement robust authorization checks based on the sanitized `userRole` to ensure that users can only access resources permitted for their role.



ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                      Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();for (int i =0; i< cookies.length; i++) {Cookie c = cookies[i];if (c.getName().equals("role")) {userRole = c.getValue();}}
               
            }}
               
            
               
            
```
