VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:Possible Loss of Precision (Casting)
EXPLANATION: 
The code casts a float value (33457.8f) to an integer using (int) . This can result in data loss as the decimal portion of the float will be truncated. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*  **If you need the exact integer value:** Determine if there is a way to avoid the cast or use a larger data type that can accommodate the float value without loss of precision (e.g., `long`).
* **If you are aware of potential data loss:** Consider using a different approach that explicitly handles the truncation, or document the potential impact of the loss.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int i = (int) 33457.8f;
```
