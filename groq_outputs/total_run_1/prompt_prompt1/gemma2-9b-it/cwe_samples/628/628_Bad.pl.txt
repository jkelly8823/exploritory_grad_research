VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Sensitive Information Leak
EXPLANATION: 
The `ReportAuth` subroutine prints the `$username` in plain text to a log file. This could potentially expose sensitive user information if the log file is not properly secured.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Sanitize or mask sensitive information like usernames before logging.  For example, you could replace `$username` with a user ID or a generic placeholder.
2. Ensure that the log file is stored securely with appropriate access controls.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
                  sub ReportAuth {my ($username, $result, $fatal) = @_;PrintLog("auth: username=%s, result=%d", $username, $result);if (($result ne "success") && $fatal) {die "Failed!\n";}}
                     sub PrivilegedFunc{my $result = CheckAuth($username);ReportAuth($username, $result, 0);DoReallyImportantStuff();}
               
            
```
