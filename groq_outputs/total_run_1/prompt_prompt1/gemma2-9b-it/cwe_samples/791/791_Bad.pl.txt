VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$Username`) with a fixed path (`/home/user/`) to construct the filename. The user could potentially manipulate the `$Username` variable to include `..` sequences, which would allow them to traverse outside the intended directory and access files they shouldn't have access to.

For example, if the user inputs `../../etc/passwd`, the resulting filename would be `/home/user/../../etc/passwd`, allowing access to the system's password file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* Sanitize user input thoroughly to prevent the inclusion of `..` sequences and other potentially harmful characters.
* Use a secure directory structure that limits access to sensitive files and folders.
* Validate the validity of the constructed filename against allowed paths before accessing the file.



 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
