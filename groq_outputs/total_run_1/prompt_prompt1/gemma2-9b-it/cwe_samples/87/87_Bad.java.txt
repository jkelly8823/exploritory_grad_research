VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improperly sanitized user input, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. 
EXPLANATION:
The provided code attempts to sanitize user input (`input`) by replacing occurrences of the word "script" with a mask (`mask`). However, this approach is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks. Attackers can use various encoding techniques to bypass this simple replacement, injecting malicious scripts into the output.  For example, they could use HTML entity encoding (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   Use a robust library or framework specifically designed for input sanitization.
*   Employ HTML encoding to properly escape characters that have special meaning in HTML.
*   Consider using a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts from untrusted sources. 

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                  public String preventXSS(String input, String mask) {return input.replaceAll("script", mask);}
               );}
               
               ```
