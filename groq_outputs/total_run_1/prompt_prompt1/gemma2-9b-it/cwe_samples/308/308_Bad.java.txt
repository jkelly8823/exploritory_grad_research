VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Improper use of SHA hashing and potential for password storage vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 
-  The code uses `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA")` without specifying the version (e.g., SHA-256). Using SHA1 is considered insecure due to known vulnerabilities.

- The code calculates the hash of `plainTextIn` instead of the actual password. This means the stored password may not align with what the user enters during login.

- The password storage method is not secure. Variable `secret_password()` likely acts as a placeholder for a stored password hash. Ideally, passwords should be stored using a strong hashing algorithm (like bcrypt) with salting.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Upgrade to SHA-256:** Change `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA")` to `MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256")` to use a more secure hashing algorithm.

2.  **Hash the Password Correctly:**  Ensure the password being hashed is the user's actual entered password, not some intermediate `plainTextIn`.

3.  **Secure Password Storage:**  Implement a password hashing function that utilizes a strong algorithm like bcrypt, along with salting. This makes it much harder to crack passwords. **Do not store passwords in plain text.**

ORIGINAL CODE:


```java
                  String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
 //Login if hash matches stored hash
 if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
}               
```
