VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Storage of Plaintext Passwords
EXPLANATION:  The code snippet appears to directly store the result of a  `simple_digest` function call, which likely represents the hashed password, in a variable named `ctext`. This suggests a potential vulnerability if the `secret_password()` function is not retrieving a securely stored hash.  If `secret_password()` is retrieving a hash from insecure storage, it could expose the plaintext passwords to potential attackers.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Validate that the `secret_password()` function retrieves hashes from a secure, encrypted storage mechanism. 
* Do not store plaintext passwords anywhere in your application's code or configuration files. Always hash passwords before storing them.
* Use best practices for hashing passwords, including:
    *  A strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
    *   Salting unique to each user

ORIGINAL CODE:
 ```
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
  ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
  //Login if hash matches stored hash
  if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
    login_user();
  }
} 
```
