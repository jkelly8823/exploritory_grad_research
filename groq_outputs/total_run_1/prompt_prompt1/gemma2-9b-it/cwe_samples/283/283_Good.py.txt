VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for a SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `getCurrentUser()` and `getProcessOwner()` functions are not shown, but if they directly construct SQL queries using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, a malicious user could inject SQL code. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or even complete system takeover.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:**  Always sanitize any user input before using it in SQL queries. This means escaping special characters, validating data types, and using parameterized queries whenever possible.
2. **Use prepared statements:** Prepared statements are a safer way to execute SQL queries as they separate the SQL code from the data, preventing malicious code from being injected.
3. **Input validation:** Implement strict input validation rules to ensure that user input meets the expected format and data type.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                  def killProcess(processID):
                        user = getCurrentUser()
                           
                           #Check process owner against requesting user
                           if getProcessOwner(processID) == user:os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)return
                           else:print("You cannot kill a process you don't own")return
                        
                     
                  
               
            ```
