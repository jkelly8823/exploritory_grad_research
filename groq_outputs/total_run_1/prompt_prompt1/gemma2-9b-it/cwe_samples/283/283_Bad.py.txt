VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unrestricted Process Termination

EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses `os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)` to terminate a process.  `SIGKILL` sends a signal that cannot be caught or ignored by the process, leading to immediate termination without a chance for graceful cleanup.  This presents a risk if the processID passed to this function is malicious or unexpected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that `processID` is a valid, expected process ID.  This could involve checking for negative values, exceeding process ID limits, or using a whitelist of allowed process IDs.
2. **Signal Handling:** Consider using a less forceful signal like `signal.SIGINT` (interrupt) which allows the process a chance to handle the termination gracefully.
3. **Logging:**  Log all process termination attempts, including the process ID, the signal used, and any relevant context. This helps with auditing and troubleshooting potential misuse.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  def killProcess(processID):os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)
