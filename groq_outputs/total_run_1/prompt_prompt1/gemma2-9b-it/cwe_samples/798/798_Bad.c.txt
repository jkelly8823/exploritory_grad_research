VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Password 
EXPLANATION: The code uses a hardcoded password "Mew!".  This makes the system easily exploitable as anyone who knows the password can bypass authentication.
RECOMMENDATIONS:  

*   **Use a password hashing algorithm:** Store passwords securely using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
*   **Compare passwords using constant-time comparison:** Implement a technique to compare passwords securely, preventing timing attacks that could reveal password information.
*   **Implement proper input validation:** Sanitize and validate user input to prevent injection attacks and ensure that only expected data is processed. 


ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
                        if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
                              
                                 printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
                           }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
                     }
