VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: 

The code snippet directly exposes the database username ("scott") and password ("tiger") within the code. This practice is highly insecure as it allows anyone with access to the code to view these credentials. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   **Environment Variables:** Store database credentials in environment variables and retrieve them within the code. This keeps the credentials separate from the source code.
*   **Configuration Files:** Utilize a dedicated configuration file to store sensitive information like database credentials. Access these credentials from the configuration file rather than hardcoding them.
*   **Secure Secrets Management:**  Implement a secure secrets management system specifically designed to handle sensitive data like passwords. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
...DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");...
```
