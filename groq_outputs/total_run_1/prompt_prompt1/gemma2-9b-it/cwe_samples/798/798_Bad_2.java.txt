VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Password 
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores the administrative password as a string literal. This makes the password easily accessible to anyone who views the source code, posing a significant security risk. An attacker could then use this hardcoded password to gain unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   **Store passwords securely:** Instead of hardcoding the password, store it as a hash using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. This way, even if the code is compromised, the attacker won't have access to the actual password.
*   **Use an external configuration file:** Store sensitive information like passwords in an external configuration file. This allows for better management and separation of concerns.
*   **Implement a robust authentication mechanism:** Consider using industry-standard authentication mechanisms like OAuth or JWT for user verification, which provide more secure and flexible ways to handle credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public boolean VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.equals("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {System.out.println("Entering Diagnostic Mode...");return true;}System.out.println("Incorrect Password!");return false;
                  
               
               } 
```
