VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code snippet reveals sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly embedded within the properties file. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes these credentials to potential attackers who could gain unauthorized access to the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Never store sensitive data like usernames and passwords directly in configuration files.**
* **Utilize environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store and retrieve sensitive information.**
* **Implement proper encryption techniques to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.**
* **Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for all users.**

ORIGINAL CODE:

```properties
# Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...
           
```
