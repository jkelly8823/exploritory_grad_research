VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Password
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores the administrator password as a hardcoded string. This is highly insecure as the password is exposed in the source code and can be easily seen by anyone with access to it. An attacker could then bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Never store passwords as plain text in your code.
* Use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to hash the passwords before storing them.
* Store the hashed passwords along with a salt value to further enhance security.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
                        if (strcmp(password,"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {
                              
                                 printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0);
                           }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
                     } }
