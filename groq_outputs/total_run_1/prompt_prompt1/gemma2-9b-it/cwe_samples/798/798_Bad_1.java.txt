VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Password
EXPLANATION: The code uses a hardcoded password "Mew!" for administrator verification. This is a serious security vulnerability as the password is directly embedded in the code and can be easily discovered by attackers. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Store passwords securely:** Use a secure hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) to hash the entered password and compare it to a securely stored hash. Never store passwords in plain text. 
* **Use environment variables or a configuration file:** Store sensitive information like passwords in environment variables or a secure configuration file, rather than directly in the code. This allows for easier management and modification without needing to recompile the code.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}
               
               

               ```
