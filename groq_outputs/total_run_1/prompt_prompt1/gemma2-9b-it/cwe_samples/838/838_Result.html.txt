VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the use of the `onload` event handler within the `<img>` tag. An attacker could manipulate the `src` attribute to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when the image loads. In this case, `alert(document.cookie)` is executed, which reveals sensitive user data stored in cookies.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-  Sanitize all user-supplied data before using it in event handlers.
-  Consider using a framework or library that provides built-in protection against XSS attacks.
-  Encode special characters in user input to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<img src='pic.jpg' alt='altTextHere' onload='alert(document.cookie)' /> />
