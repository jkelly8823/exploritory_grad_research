VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The line `if (csr_exception_i.valid && csr_exception_i.cause[63] && !amo_valid_commit_o && commit_instr_i[0].fu != CSR) begin` checks multiple conditions, with one potential point of vulnerability: `csr_exception_i.cause[63]`. 
 
 If `csr_exception_i.cause` is not properly bounded, accessing `csr_exception_i.cause[63]` could lead to an out-of-bounds array access. This could result in a buffer overflow vulnerability, allowing an attacker to potentially execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking on `csr_exception_i.cause` to ensure that the index `63` is within the valid range of the array. This could be done by checking if `63` is less than the actual size of the array.

* **Defensive Programming:** Consider using safer data structures or techniques that mitigate the risk of buffer overflows, such as using strings with known lengths or using bounds-safe array operations.  



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
						if (csr_exception_i.valid && csr_exception_i.cause[63] && !amo_valid_commit_o && commit_instr_i[0].fu != CSR) begin
							
								exception_o = csr_exception_i;
								exception_o.tval = commit_instr_i[0].ex.tval;
							
							end
