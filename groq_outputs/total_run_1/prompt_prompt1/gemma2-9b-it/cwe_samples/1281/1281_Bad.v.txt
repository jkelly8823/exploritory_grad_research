VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Possible Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The line `csr_exception_i.cause[63]` accesses an element in the `cause` array using an index of 63.  If `csr_exception_i.cause` is not guaranteed to be at least 64 elements long, this could result in a buffer overflow.  A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to store more data in a buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and leading to crashes, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bounds Checking:**  Add a check to ensure that `csr_exception_i.cause` has at least 64 elements before accessing `csr_exception_i.cause[63]`.  For example:
   ```c 
   if (csr_exception_i.valid && csr_exception_i.cause != NULL && csr_exception_i.cause[63] && commit_instr_i[0].fu != CSR) begin
       // ... rest of the code ...
   end  
   ```
2. **Safe Array Access:**  Use safer array access methods that handle out-of-bounds access, such as:
    * Iterating over the array and checking indices within bounds.
    * Using containers like `std::vector` that manage memory automatically and prevent buffer overflows.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
						if (csr_exception_i.valid && csr_exception_i.cause[63] && commit_instr_i[0].fu != CSR) begin
							
								exception_o = csr_exception_i;
								exception_o.tval = commit_instr_i[0].ex.tval;
							
							end
						       
					
       
					
					```
