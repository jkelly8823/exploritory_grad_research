VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises in the `proc_msg` function.  It assumes that all input strings will have a fixed size preamble ("preamble: "). However, when calling `proc_msg` with `s` containing "preamble: message\n", the calculated `jnklen` would result in a size that violates the `buf` buffer's allocation. 

Since the `buf` is fixed at a size calculated as `pre_len - msg_len`, and `jnklen` is the length of the part before the colon, which might be less than the preamble length in other cases, this could lead to a buffer overflow when processing the received message.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Dynamically Allocate Buffer:** Instead of using a fixed-size buffer like `buf[]`, allocate memory dynamically based on the actual `msg_len` calculated from the input string.
2. **Validate Input Length:** Before processing the message, validate `jnklen` against the expected preamble length. Reject or handle invalid lengths to prevent buffer overflows.
3. **Use Safe String Functions:** Consider using safer string manipulation functions that perform bounds checking, such as `strncpy` or `strlcpy`, to avoid writing beyond the allocated buffer.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```c
int proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len)
{
int pre_len = sizeof("preamble: ");    // Note space at the end of the string - assume all strings have preamble with space
if (pre_len <= msg_len) { // Log error; return error_code; }
char buf[pre_len - msg_len];
... Do processing here and set status
return status;
}

char *s = "preamble: message\n";
char *sl = strchr(s, ':');        // Number of characters up to ':' (not including space)
int jnklen = sl == NULL ? 0 : sl - s;    // If undefined pointer, use zero length
int ret_val = proc_msg ("s",  jnklen);    // Violate assumption of preamble length, end up with negative value, blow out stack
         
 stack
         
        ```
