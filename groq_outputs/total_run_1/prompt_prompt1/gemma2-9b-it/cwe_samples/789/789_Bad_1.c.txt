VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code computes the size of the buffer `len` using the difference between two integers (`a - b`).  The issue is that the calculation `a - b` could potentially result in a negative value. When `a` is less than `b` (`a = 5` and `b = 6`),  `len` becomes `-1`.  

Attempting to create a buffer of size `-1` will likely lead to:
* **Invalid Memory Access:**  The program might try to allocate memory outside the bounds of the allocated heap, resulting in a crash or unpredictable behavior.
* **Stack Overflow:**  If the buffer is on the stack, a negative size could cause the program to write past the stack boundary, overwriting important data on the stack and potentially crashing the program.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:**  Ensure that both `a` and `b` are carefully validated. If they could come from user input or external sources, sanitize them to prevent negative values. 2. **Bound Checking:**  Always check the calculated size of the buffer (`len`) and ensure it's non-negative before using it to allocate memory. If `len` is negative, handle the situation appropriately (e.g., by setting a default size, logging an error, or terminating the program). 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
		    int a = 5, b = 6;
		    size_t len = a - b;
		    char buf[len];    // Just blows up the stack
		    
```
