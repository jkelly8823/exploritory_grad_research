VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Out-of-Bounds Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `$num`, a value obtained from an untrusted source (`GetUntrustedNumber()`), to index into an array `@messages`. If `GetUntrustedNumber()` returns a value greater than or equal to the size of the `@messages` array (which is initially empty), this will lead to an out-of-bounds buffer overflow.  An attacker could potentially exploit this to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate and Sanitize Input:** Before using `$num` to index the array, validate its value to ensure it's within a safe range. You can use bounds checking (`if $num >= 0 and $num < @messages @count`) to prevent accessing elements beyond the array's bounds.
2. **Input Length Limit:** Consider imposing a maximum length limit on `$num` to mitigate the impact of potentially oversized values.
3. **Use Safe Array Methods:** Explore using array methods that automatically handle bounds checking, such as `@$messages[$num] = "Hello World"` if `$num` is guaranteed to be a valid index.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();
my @messages = ();
$messages[$num] = "Hello World";
```
