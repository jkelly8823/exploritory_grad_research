VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `GetUntrustedInt()` to obtain the size of a HashMap. If this function returns a negative or excessively large integer value, it could potentially cause an integer overflow when assigned to the `size` variable. This overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, buffer overflows, or even denial-of-service attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate input:** 
   - Ensure that `GetUntrustedInt()` returns a non-negative and reasonably sized integer. Implement checks to bound the input value to a safe range.
2. **Use a larger data type:** Consider using a data type capable of handling a wider range of values, such as `long` or `int64_t`, to minimize the risk of overflow.
 3. **Use safe libraries:** Explore libraries specifically designed for secure data handling and input validation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
unsigned int size = GetUntrustedInt();
HashMap list = new HashMap(size); 
```
