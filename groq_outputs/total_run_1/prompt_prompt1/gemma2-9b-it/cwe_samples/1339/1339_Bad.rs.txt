VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow

EXPLANATION:

The vulnerability lies within the `rec_float` function. The calculation `1500.0 / z` can lead to an integer overflow if the value of `z` is very small. This is because integer division will be performed before the result is converted to a floating-point number, potentially resulting in a value that exceeds the maximum representable integer. 

This can cause unexpected behavior in the `rec_float` function and subsequently propagate through the `float_calc` function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Ensure `z` is never close to zero:**
   - Verify that the input `z` to the `rec_float` function is always a sufficiently large value to avoid division by small numbers.
   - Add checks to handle cases where `z` might be close to zero and take appropriate actions, such as returning an error or using a fallback value.

2. **Perform division using floating-point numbers:**
   - Explicitly cast `1500.0` and `z` to `f64` before performing the division: 
     ```rust
     let result = (1500.0 as f64 / z as f64) - (815.0 as f64);
     ```


ORIGINAL CODE:

```rust
		      fn rec_float(y: f64, z: f64) -> f64 
		      {
		      
			108.0 - ((815.0 - 1500.0 / z) / y);
		      
		      }
		      
		      fn float_calc(turns: usize) -> f64 
		      {
		      
			let mut x: Vec<f64> = vec![4.0, 4.25];
			(2..turns + 1).for_each(|number| 
			{
			
			  x.push(rec_float(x[number - 1], x[number - 2]));
			
			});
			
			x[turns]
		      
		      }
```
