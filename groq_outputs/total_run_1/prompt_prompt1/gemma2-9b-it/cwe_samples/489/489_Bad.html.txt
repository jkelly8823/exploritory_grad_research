VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
EXPLANATION:  An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript into the `username` and `password` fields of the form. Since the form data is sent to `authenticate_login.cgi` directly and without any sanitization, an attacker's script could be executed on the server, potentially allowing them to steal user credentials or hijack sessions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on both server and client sides.  
   *  **Server Side:**  Use a technique like HTML encoding to escape any user-supplied data before displaying it on the webpage or processing it.
   *  **Client Side:**  Encourage users to only submit valid data. You could use client-side JavaScript to perform basic validation before submission.  

2. **Use Prepared Statements:** When processing data from the form, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This technique treats user input as data, not executable code. 
3. **Employ a Secure Authentication Mechanism:** Consider using more robust authentication methods like OAuth or multi-factor authentication to enhance security.
