VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper sanitization of user input leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:  
The code directly uses user-provided input (`$username` and `$password`) to construct the `userdata` cookie without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into these variables, which would then be stored in the cookie and executed by the user's browser when they visit the website again.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before storing user input in the cookie, sanitize it to remove any potential HTML or JavaScript code. You can use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` or a dedicated input sanitization library to achieve this.

2. **Validate input:** Implement input validation to ensure that the user-provided data meets the expected format and constraints. For example, check if the username and password meet minimum length requirements and contain only allowed characters.

3. **Encode cookies:** Consider encoding the cookie data using a secure method, such as base64 encoding, to make it more difficult for attackers to interpret and exploit.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function persistLogin($username, $password){$data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);setcookie ("userdata", $data);}
);}
```
