VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double free vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code presents a double free vulnerability where the memory pointed to by `ptr` is freed twice. 
This can lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior. 
The first `free(ptr);` is inside an `if` statement, meaning it might not always be executed. 
The second `free(ptr);` is executed unconditionally, regardless of the value of `abrt`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Remove the redundant `free(ptr);` statement outside the `if` block.

2. Ensure that the memory allocation using `malloc()` is always followed by a corresponding `free()` call.
   Avoid relying on conditional `free()` statements that might lead to memory leaks or double frees.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
```
