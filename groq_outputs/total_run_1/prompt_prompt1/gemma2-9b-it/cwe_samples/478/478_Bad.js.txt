VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None found
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any immediately apparent vulnerabilities. 

It performs a simple calculation (`step = input1 + input2`) and uses a `switch` statement to trigger different alerts based on the value of `step`. 

There are no obvious injection points, logic flaws, or security bypasses.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  The code appears safe as is. However, best practices would include:
    * **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate `input1` and `input2`.  Ensure they are numerical and within an expected range. This prevents unexpected behavior and potential denial-of-service attacks.

    * **Error Handling:**  Consider adding error handling to gracefully manage cases where `input1` or `input2` are invalid.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
let step = input1 + input2;
switch(step) {
case 1:
   alert("Process step 1.");
   break;
case 2:
   alert("Process step 2.");
   break;
case 3:
   alert("Process step 3.");
   break;

}
// program execution continues...
```
