## Vulnerability Analysis 

**VULNERABLE:** YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 10, 11, 13-18
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:**  Incomplete case statement. The `case` statement handling user input does not cover all possible input values (`3'h0`, `3'h1`, `3'h2` ) and missing `:` separators after each case.
**EXPLANATION:**

The provided code snippet implements a finite state machine (FSM).  The `case` statement is used to determine the next state of the FSM based on the `user_input`. However, there are several issues:

* **Incomplete Cases:**  The cases for `3'h0`, `3'h1`, and `3'h2`  in the `case` statement lack code blocks and are incomplete. This means that  if the `user_input` matches these values, the FSM will not transition to a defined state and might result in undefined behavior.
* **Missing Colons:** The case statements should be followed by a colon (`:`) to indicate the start of the code block for each case. Mistakenly omitting these colons will lead to syntax errors.

This incomplete and potentially incorrect case statement introduces a vulnerability because it leaves the FSM in an undefined state for certain input values. This could lead to unexpected behavior, unexpected state transitions, or even system crashes.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Complete All Cases:** Ensure that code blocks are provided for all possible `user_input` values within the `case` statement.
2. **Add Colons:** Add colons (`:`) at the end of each case label to correctly define the code blocks.
3. **Input Validation:** Consider adding input validation to check if the `user_input` is within the expected range. This can help prevent unexpected behavior caused by invalid input values.

                input [2:0] user_input; 
                input clk, rst_n;
                output reg [2:0] out;
                reg [1:0] state;
                always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n )
                
                begin
                
                
				  if (!rst_n)
				  
					state = 3'h0;
				  
                  else
				  case (user_input)
                  
					3'h0:
					3'h1:
					3'h2:
					3'h3: state = 2'h3;
					3'h4: state = 2'h2;
					3'h5: state = 2'h1;
                  
                endcase
                
                end
                out <= {1'h1, state};
                
                endmodule
