VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Integer Overflow Potential
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet exhibits a potential integer overflow vulnerability. 

Within the `case` statement, the variable `state` is assigned integer values using literals like `2'h3`, `2'h2`, and `2'h1`. If `user_input` is outside the anticipated range for these cases (0 to 3 in this example), the index for accessing the `case` block could exceed the bounds of the `switch` statement, leading to unintended code execution or potential crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Clearly Define Input Range:** Establish clear bounds for the `user_input` variable. Validate the input to ensure it falls within an acceptable range of values.
* **Consider Enum Types:**  Use an enumeration type if the allowed states have meaningful names and fixed values. This improves readability and can help prevent unintended assignments. Python has great support for enums.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```
                case (user_input)
                3'h0:
                3'h1:
                3'h2:
                3'h3: state = 2'h3;
                3'h4: state = 2'h2;
                3'h5: state = 2'h1;
                default: state = 2'h0;
              
                endcase
              
            case
              
            
              
            
```
