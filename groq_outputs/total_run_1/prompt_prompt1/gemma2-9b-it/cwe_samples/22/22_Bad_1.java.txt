VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure File Deletion

EXPLANATION:
The code directly constructs a file path using user input obtained from `getInputPath()`. This poses a risk of directory traversal attacks. An attacker could provide a malicious input like "../etc/passwd" to access and potentially delete sensitive files outside the intended "safe_dir" directory. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Validate and sanitize the user input before constructing the file path. This involves removing any characters that are not allowed in safe directory names and ensuring the path remains within the designated safe directory.

2. **Use a Safe File Path Construction Method:** Instead of directly concatenating user input with strings, consider using a library like Java's `Files` or `Path` classes that provide secure methods for constructing file paths.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                  String path = getInputPath();if (path.startsWith("/safe_dir/")){File f = new File(path);f.delete()}
               
               ```
