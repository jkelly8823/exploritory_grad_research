VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential File Upload Vulnerability 

EXPLANATION:

The provided code snippet represents a simple HTML form for file uploads. While it does not explicitly showcase the vulnerability, it lacks crucial security measures that could lead to a file upload vulnerability.  

Here's why:

* **Unvalidated File Input:** The code directly accepts a user-provided file through the `<input type="file">` element. Without proper validation on the server-side (within  `FileUploadServlet`), an attacker could potentially upload malicious files disguised as harmless content.
* **Missing Size and Type Restrictions:**  The code doesn't specify any limits on the file size or allowed file types.  This opens the door for attackers to upload oversized files that could crash the server or files with harmful extensions.

* **Potential for Directory Traversal:** If the `FileUploadServlet`  doesn't properly sanitize user input related to file paths, an attacker might be able to manipulate the uploaded file's destination, potentially allowing access to sensitive system files or directories.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Server-Side Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation within `FileUploadServlet` to:
   * **Check File Size:** Restrict uploads based on a predetermined maximum file size.
   * **Validate File Type:**  Allow only specific file extensions that are safe and relevant to the application's intended purpose (e.g., .txt, .jpg, .pdf).
   * **Sanitize File Names:**  Avoid using user-provided file names directly; generate safe and unique file names to prevent potential conflicts and directory traversal attacks.

2. **Utilize Prepared Statements:**  When interacting with databases related to file uploads, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

3. **Restrict File Upload Location:**  Configure the server to upload files only to a dedicated, secure directory with controlled permissions.
