VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the construction of the `$profilePath` variable.  It directly concatenates the user-supplied `$username` parameter with the `$dataPath`. An attacker could provide a specially crafted username containing directory traversal characters (e.g., ".." or "/"), allowing them to access files outside the intended "profiles" directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Thoroughly sanitize the `$username` parameter before using it in the file path. This involves removing or escaping any potentially harmful characters, especially those related to directory traversal. Use a validated whitelist approach to ensure only allowed characters are used.

2. **Use Path Templating:** Consider using a safe path templating library to construct the file path dynamically. This can help prevent direct manipulation of the path by user input.

   ORIGINAL CODE:
                  my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles";my $username = param("user");my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
                     open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");print "<ul>\n";while (<$fh>) {print "<li>$_</li>\n";}print "</ul>\n";
