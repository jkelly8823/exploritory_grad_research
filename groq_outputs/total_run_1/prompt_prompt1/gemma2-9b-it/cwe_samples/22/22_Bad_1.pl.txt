VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a classic directory traversal vulnerability. The line `my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;` directly concatenates unsanitized user input (`$Username`) with a file path.  An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious `$Username` value that includes directory traversal sequences like `../`, allowing them to potentially access files outside the intended directory ("/home/user/").

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.  Escape any special characters in `$Username` before using it in the file path.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries:** If possible, use parameterized queries or prepared statements when building file paths. This helps prevent direct code injection of user input.

3. **Limit File Access:** Restrict the directory structure that your application can access using appropriate file system permissions.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
