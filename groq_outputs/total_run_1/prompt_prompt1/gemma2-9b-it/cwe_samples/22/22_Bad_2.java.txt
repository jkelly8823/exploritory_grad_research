VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unvalidated File Upload

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a file upload functionality which lacks proper validation of the uploaded filenames.  An attacker could leverage this vulnerability by uploading a file with a maliciously crafted filename, potentially leading to a variety of exploits like:

* **Directory Traversal:** If the filename includes malicious path components (e.g., "..") an attacker could attempt to access files outside the intended upload directory.
* **Overwrite Existing Files:** An attacker could overwrite existing files by using a filename that already exists in the target directory.
* **Code Execution:** In some cases,  an attacker could upload a specially crafted file designed to execute arbitrary code on the server.

The vulnerability stems from the direct use of the uploaded filename without any sanitization. It relies solely on the `request` object's `Content-Type` header and the assumption that the filename is correctly encoded.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize File Names:**
    * Use a whitelist of allowed characters or file extensions.
    *  Remove potentially dangerous path characters (e.g., "..", "/", ":", "*").
    *  Always encode filenames before using them in file system operations.
2. **Validate Content Type:** 
    * Ensure the `Content-Type` header correctly identifies the upload as `multipart/form-data`.
    *  Consider validating additional parameters within the `Content-Type` to ensure proper formatting.
3. **Use Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * Implement proper permissions for the upload directory and files.
    * Avoid using relative paths in filenames.
    * If possible, use a temporary file storage location before moving it to the final destination.
