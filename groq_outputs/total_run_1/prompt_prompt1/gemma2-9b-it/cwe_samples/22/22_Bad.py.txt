VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)` to construct the path to the file. If the user provides a malicious filename containing `..` (parent directory) sequences, an attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directory, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

Let's break it down:

* `os.getcwd()`: This function returns the current working directory.
*  `filename = sys.argv[1]`:  This line takes the first command-line argument provided by the user and assigns it to the `filename` variable.

An attacker could provide a filename like `../../etc/passwd`, which would try to read the `passwd` file from the parent directory of the current working directory, potentially revealing sensitive system information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using the `filename` in the path construction, sanitize it to remove any potentially dangerous characters like `..` or `/`. 
2. **Use Absolute Paths:** Consider using an absolute path instead of relying on relative paths that can be manipulated. This increases security by specifying the exact location of the file.
3. **Whitelist Allowed File Names:**  Create a whitelist of allowed file names and only process filenames that are present in the whitelist. 

ORIGINAL CODE:           
                  
                  import os
                  import sys
                  def main():
                     
                     filename = sys.argv[1]
                     path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
                     try:
                        
                        with open(path, 'r') as f:
                           
                           file_data = f.read()
                           
                        
                     except FileNotFoundError as e:
                        
                        print("Error - file not found")
                        
                     
                  main()
