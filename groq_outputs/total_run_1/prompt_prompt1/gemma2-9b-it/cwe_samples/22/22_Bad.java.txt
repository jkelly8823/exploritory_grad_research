VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Parameter Handling - Arbitrary File Reading
EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability stems from directly using the value of `System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile")` without validation. An attacker could manipulate this system property at runtime to specify a file path outside the expected directory, potentially allowing them to read sensitive files or cause a denial-of-service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate the file path:** Implement strict validation to ensure the provided filename conforms to a predefined whitelist of allowed paths or patterns. 
2. **Use a secure configuration mechanism:** Avoid hard-coding file paths in the code. Instead, leverage a secure configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) to store the dictionary file path.  
3. **Sanitize user input:** If the dictionary file path is coming from user input, sanitize it thoroughly to remove any malicious or unexpected characters. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String filename = System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile");
File dictionaryFile = new File(filename);
```
