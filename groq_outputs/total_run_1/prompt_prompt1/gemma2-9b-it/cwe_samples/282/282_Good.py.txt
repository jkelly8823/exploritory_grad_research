VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing input validation for `processID`. 
EXPLANATION: The code takes a `processID` as input but doesn't validate its format or ensure it represents a valid process. An attacker could provide an invalid or malformed `processID`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. Additionally, there is no check for non-existent processes, which could also lead to errors. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate `processID`:** Ensure the `processID` is a positive integer and use a library like `psutil` to verify its existence before attempting to kill it.
2. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle situations where the provided `processID` is invalid or the process doesn't exist.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                  def killProcess(processID):
                        user = getCurrentUser()
                           
                           #Check process owner against requesting user
                           if getProcessOwner(processID) == user:os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)return
                           else:print("You cannot kill a process you don't own")return
                        
                     
                  
               
            ```
