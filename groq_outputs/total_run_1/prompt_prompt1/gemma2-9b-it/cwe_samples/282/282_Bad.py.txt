VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unrestricted Process Termination 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet utilizes the `os.kill()` function to terminate a process forcefully using `signal.SIGKILL`. While this functionality is necessary in certain scenarios, the lack of input validation and error handling presents a vulnerability.

An attacker could potentially provide an invalid process ID, leading to unexpected behavior or system instability. Additionally, the use of `signal.SIGKILL` bypasses normal process termination procedures, which could leave resources in an inconsistent state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that the provided `processID` is a valid integer and corresponds to an existing process.
2. **Error Handling:** Incorporate error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid process IDs or other potential exceptions.
3. **Consider Alternatives:** For situations where forceful termination is necessary, explore alternative approaches such as sending a SIGTERM signal first, allowing the process to terminate gracefully.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def killProcess(processID):
  os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)  
```
