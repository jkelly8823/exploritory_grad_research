VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Side-Effect Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:  The code snippet presents a potential side-effect vulnerability due to the positioning of `Do_Y()` after the conditional `if (condition==true)Do_X();`.  

If `Do_Y()` has unintended side effects (e.g., modifying global state or performing actions with consequences outside its intended scope) and the `condition` is always true, `Do_Y()` will always execute.  This can lead to unintended behavior and unpredictable results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Separate Concerns:**  Move `Do_Y()` to its own conditional block or separate its execution from the `if` statement if it is not intended to always execute when `condition` is true.
2. **Review Side Effects:** Carefully analyze `Do_Y()` to determine if it has any unintended side effects. If it does, consider refactoring to mitigate those effects.



ORIGINAL CODE:

                  if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
