VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Using MD5 for password hashing is insecure. MD5 is a widely known collision-prone hashing algorithm, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks. 

EXPLANATION: 

The code snippet uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to store passwords.  MD5 is considered obsolete and extremely insecure for password hashing due to its susceptibility to collisions.  An attacker could potentially find collisions, allowing them to map multiple passwords to the same hash value and gain unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

* **Switch to a stronger hashing algorithm:**  Use a modern, cryptographically secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt. These algorithms are designed to be resistant to brute-force attacks and have a much higher computational cost, making them significantly more secure. 
* **Salted hashing:**  Always use a unique salt (random data) for each password before hashing. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.
* **Securely store salts:**  Store the salts separately from the hashed passwords, ideally in a secure and encrypted location.

ORIGINAL CODE:



                  def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                        
                        # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                        return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
