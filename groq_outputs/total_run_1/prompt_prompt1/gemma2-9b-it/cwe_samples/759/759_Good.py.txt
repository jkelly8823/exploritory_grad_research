VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Use of MD5 for Password Hashing
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to store passwords. MD5 is a known weak hashing algorithm that is vulnerable to collision attacks. This means that it's possible for different passwords to produce the same hash value, leading to a compromise of user account security.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Replace MD5 with a stronger hashing algorithm:**  Use algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt, which are designed to be more resistant to attacks. These algorithms use adaptive rounds and salt values, making it computationally expensive to find collisions. 

2. **Use a proper salt:** The code mentions a salt (`SaltGoesHere`), but it's not generated securely.  
   * Salts should be unique and randomly generated for each user. 
   * Store the salt along with the hashed password so that it can be used for verification.

3. **Store passwords securely:**  Never store passwords in plain text. Always hash them before storing them in your database.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```python
                  def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                        
                        # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                        return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
                  
               
               ```
