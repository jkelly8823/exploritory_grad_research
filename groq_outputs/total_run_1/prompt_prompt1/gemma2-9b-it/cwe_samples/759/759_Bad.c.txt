VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for direct password exposure
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet stores the calculated password hash (`ctext`) in an unprotected manner. If this variable is accessible outside the immediate scope of this function, or if there are memory leaks or issues with garbage collection, the password hash may become inadvertently exposed. 

RECOMMENDATION:
- Sanitize the access to `ctext` : The variable `ctext` should only be used within the `check_passwd` function or passed to authorized functions with controlled access.
- Implement secure memory management: Ensure that memory allocated for `ctext` is properly deallocated to prevent memory leaks and potential exposure.
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
                        //Login if hash matches stored hash
                        if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}}



``` 


It's important to note that depending on the implementation details of `simple_digest` and `secret_password`, there might be additional vulnerabilities. The analysis provided focuses on the immediate concerns visible in the snippet.
