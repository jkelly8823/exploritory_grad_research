VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Direct File System Access
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a direct file system access vulnerability. It reads an XML file, `Constants.INTEREST_RATE_FILE`, from the local filesystem using `ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()`. This approach leaves the application vulnerable to several potential issues, including:

* **Path Traversal:** An attacker could manipulate the `Constants.INTEREST_RATE_FILE` value to access files outside the intended directory structure, potentially enabling them to read sensitive data or even execute arbitrary code. 
* **Denial of Service:** An attacker could overwrite or delete the XML file, leading to a denial of service condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a Parameterized Query:** If possible, sanitize and parameterize any file paths used in the application. Avoid directly embedding file names in the code.
* **Centralize Configuration:** Store file paths and other sensitive information in a secure configuration file, external to the codebase.
* **Restrict File Access:** Implement strict access control mechanisms to limit which users or processes have permission to read or modify the XML file and its directory.
* **Use Immutable Inputs:** Whenever possible, treat any user-provided input as potentially malicious and validate or sanitize it before using it to construct file paths.
