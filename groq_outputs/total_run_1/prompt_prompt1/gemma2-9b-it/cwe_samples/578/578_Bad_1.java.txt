VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper use of class loading and potential for remote code execution.
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code dynamically loads a class named "someClass" using a custom class loader. The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of robust input validation and control over the class being loaded. This opens the door to a potential remote code execution (RCE) attack. 

An attacker could potentially manipulate the "someClass" name to load malicious code. The  `newInstance()` method then executes the loaded class, which could result in arbitrary code being run within the application's context. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** If the "someClass" name is derived from user input, sanitize it thoroughly to prevent injection of malicious class names.

2. **Whitelist Classes:** Maintain a whitelist of approved class names that are allowed to be loaded. Reject any attempts to load classes not on the whitelist.

3. **Use a Secure Class Loading Mechanism:** Explore using Java's SecurityManager or Java's URLClassLoader with restricted permissions to limit the scope of class loading and mitigate RCE risks.

4. **Implement Code Validation:** Validate the loaded class and its methods before executing them to ensure they meet security requirements. This could involve static analysis or runtime checks.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
@Stateless
public class LoaderSessionBean implements LoaderSessionRemote {
 
    public LoaderSessionBean() {
        try {
            ClassLoader loader = new CustomClassLoader();
            Class c = loader.loadClass("someClass");
            Object obj = c.newInstance();
            /* perform some task that uses the new class instance member variables or functions */
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ...
        }
    }
 
    public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    }
}
```
