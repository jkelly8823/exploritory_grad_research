VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability. 
EXPLANATION:
The `fgets(buf, BUF_SZ, f)` function does not guarantee that input will be limited to the size of the `buf` array. If a file contains more data than `BUF_SZ`, it could overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to a crash or security exploit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Validate Input Length:** Ensure that the input read from the file does not exceed the `BUF_SZ` limit. You can do this by checking the return value of `fgets`, which indicates the number of characters read (excluding the newline).  If the return value is equal to `BUF_SZ`, it means the buffer was filled to capacity, and further processing should be avoided.

* **Use Safe Alternatives:** Consider using safer alternatives to `fgets` that provide built-in bounds checking, such as `read()` with explicit size limitations or specialized libraries designed for secure file input. 



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int decodeFile(char* fName) {
                        char buf[BUF_SZ];FILE* f = fopen(fName, "r");if (!f) {printf("cannot open %s\n", fName);return DECODE_FAIL;}else {
                              while (fgets(buf, BUF_SZ, f)) {if (!checkChecksum(buf)) {return DECODE_FAIL;}else {decodeBlock(buf);}}
                           }fclose(f);return DECODE_SUCCESS;
                     }
