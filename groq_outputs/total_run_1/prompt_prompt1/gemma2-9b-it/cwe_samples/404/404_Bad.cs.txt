## Vulnerability Analysis

**VULNERABLE:** YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 1, 2
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:**  Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
**EXPLANATION:** The code uses a concatenated string (`queryString`) directly within the `SqlCommand` object.  This leaves the code susceptible to SQL Injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `queryString` to insert malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data, modify or delete existing data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Parameterize Queries:** Instead of directly inserting `queryString` into the SQL command, use parameterized queries. This involves creating placeholders in the SQL string and passing the values separately as parameters to the `SqlCommand` object.

   ```csharp
   string connString = "..."; 
   string queryString = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = @username";
   SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
   SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString, conn);
   cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@username", username); 
   // ... rest of the code ...
   ```

2. **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the `username` variable (or any other user-supplied data) before constructing the query. 

   * Sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters.
   * Use whitelists to only allow expected characters or values.

3. **Use a Stored Procedure:** Store the query logic in a parameterized stored procedure on the database server. This provides an additional layer of security as stored procedures are compiled and executed on the database, minimizing the risk of injection attacks.


**ORIGINAL CODE:**

```csharp
...SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);
cmd.Connection = conn;
conn.Open();
SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
HarvestResults(rdr);
conn.Connection.Close();
...
```
