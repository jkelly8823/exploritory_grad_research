VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unclosed try-with-resources block, leading to potential resource leak if an exception occurs.

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses a  `BufferedReader` to read lines from a file.  It's good practice to use the try-with-resources statement to ensure that the `BufferedReader`  is automatically closed, even if an exception occurs. In this case,  the `BufferedReader` is opened and read from, but it is only explicitly closed using `fil.Close()`  at the end of the method. If an exception is thrown during file reading, the `BufferedReader` might not be closed, leading to a resource leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Refactor the code to use try-with-resources:

```java
private void processFile(String fName) {
    try (BufferedReader fil = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fName))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = fil.readLine()) != null) {
            processLine(line);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception appropriately
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                private void processFile(string fName){BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));String line;while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){processLine(line);}fil.Close();}
               
            ```
