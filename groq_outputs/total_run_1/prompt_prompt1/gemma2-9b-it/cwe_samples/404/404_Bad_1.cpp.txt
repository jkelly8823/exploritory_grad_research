VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates a potential memory leak. When the `heap` flag is true, a new integer array is dynamically allocated on the heap using `new int[2]`. However, there's no guarantee that `delete[] p` will always be executed. If the `heap` flag is false, the dynamically allocated array will be leaked because the `delete[]` line is conditionally executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Ensure `delete[] p` is always executed:** 
   - Move the `delete[] p` statement outside the conditional block to ensure it's always called, regardless of the value of `heap`.


   ```c++
   class A {
     public:
       void foo(bool heap) {
         int localArray[2] = {11, 22};
         int* p = localArray;
         if (heap) {
           p = new int[2];
         }
         delete[] p; // Always delete the dynamically allocated memory
       }
   };
   ```



ORIGINAL CODE:


```c++
                  class A{void foo(bool);};void A::foo(bool heap) {int localArray[2] = {11,22};int *p = localArray;if (heap){p = new int[2];}delete[] p;}
               
```
