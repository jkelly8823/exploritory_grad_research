VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Exception Handling
EXPLANATION:  The code lacks specific exception handling for potential `SQLExceptions` that may arise during the database connection establishment. Catching a generic `Exception` allows all types of errors to be caught and logged, potentially masking specific database connection issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Specific Exception Handling:**  Instead of catching a generic `Exception`, catch `SQLException` specifically. This allows for targeted error handling and prevents masking of database-related problems. 
   ```java
   try {
       Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);
   } catch (SQLException e) {
       log(e);
       // Consider additional actions like retrying with exponential backoff or notifying an administrator.
   } 
   ```

2. **Detailed Logging:**  Provide more informative logging messages that include the specific SQL error code and message. This will aid in debugging and understanding the root cause of the issue.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}
               
               ```
