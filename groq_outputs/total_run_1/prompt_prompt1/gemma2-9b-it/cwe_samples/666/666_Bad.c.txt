VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Double Free
EXPLANATION: The code snippet demonstrates a classic double free vulnerability. The line  `free(ptr);` is executed twice.  First, inside the  `if (abrt)` block, and then again outside of it. Releasing the same memory location twice can lead to segmentation faults, program crashes, or memory corruption, as the memory becomes  a source of confusion for the program's memory management.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Remove the double free:**  Ensure that  `free(ptr);` is only executed once, ideally after the  `if (abrt)` block. Here's a possible fix:

   ```c
   char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
   ...
   if (abrt) {
       free(ptr);
       ptr = NULL; // Ensure ptr doesn't point to freed memory
   }
   ...
   if (ptr != NULL) { // only free if ptr is not NULL
       free(ptr);
       ptr = NULL; 
   }
   ```

   * This approach safeguards against accidental double-free by setting `ptr` to `NULL` after the first potential freeing.
   
2. **Careful Conditional Logic:** Review the logic that controls the `abrt` condition. Ensure it's well-defined and accurately handles cases where memory might need to be released or not.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
}
...
free(ptr);   
```
