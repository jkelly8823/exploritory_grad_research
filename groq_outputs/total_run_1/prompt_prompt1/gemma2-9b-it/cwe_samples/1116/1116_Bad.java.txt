VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer overflow vulnerability due to potential lack of bounds checking.
EXPLANATION: 
The multiplication operation `daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg;` has the potential to result in an integer overflow. 

* Without knowing the maximum allowed value for `pt_weight` and `mg_per_kg`, we can't definitively say an overflow will occur. However, if these values are large enough, their product could exceed the maximum value representable by an `int`.

*  Integer overflow can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior, as the result might wrap around to a negative or unintended value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Input Validation:** Validate the input values for `pt_weight` and `mg_per_kg` to ensure they are within a reasonable range and prevent potential overflows.
2. **Use Larger Data Types:** If the expected range of `daily_dose` could potentially exceed the limits of an `int`, consider using a larger data type such as `long` or `BigInteger` to store the result.
3. **Safe Arithmetic:** Use libraries or functions designed to perform arithmetic operations safely, handling potential overflows and providing appropriate error handling.



ORIGINAL CODE:
               
                 public class Main {
                 
		   public static void main(String[] args) {
                   
		     int pt_weight = 83;
		     int mg_per_kg = 3;
		     int daily_dose = 0;
		     
		     // Add the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose
		     daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg;
                     return dosage;
		   
                   }
		 
                 }
