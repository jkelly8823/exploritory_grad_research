VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The provided code calculates a `daily_dose` by multiplying `pt_weight` and `mg_per_kg`. Depending on the values of `pt_weight` and `mg_per_kg`, the result of this multiplication could potentially exceed the maximum value an integer can hold, leading to an integer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a data type with a larger range to store the `daily_dose`, such as `long` to accommodate potentially large results.
- Perform bounds checking before performing the multiplication to ensure that the result will fit within the integer range.
- Implement safeguards to handle potential overflow conditions, such as logging an error or taking alternative actions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                 public class Main {
                 
		   public static void main(String[] args) {
                   
		     int pt_weight = 83;
		     int mg_per_kg = 3;
		     int daily_dose = 0;
		     
		     // Multiply the patient weight and Mg/Kg to calculate the correct daily dose
		     daily_dose = pt_weight * mg_per_kg;
                     return dosage; 
		   
                   }
		 
                 }
               }
               
               ```
