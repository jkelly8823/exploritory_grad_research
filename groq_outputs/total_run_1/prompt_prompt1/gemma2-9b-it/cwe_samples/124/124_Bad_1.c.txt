VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `strcpy` to copy data from `srcBuf` into `destBuf`.  The issue is that the size of the destination buffer (`destBuf`) is not checked before the copy operation. If `srcBuf` is larger than the remaining space in `destBuf`, `strcpy` will write beyond the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow. 

This buffer overflow could allow an attacker to overwrite critical data, potentially crashing the program or executing malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Bounds Checking:** Always check the size of the destination buffer before using `strcpy`. Ensure that the length of the source string (`srcBuf`) plus the null terminator fits within the available space.  

2. **Safe String Functions:** Consider using safer alternatives to `strcpy` such as `strncpy`, which allows you to specify a maximum number of characters to copy. 

3. **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate user input (`srcBuf`) to prevent it from containing malicious or unexpected data that could cause a buffer overflow.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
  ...
  char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
  int idx = result - destBuf;
  strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
  ...
}
```
