VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name)`, which does not perform any bounds checking. If `hp->h_name` is longer than 64 characters (the size of the `hostname` buffer), it will write past the end of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a safer string copy function like `strncpy(hostname, hp->h_name, sizeof(hostname) - 1)` to explicitly limit the number of characters copied and ensure null termination.
- Ensure that `hp->h_name` is appropriately validated before copying to prevent overly long strings.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
                        struct hostent *hp;in_addr_t *addr;char hostname[64];in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
                           
                           /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */
                           
                           validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
                     }
               }  
```
