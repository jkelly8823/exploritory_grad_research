VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 

The code directly incorporates user input from `request.getParameter("reportName")` into the file path without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the `reportName` parameter to access or delete files outside the intended "/usr/local/apfr/reports/" directory, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Validate and sanitize the `rName` string before using it in the file path. This involves:
    * **Allowlisting:** Only permit a whitelist of safe characters (alphanumeric, underscores, etc.).
    * **Escaping:** Encode potentially dangerous characters to prevent them from being interpreted as directory traversal commands.

2. **Use a Safe File Path Handling Method:**

    * **Java's `File` API:** Consider using `File.separator` to construct the file path safely, ensuring it adheres to the correct directory structure.

3. **Limit Directory Access:**  Restrict the permissions of the "/usr/local/apfr/reports/" directory to prevent unauthorized access.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
                  File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);  
                  ...
                  rFile.delete(); 
```
