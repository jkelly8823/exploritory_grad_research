VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION:

The code snippet demonstrates a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Line 11: `*p = alloca(sizeof(int *));`**  This line attempts to allocate memory on the stack using `alloca()`. The key issue is that `sizeof(int *)` returns the size of a pointer (which is typically 4 or 8 bytes depending on the architecture), but it is being assigned to a pointer `*p` without any bounds check.

* **Line 12: `p = *p;`** This line moves the pointer `p` to the location pointed to by the newly allocated memory. As there's no limit to how many times this loop can execute (based on `end_limit`),  the allocation can quickly exceed the size of the stack, causing a buffer overflow.

**DATA OVERWRITE:** A buffer overflow happens when a program tries to store more data in a buffer (memory location) than it can hold. In this case, the repeatedly allocated pointers can  write beyond the intended space, potentially overwriting critical data on the stack, including function return addresses and other variables.

**Consequences:**

Buffer overflows can lead to various security exploits, including:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could carefully craft input to control the overflow and inject malicious code into the vulnerable part of the program, ultimately taking control of the system.
* **Denial of Service:** Overflowing the stack can corrupt the program's state, causing it to crash or behave unpredictably.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Bound Checking:** Always validate the size of allocated memory and compare it against a known buffer size before writing data. Use `sizeof` to determine the correct buffer size based on the data type.

2. **Static Buffer Allocation:** Consider using dynamically allocated memory (e.g., with `malloc()`) if you need to handle variable-length data. Always free this memory using `free()` when you are finished with it to prevent memory leaks.

3. **Safe Libraries:** Utilize safer memory manipulation libraries when possible, as they often include built-in bounds checking and buffer overflow protection.



     
ORIGINAL CODE:
                    
					  // Gets the size from the number of objects in a database, which over time can conceivably get very large
					  int end_limit = get_nmbr_obj_from_db();
					  int i;
					  int *base = NULL;
					  int *p =base;
					  for (i = 0; i < end_limit; i++)
					  {
					    
					      *p = alloca(sizeof(int *)); // Allocate memory on the stack
					      p = *p; // // Point to the next location to be saved
					    
					    }
