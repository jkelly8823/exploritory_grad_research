VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive Data Leakage 
EXPLANATION: The code directly logs the password (`pass`) in plain text to a log file (`dbmsLog.WriteLine`). This exposes the password to anyone with access to the log file, creating a major security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Hash the Password:**  Before logging, hash the password using a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or scrypt. This makes it significantly harder to derive the original password from the logged data.
2. **Mask or Redact Password:** If hashing is not feasible, you can mask or redact the password in the log. For example, log only the last few characters of the password.
3. **Log Only Necessary Data:**  Consider whether logging the password is truly necessary. If not, remove it from the log entirely.
4. **Secure Log Storage:** Ensure the log file is stored securely with appropriate access controls and permissions.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  pass = GetPassword();...dbmsLog.WriteLine(id + ":" + pass + ":" + type + ":" + tstamp);
               
               ```
