VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Predictable Random Number Generation
EXPLANATION: 
The `SEED` value is a fixed constant. Using a fixed seed in a `Random` object will always produce the same sequence of "random" numbers. This lack of entropy makes it easy for an attacker to predict account IDs, compromising the security of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a more robust random number generator:** Consider using a cryptographic random number generator, such as `SecureRandom`, which obtains randomness from a secure source.
* **Generate a unique seed dynamically:** Instead of using a fixed seed, generate a new, unique seed each time the `generateAccountID` method is called. This could involve using a source of true randomness, such as a hardware random number generator or timing-based randomness. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  private static final long SEED = 1234567890;public int generateAccountID() {Random random = new Random(SEED);return random.nextInt();}
                  ```
