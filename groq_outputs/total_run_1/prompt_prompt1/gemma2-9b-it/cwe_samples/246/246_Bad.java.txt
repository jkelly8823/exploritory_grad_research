VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Socket Handling - Open Socket Without Closing

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet opens a socket (`new Socket(remoteHostname, 3000)`) to a remote server (`remoteHostname`) on port 3000. While it attempts to handle potential exceptions (`catch (Exception e) {...}` ), it does not explicitly close the socket (`sock.close()`) after use. This can lead to a  "resource leak" scenario. 

Open sockets tie up system resources and if they aren't closed properly, they can accumulate over time, potentially causing performance degradation, denial-of-service conditions, or security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Always close sockets:** Explicitly close the socket after you are finished with it using `sock.close()`. This should be done even if an exception occurs during socket operation.

    ```java
    Socket sock = null;
    try {
        sock = new Socket(remoteHostname, 3000);
        // Do something with the socket.
    } finally {
        if (sock != null) {
            try {
                sock.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Log the exception, but don't let it prevent closing.
                System.err.println("Error closing socket: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
    ```


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                        
                           
                           // Perform servlet tasks.
                           ...
                           
                           // Open a socket to a remote server (bad).
                           Socket sock = null;
                           try {
                              sock = new Socket(remoteHostname, 3000);
                                 
                                 // Do something with the socket.
                                 ...
                           } catch (Exception e) {...}
                     }
```
