VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection potential.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet lacks context, but the line `int quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");` raises a potential SQL injection concern if `currentUser` interacts with a database. 

Directly inserting user input (`currentUser.getAttribute("quantity")`) into a database query without proper sanitization allows attackers to manipulate the query and potentially execute malicious SQL code. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data access, or even complete system takeover.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:**
   - Before using `currentUser.getAttribute("quantity")` in a database query, escape or sanitize the value to prevent it from being interpreted as SQL code.  

   - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These techniques separate the data from the SQL commands, effectively preventing injection attacks.

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate the format and range of the input received from `currentUser.getAttribute("quantity")`. Ensure it conforms to the expected data type and limits to prevent unexpected or malicious input.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
...
public static final double price = 20.00;
int quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");
double total = price * quantity;
chargeUser(total);
...
