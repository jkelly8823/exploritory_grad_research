VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet utilizes the input `untrustedListSize` directly to determine the size of the `Widget[]` array.  An attacker could supply a very large negative number for `untrustedListSize`. While the code attempts to handle this with the `if (0 > untrustedListSize)` check and a "die" statement handling a negative value, this does not prevent an integer overflow from occurring when allocating the array. A large negative value could wrap around to a positive value when used in array initialization, potentially leading to access beyond the bounds of the allocated array. This  can result in unintended memory access, crashes, or even code execution.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Bound Checking:** Implement stricter bounds checking for `untrustedListSize`. Validate that the value is within a reasonable range or use a predefined maximum size for the array.
2. **Safe Array Sizing:** Use `Array.newInstance()` in Java (or equivalent mechanisms in other languages) to provide safer bounds checking during array creation.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
    private void buildList(int untrustedListSize) {
        if (0 > untrustedListSize) {
            die("Negative value supplied for list size, die evil hacker!");
        }
        Widget[] list = new Widget[untrustedListSize];
        list[0] = new Widget();
    }
```
