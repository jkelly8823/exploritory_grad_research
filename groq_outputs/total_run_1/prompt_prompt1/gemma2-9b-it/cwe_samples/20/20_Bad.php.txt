VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `$_GET` array (`birthday` and `homepage`) into the output without sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the webpage through the `birthday` and `homepage` parameters. 

Specifically, an attacker could craft a payload in the `homepage` parameter that, when opened by a user's browser, would execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other harmful actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize user input:** Before using the values from `$_GET`, sanitize them to remove potentially harmful characters and prevent script injection. This can be done using HTML encoding functions like `htmlspecialchars()`.
* **Validate input:** Check if the input values meet expected patterns and formats. For example, ensure that the `homepage` value is a valid URL.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$birthday = $_GET['birthday'];$homepage = $_GET['homepage'];echo "Birthday: $birthday<br>Homepage: <a href=$homepage>click here</a>"
?>
```
