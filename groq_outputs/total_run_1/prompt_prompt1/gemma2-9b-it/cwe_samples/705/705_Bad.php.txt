VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the way the `$requestingIP` variable is handled.  While the code attempts to control access based on a whitelist (`$ipAllowList`), the direct use of `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` presents a potential risk. 

An attacker might be able to manipulate the `REMOTE_ADDR` header, potentially  bypassing the whitelist check and accessing unauthorized content. This is particularly concerning if there are any actions besides displaying a message that are linked to the `$status` variable (like database queries or file access).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:**  Do not blindly trust the `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`. Even though you're using a whitelist, sanitize the input to ensure it conforms to a valid IP address format.

2. **Use A Dedicated Authentication Mechanism:** Consider implementing a more robust authentication mechanism instead of relying solely on IP whitelisting. This could involve:
   - Session cookies with unique identifiers
   - API tokens
   - User registration and login systems

3. **Minimize Data Exposure:** Avoid revealing sensitive information (`$status`) solely based on IP address. Separate the application logic to prevent an attacker who can bypass the whitelisting from gaining access to sensitive data.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  $requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
                     ...
                     
                  
                  
               
               ```
