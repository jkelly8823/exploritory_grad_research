VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Uncontrolled System Exit

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a `try...catch` block that catches `ApplicationSpecificException`. However, within the catch block, `System.exit(1)` is called, abruptly terminating the application. This is problematic because:

*  It doesn't allow for graceful error handling or logging. 
*  It can lead to data loss or incomplete operations if the application is in a critical state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Remove `System.exit(1)`:** Instead of immediately exiting, handle the exception appropriately. This could involve logging the error, displaying an error message to the user, or taking other corrective actions.

2. **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Consider using a centralized error handling mechanism to provide a consistent way to deal with exceptions across the application. This could involve logging errors to a dedicated system, using a dedicated error handling class, or implementing a circuit breaker pattern.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());System.exit(1);}}
```
