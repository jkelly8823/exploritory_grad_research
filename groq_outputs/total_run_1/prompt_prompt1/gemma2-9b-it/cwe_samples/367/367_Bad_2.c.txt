VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Dereference of a struct member. 
EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to access the `st_ctime` member of the `struct stat` object `sb` using the `->` operator, which is used for pointers. In this case, `sb` is a struct variable, not a pointer.  The correct way to access struct members is using the dot operator (`.`).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change line 10 from  `printf("file change time: %d\n",sb->st_ctime);` to `printf("file change time: %d\n", sb.st_ctime);`

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  
		    #include <sys/types.h>
		    #include <sys/stat.h>
		    
		    ...
		    
		      struct stat sb;
		      stat("MYFILE.txt",&sb);
		      printf("file change time: %d\n",sb->st_ctime);
		      switch(sb->st_ctime % 2){
		        case 0: printf("Option 1\n"); break;
		        case 1: printf("Option 2\n"); break;
		        default: printf("this should be unreachable?\n"); break;
		      }
