VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential path traversal vulnerability.  The `is_link($filename)` and `readlink($filename)` functions create an opportunity for an attacker to manipulate the `$filename` variable and access files outside of the intended directory.

- Line 8 checks if the provided filename is a symbolic link.
- Line 10 resolves the symbolic link using `readlink($filename)`, potentially leading to a new file path controlled by an attacker.
- Line 11 checks file ownership (`fileowner($filename)`), but if the file path is altered by `readlink`, the ownership check might become ineffective.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate File Paths:** Before resolving a symbolic link or accessing a file, sanitize the `$filename` variable rigorously. This involves:
    - Escaping any potential special characters that could be used for path traversal.
    - Limiting the file path to a predefined, restricted directory.  

2. **Use Secure Path Manipulation Functions:** When resolving symbolic links, consider using functions that explicitly handle path manipulation and prevent traversal outside of safe directories. 

3. **Implement Detailed Access Control:** Ensure that access to files is controlled not only by ownership (`fileowner`) but also by other mechanisms like role-based access control (RBAC) or granular permissions provided by the underlying file system.


ORIGINAL CODE:

                  function readFile($filename){
                        $user = getCurrentUser();
                           
                           //resolve file if its a symbolic link
                           if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
                           if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
                     }
               
}
