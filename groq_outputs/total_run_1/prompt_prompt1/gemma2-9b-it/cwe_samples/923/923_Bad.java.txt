VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unregistered Broadcast receiver

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet registers a `BroadcastReceiver` named `MyReceiver`. However, it lacks a corresponding `unregisterReceiver()` call. This means the `MyReceiver` will remain registered, potentially leading to memory leaks and resource exhaustion if the application is not properly shut down. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Unregister the receiver:** Add a `unregisterReceiver(receiver)` call within a `try-finally` block to ensure the receiver is always unregistered, even if exceptions occur during the process. This can be done in the method that registers the receiver or in a lifecycle method such as `onStop()` or `onDestroy()` of the relevant activity or service.
2. **Context Scope:** Ensure you are using the correct context object to register and unregister the receiver.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
registerReceiver(receiver, filter);    

public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
        destroyUserData(userID);
    }
}
               
```
