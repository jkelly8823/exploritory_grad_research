VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for hardcoded secrets. 
EXPLANATION: 
The `secret_password()` function is likely calling a function that retrieves a hardcoded password hash.  Storing passwords in plain text or easily derived formats is a major security risk.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   **Securely Store Passwords:**  Never hardcode passwords directly into the code. Use a dedicated secret management system (like a Key Vault) or environment variables to store sensitive data.
*   **Proper Hashing:** Ensure that passwords are hashed using a strong, cryptographically secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. Salt each password hash to prevent rainbow table attacks.
*   **Immutable Secrets:** Treat secret passwords as immutable.  If a secret is compromised, it should be rotated immediately.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
                        //Login if hash matches stored hash
                        if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}}
               
```
