VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  
Type Confusion Vulnerability.  The code trusts an object based solely on its class name obtained at runtime. This opens the door to type confusion attacks where an attacker could manipulate the `inputClass` to appear as `TrustedClass`  but actually execute malicious code.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, `inputClass.getClass() == TrustedClass.class`  checks if the runtime type of `inputClass`  matches the `TrustedClass`. The issue is that an attacker could potentially create an object of a malicious class that inherits from `TrustedClass`, or even a class with a name similar to `TrustedClass`, fooling the comparison and gaining unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use robust type validation:**  Instead of relying solely on class equality, perform type-sensitive checks using interfaces or specific methods known to be safe within the trusted class.
2. **Limit trust to verified sources:** Enforce strict input validation and ensure `inputClass`  originates from trusted sources.
3. **Minimize runtime type checks:** Wherever possible, determine the type of objects at compile time to avoid the risk of runtime manipulation.  


ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
if (inputClass.getClass() == TrustedClass.class) {
                        
                           
                           // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
                           
                           
                           // ...
                           
                        
                     }
}
               
            
```
