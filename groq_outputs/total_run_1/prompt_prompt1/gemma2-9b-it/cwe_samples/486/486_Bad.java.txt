VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: **Improper Input Validation**

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. 

It relies on checking the class name (`inputClass.getClass().getName()`) against a hardcoded string `TrustedClassName`. Attackers could potentially construct an object of a different class but with a name identical to `TrustedClassName`, bypassing the check and potentially executing malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:**  Instead of relying solely on the class name, thoroughly sanitize `inputClass` before using it. Validate its properties, methods, and interactions to ensure it behaves as expected.

2. **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant the minimum permissions necessary to `inputClass`. If certain actions are only allowed for trusted classes, implement stricter authorization mechanisms beyond simple class name comparisons.

3. **Dynamic Analysis:** Consider using dynamic analysis techniques to profile the behavior of `inputClass` at runtime. This can help detect anomalies or unexpected actions even if the class name appears legitimate.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
if (inputClass.getClass().getName().equals("TrustedClassName")) {
   // Do something assuming you trust inputClass

   // ...
}
```
