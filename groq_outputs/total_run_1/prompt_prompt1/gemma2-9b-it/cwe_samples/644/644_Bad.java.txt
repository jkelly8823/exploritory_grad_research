VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct Data Injection

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability where untrusted data (`untrustedRawInputData`) is directly inserted into a HTTP response header (`HEADER_NAME`) without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection attacks.

An attacker could manipulate the `untrustedRawInputData` to inject malicious scripts or commands into the header, which could then be executed by the browser or server depending on the specific header used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:** Always sanitize and validate user-supplied input before using it in any part of your application, including headers. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful characters based on the context and expected data type.

2. **Encode Data:** Encode the `untrustedRawInputData` appropriately for use in HTTP headers. This could involve URL encoding or HTML encoding, depending on the specific header.

3. **Use Parameterized Queries (if applicable):** If you're using a database or other system that accepts parameters, utilize parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
response.addHeader(HEADER_NAME, untrustedRawInputData);
);
