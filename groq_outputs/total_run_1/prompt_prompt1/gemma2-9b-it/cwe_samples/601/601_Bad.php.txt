## Vulnerability Assessment 

**VULNERABLE:** YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 1
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:**  Open Redirect Vulnerability
**EXPLANATION:** 
The provided code snippet directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['url']` parameter to construct the redirect URL without any sanitization or validation. This opens the door to an Open Redirect attack. An attacker could manipulate the 'url' parameter and redirect the user to malicious websites, potentially stealing their credentials or compromising their system.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:** 

1. **Sanitize Input:** Implement proper input validation to ensure the `$_GET['url']` parameter only contains valid and safe URLs. This can involve using regular expressions, whitelisting allowed domains, and escaping potentially dangerous characters.

2. **Whitelist Approved URLs:** Instead of accepting any URL, consider whitelisting a list of approved destinations. Only redirect users to URLs present in this list. 

3. **Escape Output:** Escape any user-supplied input before including it in the redirect URL to prevent injection attacks.

**ORIGINAL CODE:**

```php
                  $redirect_url = $_GET['url'];header("Location: " . $redirect_url);
               
);
               
               ```
