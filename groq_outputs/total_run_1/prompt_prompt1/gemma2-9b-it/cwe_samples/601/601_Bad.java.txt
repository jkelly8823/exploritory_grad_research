VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Open Redirect Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code is vulnerable to an Open Redirect attack.  An attacker can manipulate the "url" parameter in the query string to redirect the user to any malicious website.  Since the code directly uses `request.getParameter("url")` without sanitization or validation, it's possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize the URL:** Before using the provided URL, validate and sanitize it to ensure it meets specific criteria (e.g., is a valid domain, starts with "https://" for security, etc.). 

2. **Whitelist Allowed Domains:** Create a whitelist of allowed domains or URLs. Only redirect to URLs that are in the whitelist.
3. **Encode URLs:** Encode the URL using appropriate methods to prevent the injection of malicious characters.
   



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class RedirectServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String query = request.getQueryString();
        if (query.contains("url")) {
            String url = request.getParameter("url");
            response.sendRedirect(url);
        }
    }
}
```
