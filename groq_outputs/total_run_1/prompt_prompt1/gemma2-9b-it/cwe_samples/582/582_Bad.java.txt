VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Code Injection
EXPLANATION: The class name `urlTool`  suggests its purpose is to interact with URLs.  Hardcoding large arrays of URLs directly into the class definition is generally considered bad practice, as it makes the code less flexible and more susceptible to code injection vulnerabilities. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Use a configuration file:** Move the list of URLs to a configuration file (properties, JSON, etc.). This allows for easier modification and updates without recompiling the code.
* **Input validation:** If the URLs are dynamically obtained (e.g., from user input), implement robust input validation to ensure they adhere to a safe format.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public final class urlTool extends Applet {public final static URL[] urls;...}
     
```
