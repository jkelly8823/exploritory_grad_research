VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet reveals hardcoded database credentials within a connection string. Specifically, the username ("db2admin") and password ("password") are directly embedded in the string. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - **NEVER store sensitive information like database credentials directly in your code.** This practice makes your application extremely vulnerable to attacks.
   - **Utilize environment variables:** Store your database credentials in secure environment variables. Retrieve and use these variables within your application instead of hardcoding them.
   - **Configuration files:** Consider using a dedicated configuration file to store sensitive data. This file can be stored separately from your code and protected with appropriate access controls.   
   - **Secrets management systems:** For more robust security, employ a dedicated secrets management system to store and manage your credentials securely. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
