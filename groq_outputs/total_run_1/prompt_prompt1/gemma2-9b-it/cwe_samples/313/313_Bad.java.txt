VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: The code snippet reveals hardcoded username and password values directly within the properties file. This practice is highly insecure as it exposes sensitive authentication information directly in plain text.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data like usernames and passwords in environment variables and retrieve them from the application at runtime.
2. **Configuration Management Tools:** Utilize configuration management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage credentials, allowing for role-based access control and encryption.
3. **Secure File Storage:** If storing credentials in a file is unavoidable, encrypt the file using a strong encryption algorithm and store the encryption key separately.

ORIGINAL CODE:
   
                     # Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
                     ...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...
