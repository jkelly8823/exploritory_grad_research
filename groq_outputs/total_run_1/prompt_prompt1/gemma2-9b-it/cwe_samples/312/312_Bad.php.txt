VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper sanitization of user input

EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses user-supplied `$username` and `$password` values to construct the `$data` array, which is then stored as a cookie using `setcookie()`. This poses a serious security risk, as it allows for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.

Attackers could manipulate the `$username` or `$password` parameters to inject malicious code into the cookie. When the browser later sends this cookie to the server, the injected code could be executed, potentially leading to data breaches, session hijacking, or other harmful actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- **Sanitize User Input:** Always sanitize user-supplied data before using it in any way, especially when storing it in cookies. This involves removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters to prevent the execution of malicious code. You can use appropriate sanitization functions provided by your programming language or library.

- **Hash Passwords:** Never store passwords in plain text.  Hash the password using a strong cryptographic hash function (like bcrypt or Argon2) before storing it in the cookie or database.


ORIGINAL CODE: 


                  function persistLogin($username, $password){$data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);setcookie ("userdata", $data);}
);}
