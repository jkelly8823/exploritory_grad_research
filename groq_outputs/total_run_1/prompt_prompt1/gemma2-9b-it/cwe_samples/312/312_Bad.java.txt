VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet directly adds user input (`acctID`) into a `Cookie` without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `acctID` variable, which would then be stored in a cookie and executed by the user's browser when they visit subsequent pages.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Always sanitize user-supplied data before using it in cookies or any other sensitive part of your application. Use established libraries or methods to escape special characters that could be used for injecting malicious code. For example, you can use `escapeHtml()` or a similar function to escape HTML characters in the `acctID` value.

2. **Validate Input:** Implement input validation to ensure that `acctID` meets your application's expected format and length. This can help prevent attackers from injecting unexpected or malicious data.

3. **Use a Templating Engine:** Consider using a templating engine that provides built-in security mechanisms for escaping data before it is rendered in HTML.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
response.addCookie( new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID); 
```
