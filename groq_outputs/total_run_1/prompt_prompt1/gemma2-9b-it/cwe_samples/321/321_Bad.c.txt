VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded password
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores the administrator password as a string literal. This is a severe vulnerability as attackers can easily find and use this hardcoded password to gain unauthorized access. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Store passwords securely:** Never hardcode passwords directly into the code. Instead, use a secure method like hashing and salting to store passwords. 
2. **Use environment variables:** For sensitive data like passwords, consider storing it in environment variables, which can be set at runtime and are not directly visible in the code.  
3. **Configuration files:** Store sensitive information in external configuration files that are not committed to version control.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (strcmp(password,"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {
      printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0);
    }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
  }
}   
```
