VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Password

EXPLANATION: 
The code directly stores the administrative password in plain text within the `VerifyAdmin` function. This poses a severe security risk as any individual with access to the code can easily determine the password. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Store passwords securely:**  Do not hardcode passwords directly into your code. Instead, use a secure hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) to store passwords in a database. 
    * Hash the password received during authentication using the chosen algorithm. 
    * Compare the hash of the entered password with the stored hash.

2. **Use environment variables:** If you need to store sensitive information like passwords temporarily during development or testing, consider using environment variables. Ensure these environment variables are not committed to version control.
   * Read the password from an environment variable instead of using a hardcoded value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                     int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.Equals("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {Console.WriteLine("Entering Diagnostic Mode...");return(1);}Console.WriteLine("Incorrect Password!");return(0);}
