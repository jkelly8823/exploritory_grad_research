VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES:  3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Password
EXPLANATION: The code directly stores the administrative password ("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b") in plain text. This makes the password easily accessible to anyone who can view the code, creating a significant security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Never store passwords in plain text.
* Use a secure password hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) to hash the password before storing it. 
* Implement proper authentication mechanisms, ideally using a dedicated database or secure storage system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public boolean VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.equals("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {
System.out.println("Entering Diagnostic Mode...");return true;}
System.out.println("Incorrect Password!");return false;
                  
               
               ```
