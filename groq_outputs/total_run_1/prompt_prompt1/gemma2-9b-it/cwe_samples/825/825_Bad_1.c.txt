VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Double Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code demonstrates a classic double free vulnerability.  The `free(ptr);` statement on the second line will attempt to free the memory pointed to by `ptr` even if the `if (abrt)` condition is false. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior. Double freeing memory can corrupt the heap and potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
   
* **Move the `free(ptr)` statement inside the `if (abrt)` block:**  This ensures that the memory is freed only if necessary. Remove the  outside `free(ptr)`. 
    ```c
    char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
    ...
    if (abrt) {
      free(ptr);
    }
    ```



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
               ```
