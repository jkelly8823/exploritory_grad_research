VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Missing Close of Temporary File
EXPLANATION:  The code opens a temporary file using `tmpfile()` but doesn't properly close it. This can lead to a `memory leak` where the file descriptor remains open, consuming system resources. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Close the temporary file:** Add a call to `fclose(stream)` before `tmpfile()`.

   ```c
   FILE *stream;
   if ((stream = tmpfile()) == NULL) {
       perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");
       return (-1);
   }
   // write data to tmp file
   ... 
   fclose(stream); // Close the temp file
   remove("temp_file"); // Remove the temp file
   ```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  FILE *stream;
                  if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {
                        perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");
                        return (-1);
                  }
                  // write data to tmp file
                  ...
                  // remove tmp file
                  remove("temp_file");
   ```
