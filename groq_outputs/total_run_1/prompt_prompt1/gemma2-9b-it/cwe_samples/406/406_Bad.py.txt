VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unbound Loop Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
The code contains an unbounded `while True:` loop. This means the loop will run indefinitely, consuming system resources and potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition if the code processing each iteration is not fast enough or an external factor disrupts the code's ability to receive input.  There's no clear exit condition besides the `if not data:` break statement.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Add a Timeout:** Introduce a mechanism to interrupt the loop after a specific duration if no data is received. This can prevent the loop from running indefinitely.
2. **Bounded Loop:**  Instead of `while True:`, use a more controlled loop, like `while counter < MAX_ATTEMPTS:` or  `while time < TIMEOUT:` .

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                  sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)sock.bind( (UDP_IP,UDP_PORT) )
                  while true:
                        data = sock.recvfrom(1024)
                        if not data:
                                break
                           (requestIP, nameToResolve) = parseUDPpacket(data)
                           record = resolveName(nameToResolve)
                           sendResponse(requestIP,record)
                     
                  
                  
               
               ```
