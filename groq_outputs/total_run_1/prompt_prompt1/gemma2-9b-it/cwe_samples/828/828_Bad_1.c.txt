VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The `sh` function frees memory pointed to by `global1` and `global2` using `free(global2)` and `free(global1)`.  There's a risk that these memory locations might be accessed after they've been freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Careful Memory Management:** Ensure that `global1` and `global2` are not accessed after they have been freed.  

    * A safer approach is to use a mechanism to track whether the memory has been freed, such as setting a flag.
2. **Avoid Implicitly Freeing Memory in Signal Handlers:** Signal handlers are often called asynchronously. Freeing memory in a signal handler can lead to unpredictable behavior if the freed memory is still in use elsewhere. 
    * Consider using a more robust strategy for handling cleanup tasks, such as a dedicated thread or a cleanup function that is explicitly called when necessary.  




ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  #include <signal.h>#include <syslog.h>#include <string.h>#include <stdlib.h>
                     void *global1, *global2;char *what;void sh (int dummy) {
                        syslog(LOG_NOTICE,"%s\n",what);free(global2);free(global1);
                           /* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */
                           
                           sleep(10);exit(0);
                     }
                     int main (int argc,char* argv[]) {
                        what=argv[1];global1=strdup(argv[2]);global2=malloc(340);signal(SIGHUP,sh);signal(SIGTERM,sh);
                           /* Sleep statements added to expand timing window for race condition */
                           
                           sleep(10);exit(0);
                     }
               
               ```
