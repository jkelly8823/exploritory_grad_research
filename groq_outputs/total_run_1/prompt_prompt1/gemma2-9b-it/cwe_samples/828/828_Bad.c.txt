VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Use-After-Free Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code exhibits a potential use-after-free vulnerability. In the `handler` function, `logMessage` is freed using `free(logMessage)`. However, the code then attempts to print `logMessage` using `syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "%s\n", logMessage)`.  After freeing the memory, it's no longer valid to access `logMessage`.  Attempting to use it in this way leads to undefined behavior, which could result in a crash or allow an attacker to compromise the program.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Delayed Freeing:** Avoid freeing `logMessage` until after it's no longer needed within the `handler` function.  
2. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to check the return value of `strdup()` and handle potential allocation failures.
3. **Proper Memory Management:** Utilize a memory management library or carefully track memory allocations and deallocations to prevent memory leaks and use-after-free vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
char *logMessage;

void handler (int sigNum) {
   syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "%s\n", logMessage);
   free(logMessage);
   /* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */

   sleep(10);
   exit(0);
}
int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
   logMessage = strdup(argv[1]);
   /* Register signal handlers. */

   signal(SIGHUP, handler);
   signal(SIGTERM, handler);
   /* artificially increase the size of the timing window to make demonstration of this weakness easier. */

   sleep(10);
}
```
