VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The variable `test_string` is declared as a character pointer, but its size is not explicitly defined. If `printf("%s", test_string);` is called when `test_string` points to a location in memory that does not have enough space to hold the "Hello World!" string, it can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially causing a crash or security exploit. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Allocate Memory:** Dynamically allocate memory for `test_string` using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`, ensuring it is large enough to accommodate the "Hello World!" string plus a null terminator.

2. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking before using `printf()`. Ensure that the length of the string being printed is within the allocated memory bounds of `test_string`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                char *test_string;
                if (i != err_val)
                {
                test_string = "Hello World!";
                }
                printf("%s", test_string);
              );
              
              ```
