VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Path Traversal 
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly concatenates user input (`$Username`) with a file path without proper sanitization. This creates a vulnerability where a malicious user could manipulate the input to access files outside the intended directory ("/home/user/").

For example, if a user inputs ".." they could potentially access files like "/home/user/../../etc/passwd" .

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   **Sanitize user input rigorously:** Validate and escape user-provided `$Username`  to prevent directory traversal attacks.  
*   **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements:** If interacting with a database, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

*   **Validate file paths:** Implement checks to ensure that the constructed `$filename` only points to valid locations within the authorized directory structure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/^\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename); 
```
