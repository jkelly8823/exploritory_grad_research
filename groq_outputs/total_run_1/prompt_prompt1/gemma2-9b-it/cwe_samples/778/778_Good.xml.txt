VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Log File Disclosure

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet configures a service's audit logging behavior.  Specifically, the `auditLogLocation="Default"` setting indicates that audit logs will be written to the default location.  While not inherently malicious, this configuration could potentially lead to a log file disclosure vulnerability if the default log location is not properly protected. An attacker might be able to access these logs, potentially revealing sensitive information like usernames, timestamps, or even sensitive data processed by the service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Secure the Log Location:** Do not use the default log location. Specify a secure location for audit logs, ensuring it is not publicly accessible and has appropriate access controls.

2. **Review Log Content:** Carefully review the types of information being logged and consider removing or masking any sensitive data that should not be recorded.

3. **Implement Secure Transport:** If feasible, use a secure transport mechanism (e.g., HTTPS) for transmitting audit logs to a central logging system.
