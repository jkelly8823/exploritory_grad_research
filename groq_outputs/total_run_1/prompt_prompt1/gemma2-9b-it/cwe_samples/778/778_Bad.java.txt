VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Possible Infinite Loop Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet lacks a clear exit condition within the `LoginRetry()` function. If `LoginRetry()` itself doesn't ultimately succeed in authentication, the program might enter an infinite loop, continuously calling `LoginRetry()` without ever reaching a successful login. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Implement a Limit on Login Attempts:** Introduce a counter to track the number of unsuccessful login attempts. After a certain number of failures, display an appropriate error message or take alternative actions (e.g., lockout temporarily) instead of recursively calling `LoginRetry()`.

2. **Check for Success Before Recursion:** Modify `LoginRetry()` to explicitly check if the login was successful before calling itself again.

3. **Error Handling:** Ensure `LoginRetry()` handles potential errors during the login process gracefully.  



ORIGINAL CODE:

```
                  if LoginUser(){
                     // Login successful
		     RunProgram();
                  } else {
                     // Login unsuccessful
		     LoginRetry();
                  }
               
```
