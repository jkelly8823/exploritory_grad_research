VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Exposure of Sensitive Information (Azure Account Key)
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly includes the Azure account key in the command. This is a severe security vulnerability as it exposes sensitive credentials in plain text.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Never hardcode secrets like Azure account keys directly into your code.** 
* **Use environment variables:** Store your Azure account key in an environment variable and reference it in your command using  `$(<environment variable name>)`.
* **Configuration Files:**  Utilize a secure configuration file (e.g., .env, JSON, YAML) to store sensitive information and load it into your script. 
* **Azure Key Vault:** For production environments, employ Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage your Azure account keys. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```bash
az storage logging update --account-name --account-key --services b --log rwd --retention 90	
```
