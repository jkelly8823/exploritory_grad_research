VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Storage Account Key
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet directly exposes your Azure storage account key in plain text. This is a serious security vulnerability as anyone with access to the code or the execution environment can read and misuse the key, granting them unauthorized access to your storage account. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  

* **Do not hardcode credentials in your code.**  
* **Use environment variables:** Store your storage account key securely in an environment variable and access it within your code. 
* **Consider using Azure managed identities:**  Leverage Azure managed identities to authenticate your applications directly with Azure services without needing to store secrets in your code.
ORIGINAL CODE:
                  
```
az storage logging update --account-name --account-key --services b --log d --retention 90 
```
