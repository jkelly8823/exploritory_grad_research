VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Configuration 
EXPLANATION:  The provided code snippet shows part of a configuration file for a .NET service.  The `<serviceSecurityAudit>` element has its `serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel` and `messageAuthenticationAuditLevel` set to "None". This disables auditing for both service authorization and message authentication.  


Turning off auditing can make it significantly harder to detect and investigate security breaches. Attackers could potentially access or modify service resources without leaving an audit trail.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Re-enable Auditing:** Set `serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel` and `messageAuthenticationAuditLevel` to at least "Full". This will create a detailed log of all authorization attempts and message authentication successes/failures, helping you identify suspicious activity.
2. **Review Audit Log Location:**  The `auditLogLocation` is set to "Default". Ensure this location is secure and properly configured to store audit logs. Consider using a centralized logging system for better management and analysis.
