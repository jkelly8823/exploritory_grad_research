VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Weak Encryption Algorithm
EXPLANATION: The code uses the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm. DES is considered a weak encryption algorithm and is no longer recommended for use due to its susceptibility to brute-force attacks. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: Replace the DES algorithm with a stronger, more secure encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). 
ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  Cipher des=Cipher.getInstance("DES...");des.initEncrypt(key2);
