VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of a weak ciphering mode (ECB)
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet utilizes `EVP_des_ecb()`, which employs the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode for DES encryption. ECB mode is known to be highly vulnerable to various attacks, such as known-plaintext attacks and chosen-plaintext attacks, rendering it insecure for sensitive data protection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace `EVP_des_ecb()` with a more secure ciphering mode, such as Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Counter (CTR), or Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
                  EVP_des_ecb()
```
