VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of MCRYPT_MODE_ECB for encryption, which is vulnerable to a known plaintext attack.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `mcrypt_encrypt` with `MCRYPT_MODE_ECB` mode. ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode is a very insecure encryption mode. It suffers from a known plaintext attack, where an attacker can decrypt the ciphertext if they have access to the plaintext of a previous message.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a stronger encryption mode such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or CTR (Counter). Also, consider using a more modern cryptographic library like openssl.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function encryptPassword($password){
  $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_DES, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
  $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
  $key = "This is a password encryption key";
  $encryptedPassword = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $password, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv);
  return $encryptedPassword;
}
```
