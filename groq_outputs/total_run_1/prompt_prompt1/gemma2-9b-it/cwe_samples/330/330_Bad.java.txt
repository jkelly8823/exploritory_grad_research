VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Random Number Generation
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `Random.nextInt(400000000)` to generate a random number for the receipt URL. While seemingly random, this approach is vulnerable because it's seed based on the current time. 
   
This means that if an attacker can predict the time the code will run, or if the code executes at a predictable interval, they can potentially predict the generated random number and craft a predictable receipt URL.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
 1. **Use a Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator:** Employ a stronger random number generator like `java.security.SecureRandom` to ensure the generated numbers are truly random and not susceptible to prediction.  

2. **Proper Seed Initialization:** If using `Random`, initialize it with a cryptographically secure source other than the current time to  make it more difficult for an attacker to predict subsequent random numbers.


ORIGINAL CODE: 
```java
                  String GenerateReceiptURL(String baseUrl) {Random ranGen = new Random();ranGen.setSeed((new Date()).getTime());return(baseUrl + ranGen.nextInt(400000000) + ".html");}
               
}
               
               
```
