VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 8, 10, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly hardcodes the secret key and certificate file paths as well as a potentially hardcoded default password within the code, making it highly vulnerable to exploitation.

RECOMMMENDATIONS:
1. **Move Sensitive Data to Environment Variables:**  Instead of embedding secrets directly into the code, store them in environment variables. This allows for secure management and updates without modifying the core codebase.

2. **Use Secure Configuration Files:**  Consider using a dedicated configuration file to store sensitive information like file paths and passwords. This file can be kept separate from the source code and protected with appropriate access controls.

3. **Avoid Hardcoding Passwords:**  Never hardcode passwords, especially default passwords, directly into your code. This is a major security risk. Implement robust password management practices, such as using secure password hashing and salt.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #define CERT "secret.pem"#define CERT2 "secret2.pem"
                     int main(){
                        SSL_CTX *ctx;SSL *ssl;init_OpenSSL();seed_prng();
                           ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_method());
                           if (SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(ctx, CERT) != 1)int_error("Error loading certificate from file");
                           
                           if (SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, CERT, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != 1)int_error("Error loading private key from file");
                           
                           if (!(ssl = SSL_new(ctx)))int_error("Error creating an SSL context");
                           
                           if ( SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb(ctx, "new default password" != 1))int_error("Doing something which is dangerous to do anyways");
                           
                           if (!(ssl2 = SSL_new(ctx)))int_error("Error creating an SSL context");
