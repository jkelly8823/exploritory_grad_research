VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a logic error due to incorrect comparison operator.
EXPLANATION: 
The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {` uses the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the comparison operator (`==`). This means the code is assigning the result of `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` to the variable `cert` instead of comparing it. This will always evaluate to true, leading to the code inside the `if` block executing regardless of the actual value returned by `SSL_get_peer`.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Change the comparison operator from `=` to `==` :

```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))) { 
   //logic here
} 
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
                        foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))
                              
                                 
                                 //do stuff
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               ```
