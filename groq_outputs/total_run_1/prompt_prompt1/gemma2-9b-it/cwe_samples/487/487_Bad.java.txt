VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Incorrect Keyword Usage and Potential Typos

EXPLANATION: 
   - The code declares `package math;`  followed by `public class Lebesgue implements Integration{...}`. This Java syntax is generally correct for defining a class within a package.
   - However, there's a mistake in `public final Static String youAreHidingThisFunction(functionToIntegrate){`.
     *  "Static" should be lowercase (i.e., `static`).
     *  Parentheses `()` following a method name are generally reserved for parameters. 
     *  The method name `youAreHidingThisFunction` is  non-standard and might suggest hiding sensitive information unfavorably.

*  Returning "... "  in the context of a method likely means the code hasn't been fully implemented. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Correct Keyword:**  Change `public final Static` to `public final static`.
2. **Review Method Name:**  Choose a more descriptive and conventional method name. 
3. **Implement Logic:** Provide a valid return value instead of "...". This could be based on the `functionToIntegrate` parameter.  


ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  package math;public class Lebesgue implements Integration{
                        public final Static String youAreHidingThisFunction(functionToIntegrate){
                              
                                 return ...;
                           }
                     }
               
}
