VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the use of an unchecked href attribute. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the href attribute, which would then be executed in the user's browser when they click the link.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize User Input:** Ensure that the link URL is sanitized before being used in the href attribute. This involves removing or escaping any potentially harmful characters. Use a dedicated library or function for sanitizing URLs.
* **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded on your website. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
* **Encode HTML:** Encode the HTML output of any user-generated content, including the link's target attribute.



ORIGINAL CODE:

```html
                  <a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
               
               ">
               
               
               
               
```
