VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential
EXPLANATION:  The vulnerability lies in the use of `window.open()`  with a URL potentially controlled by an attacker.  If `http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html`  contains malicious JavaScript, it could be executed when the new window loads. 

   The line `newWindow.opener = null;` attempts to prevent the user from going back to the original page, potentially making it harder for them to notice the malicious activity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Sanitize Input:** Never directly use user-provided data in URLs opened using `window.open()`.  Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.

2.  **Use a Whitelist:** Create a whitelist of allowed URLs that are permitted to be opened in new windows. Any URL outside this list should be blocked.

3.  **Avoid `opener = null;`:** Although this line aims to hinder navigation back to the original page, it doesn't guarantee security. It's better to focus on preventing the malicious code injection in the first place.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");newWindow.opener = null;
```
