VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code uses `window.open()` to open a new window pointing to a URL `http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html`.  This presents a vulnerability if the URL is under attacker control. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into that URL, which would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the new window opens.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize user-supplied URLs:**  Never directly use user-supplied data in `window.open()`. Always sanitize the URL to remove any potentially harmful JavaScript code. Use a robust URL sanitization library or technique appropriate for the context.

* **Consider using alternative methods:**  Depending on your application's needs, explore alternative methods for opening links that offer more control and security. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
```
