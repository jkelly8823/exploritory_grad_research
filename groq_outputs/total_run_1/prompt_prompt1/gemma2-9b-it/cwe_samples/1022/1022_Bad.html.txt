VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `<a href>` tag utilizes an empty string as the link text.  Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into this empty space, which would be executed in the context of the user's browser when they click the link. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Never directly insert user-supplied data into HTML attributes like `href`. Sanitize any input to remove potentially harmful characters or script elements.

2. **Encode Special Characters:** If you must display user input within HTML, encode special characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML code.

3. **Use a Templating Engine:** Consider using a templating engine that automatically escapes user input for output, reducing the risk of XSS.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```html
                  <a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">">
                
               ```
