VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for race condition.
EXPLANATION:
The assignment of `grant_access` and the subsequent conditional assignment of `data_out` are happening in a single `always` block triggered on the rising edge of `clk` or the falling edge of `rst_n`. If a change in `usr_id` occurs very quickly after `grant_access` is calculated but before `data_out` is updated, it could lead to a race condition where `data_out` might not reflect the latest `usr_id` value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Synchronize `usr_id`**: Consider using a registered copy of `usr_id` within the `always` block, updated synchronously with the input `usr_id`. This ensures that the `grant_access` calculation always reflects the latest valid `usr_id`.

2. **Add a `nonblocking` assignment**: Replace the assignment of `data_out` with `nonblocking` assignment (using `<=`) to avoid the potential for a simultaneous race condition.


ORIGINAL CODE:
       			      always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
       			      begin
			      
				if (!rst_n)
				
				  data_out = 0;
				
				else
				
				  assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
				  data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
				
			      
			      end
       			      endmodule
