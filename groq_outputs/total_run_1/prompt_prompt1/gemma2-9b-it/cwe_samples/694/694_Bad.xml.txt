VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate form definition

EXPLANATION:

The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability due to the duplication of the `<form name="ProjectForm">` element within a `<formset>` component. 

While the exact interpretation depends on the specific framework or library being used, this repetition likely indicates an error.  Form handling systems typically rely on unique identifiers to manage and process form data. Having duplicate form names with the same content can lead to:

- **Data Handling Errors:** It's unclear which form data will be submitted or processed, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or data loss.
- **Framework Inconsistencies:**  The framework might not be able to handle this duplication gracefully, leading to errors or unexpected form rendering.
- **Security Risks (in some cases):** Depending on the context, duplicate forms could be exploited in limited scenarios to bypass intended validation or submission rules.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Ensure Form Uniqueness:** Each form within a `<formset>` should have a distinct name. Modify the code to ensure that each `<form>` has a unique identifier, such as:

   ```html
   <form name="ProjectFormA"> ... </form>
   <form name="ProjectFormB"> ... </form>
   ```

2. **Review Framework Documentation:**  Consult the documentation for the specific form handling framework or library you are using to ensure you understand the correct usage and potential pitfalls of multiple forms.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
				   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
				 
               
               ```
