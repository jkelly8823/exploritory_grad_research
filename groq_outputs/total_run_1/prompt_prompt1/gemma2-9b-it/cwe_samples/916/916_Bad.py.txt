VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Using MD5 for password hashing is considered highly insecure. MD5 is a collision-prone hash function, meaning that different passwords could produce the same hash, leading to potential security breaches. 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code uses the `hashlib.md5` function to hash passwords. Unfortunately, MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that is known to be vulnerable to collisions. This means that it's possible for two different passwords to produce the same MD5 hash, allowing an attacker to potentially impersonate a user. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Replace MD5 with a more secure hashing algorithm**:  Use a cryptographic hash function like bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt. These algorithms are specifically designed to be resistant to collision attacks and are considered more secure for password hashing.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
                  def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                        
                        # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                        return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
                  
               
               
               
               
        ```
