VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Weak Password Hashing with Hardcoded Salt

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code utilizes the MD5 hashing algorithm to store passwords, a highly deprecated and insecure practice. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning different passwords could produce the same hash, compromising security. Furthermore, the salt used is hardcoded as 'SaltGoesHere', introducing a significant vulnerability. An attacker could potentially discover this hardcoded salt and craft passwords that hash to match existing ones, effectively bypassing the password system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Replace MD5 with a more robust hashing algorithm:**  Use algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt, which are designed to be resistant to collision attacks and have significantly higher computational cost, making them much harder to crack.

2. **Generate unique and unpredictable salts for each user:**  Ensure each user has a unique salt that is randomly generated and stored securely along with their hashed password. This prevents attackers from brute-forcing the salt and recovering passwords.

3. **Consider using a password hashing library:** Leverage existing libraries like `bcrypt` or `argon2` in Python, which provide efficient and secure password hashing functions with built-in features for salt generation and secure storage.



ORIGINAL CODE:
 ```python
                  def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)
                        hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                        
                        # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                        return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
                  
               
               ```
