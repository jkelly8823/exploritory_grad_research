VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the calculation of the buffer size (`len`). The value of `a` (5) is subtracted from `b` (6), resulting in `len` being -1.  

Arrays in C are zero-indexed, meaning a buffer with a negative size is impossible. This leads to undefined behavior. When attempting to write data to `buf`, which has a size determined by `len`, the program will likely write beyond the allocated memory for `buf`, overwriting other parts of the stack. This can lead to program crashes, unexpected behavior, or even security exploits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate Input:** Ensure the values of `a` and `b` are within a safe range and cannot lead to negative buffer sizes.
2. **Safe Buffer Size Calculation:** Check the result of the size calculation (`a - b`) to make sure it's non-negative before using it to allocate the buffer. Consider using `sizeof(char) * std::max(0, a - b)` to ensure a valid buffer size even if the original calculation resulted in a negative value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
		    int a = 5, b = 6;
		    size_t len = a - b;
		    char buf[len];    // Just blows up the stack
```
