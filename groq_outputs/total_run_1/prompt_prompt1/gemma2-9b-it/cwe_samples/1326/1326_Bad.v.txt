VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential out-of-bounds memory access.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows memory access using `mem[raddr_q]`.  
The condition  `raddr_q < RomSize` is used but  
- `raddr_q` is calculated based on `addr_i`, which might not be within the bounds of `RomSize`. 
- There's no explicit check to ensure that `raddr_q` is within the valid memory address range of `mem`. 

If `raddr_q` exceeds `RomSize`, this will lead to an out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing a crash or security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Verify that `addr_i` is always within the valid range for `RomSize` before calculating `raddr_q`.
-  Implement additional bounds checking on `raddr_q`.  For example, ensure `raddr_q` is within the range [0, RomSize-1] before accessing `mem`. You can modify the code as follows:

```verilog
always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
    if (req_i) begin
        if (!we_i) begin
            raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3]; 
        end else begin
            mem[addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3]] <= wdata_i;
        end
    end
end

// Modify the assign statement for rdata_o
assign rdata_o = (0 <= raddr_q && raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0; 
``` 



ORIGINAL CODE:
						...
                            always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
                                if (req_i) begin
                                    if (!we_i) begin
										raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];
										end else begin
										mem[addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3]] <= wdata_i;
										end
									end
								end
                        	...
							
								// this prevents spurious Xes from propagating into the speculative fetch stage of the core
							
							assign rdata_o = (raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;
							...
