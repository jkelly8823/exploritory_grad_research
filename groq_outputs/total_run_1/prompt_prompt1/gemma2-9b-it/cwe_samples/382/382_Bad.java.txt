VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Uncontrolled System Exit

EXPLANATION:
The code catches `ApplicationSpecificException` and immediately calls `System.exit(1)`. This abruptly terminates the application, potentially leaving resources unmanaged and data in an inconsistent state. In a production environment, this can lead to service disruptions and data loss. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Avoid using `System.exit(1)` in error handling. 
* Log the error and its details thoroughly.
* Consider alternative actions like:
    * Rolling back transactions.
    * Shutting down gracefully (e.g., using a shutdown hook).
    * Implementing a failover mechanism.
    * Returning a meaningful HTTP error code to the client. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
  try {
    // ... request processing code ...
  } catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
    logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
    System.exit(1);
  }
}
```
