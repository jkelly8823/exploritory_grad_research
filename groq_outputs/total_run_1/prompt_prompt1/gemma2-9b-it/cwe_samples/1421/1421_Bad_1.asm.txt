VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Possible Memory Access Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION:
Line 6 performs a load operation (`LDR X5, [X6,X3]`) where the offset `X3` is calculated and added to the base address `X6`. If `X6` is an EL0 base address and `X3` is not carefully controlled, this could lead to a memory access outside the bounds of a valid memory region. This is a potential buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read vulnerability. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize `X3`:** Before using `X3` in the offset calculation, ensure its value is within a safe range. You might need to perform bounds checking or limit the value based on the expected size of the data structure pointed to by `X6`.
* **Input Validation (If Applicable):** If `X3` is derived from user input, validate the input rigorously to prevent malicious values that could lead to unexpected memory accesses.

				  5 AND X3, X3, #0xFC0
				  6 LDR X5, [X6,X3] ; X6 is an EL0 base address
