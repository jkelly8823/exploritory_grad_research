VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Memory Disclosure Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
Lines 4 reads a byte from the memory location pointed to by `rcx`.  Without proper bounds checking or addressing limitations, this could lead to reading from arbitrary kernel memory, potentially disclosing sensitive information.  

The code uses a "retry" loop and a conditional jump (`jz retry`) to repeatedly attempt to read data until a non-zero value is encountered. This behavior suggests an attempt to probe for memory locations containing interesting data.

The data read is then multiplied by a page size (4KB) and used to index into the `rbx` pointer, indicating the use of a cache covert channel.  This channel transmits the outcome of the memory read potentially to an attacker in a hidden way.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
-  Add rigorous bounds checking to ensure that `rcx` always points within a valid memory range.
-  Limit the number of retries to prevent excessive memory access attempts.
-  Avoid the use of cache covert channels, as these can be exploited for sensitive information leakage.
-  Sanitize any input used to determine the memory address `rcx` to prevent out-of-bounds access or malicious manipulation.



ORIGINAL CODE:
				  1 ; rcx = kernel address, rbx = probe array
				  2 xor rax, rax                # set rax to 0
				  3 retry:
				  4 mov al, byte [rcx]          # attempt to read kernel memory
				  5 shl rax, 0xc                # multiply result by page size (4KB)
				  6 jz retry                    # if the result is zero, try again
				  7 mov rbx, qword [rbx + rax]  # transmit result over a cache covert channel
