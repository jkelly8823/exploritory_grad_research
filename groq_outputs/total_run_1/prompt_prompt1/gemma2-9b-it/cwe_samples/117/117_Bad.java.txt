VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet takes user input from the `request.getParameter("val")` and attempts to parse it as an integer. Without proper sanitization, an attacker could provide malicious SQL code within the `val` parameter.  This code could then be executed by the `Integer.parseInt()` function, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before parsing the input, thoroughly sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or SQL code. 
   - Use a library designed for input validation, such as Apache Commons Validator.
   - Escape special characters that could be interpreted as SQL code. 
2. **Prepared Statements:** Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries, use prepared statements. Prepared statements treat user input as data, not code, preventing malicious injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String val = request.getParameter("val");
try {
   int value = Integer.parseInt(val);
} catch (NumberFormatException) {
   log.info("Failed to parse val = " + val);
} ... 
```
