VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Output Encoding  
EXPLANATION:
The code uses `input.replaceAll("script", mask)` to sanitize user input. However, this is inadequate for preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Simply replacing "script" is not sufficient, as attackers can use various other ways to inject malicious scripts. 

Here's why this is problematic:

* **Limited Pattern Matching:**  Attackers can use different variations of script tags or exploit other HTML/JavaScript elements to inject malicious code. 
* **No Contextual Understanding:** The code doesn't analyze the context of the input string. A legitimate occurrence of "script" might be part of a valid HTML tag, and the replacement could break the intended functionality.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a dedicated library or framework designed for proper HTML/JavaScript escaping and sanitization. For example:

* **Apache Commons Lang:** Provides the `StringEscapeUtils` class for encoding special characters.
* **OWASP Encoder:** A comprehensive set of encoding libraries.

Ensure the `mask` variable is also properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public String preventXSS(String input, String mask) {return input.replaceAll("script", mask);}
               );} 
```
