VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it directly injects user-supplied data from the `request.getParameter("streetAddress")` into the log message without sanitizing it. An attacker could provide malicious JavaScript code in the "streetAddress" parameter, which would then be executed by the server and potentially injected into the webpage viewed by other users.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before using the `streetAddress` parameter in the log message, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript code. You can use a dedicated library or a combination of techniques like HTML escaping, encoding, or whitelisting allowed characters.
2. **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements:** If you are using a database, avoid directly embedding user input into SQL queries. Instead, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, which can also be exploited in conjunction with XSS.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
logger.info("User's street address: " + request.getParameter("streetAddress"));
```
