VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Integer Overflow vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet lacks bounds checking for the `withdrawAmount` variable. While it sets limits for withdrawal, it doesn't prevent a potentially extreme value that could lead to integer overflow if `withdrawAmount` is excessively large.  

Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a number that is too large to be represented by the data type used. In this case, if a very large `withdrawAmount` is supplied (exceeding the maximum representable value for an `int`), the result could wrap around to a negative value or unexpected unintended result. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a Data Type with Sufficient Range:** Consider using a data type like `long` or a custom numeric representation that can handle a wider range of values to minimize the risk of overflow.
2. **Input Validation:** Implement stricter input validation to ensure that the `withdrawAmount` is within a reasonable and defined range.

                           public final int MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 0;public final int MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT = 350;
                           ...
                           
                           // method to withdraw amount from BankAccount
                           public void withdraw(double withdrawAmount) {
                              
                                 if (withdrawAmount < MAXIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT &&withdrawAmount > MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT) {
                                    
                                       ...
