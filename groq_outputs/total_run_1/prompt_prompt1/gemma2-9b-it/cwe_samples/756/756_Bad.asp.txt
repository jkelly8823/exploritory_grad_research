VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Sensitive Information Disclosure

EXPLANATION:
The `<customErrors mode="Off" />` configuration disables the custom error handling mechanism in ASP.NET. When set to "Off", the server will directly expose unhandled exception details to the client, potentially revealing sensitive information such as database queries, internal server errors, and file paths. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Enable custom error handling with specific error messages:**
   Change `mode="Off"` to `mode="On"` and configure custom error messages to display generic and non-revealing information to the user.

* **Use a logging mechanism:** Implement a robust logging system to capture detailed error information separately from the user-facing output.  This allows for debugging and analysis without exposing sensitive data.
