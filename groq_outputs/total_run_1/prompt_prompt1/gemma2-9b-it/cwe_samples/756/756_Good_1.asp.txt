VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
EXPLANATION: The `defaultRedirect` attribute in the `<customErrors>` tag allows an attacker to specify a URL to redirect to. If this URL is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially use it to perform an SSRF attack. 

The attacker could craft a malicious redirect URL that points to an internal server or service, potentially allowing them to:

* Access sensitive information.
* Execute commands on the server.
* Launch further attacks against the server or other systems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize user-controlled input:**  Never directly trust user-provided URLs. Sanitize them using a robust library or custom validation logic to ensure they only point to allowed destinations.

2. **Whitelisting:** Instead of relying on generic validation, establish a whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses for redirects. This limits the potential attack surface.

3. **Use parameterized queries:** If redirecting based on user data, leverage parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent direct URL manipulation.
