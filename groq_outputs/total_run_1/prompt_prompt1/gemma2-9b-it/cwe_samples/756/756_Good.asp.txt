VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The `RemoteOnly` mode in the `<customErrors>` configuration can lead to a security vulnerability known as  **missing error pages**.

EXPLANATION: 

The `RemoteOnly` mode instructs ASP.NET to only display custom error messages to clients making requests **from remote locations**. This means that if a runtime error occurs within your application, it will not display any specific error message to users accessing the application locally (e.g., during development or testing).

**Security Implications:**

* **Debugging Challenges:** Developers cannot easily identify and debug issues during development.  
* **Information Disclosure:** Malicious actors could potentially exploit this behavior by triggering errors during development, potentially revealing sensitive information from the underlying exception message.  They might be able to discover details about the application's structure, server environment, or even internal logic.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Remove `RemoteOnly` entirely:** 

   It's generally advisable to remove the `RemoteOnly` attribute and display custom error messages both locally and remotely. This allows for better debugging and prevents potential information disclosure.  
* **Use a More Secured Approach:**  

   If you have specific requirements for handling errors differently across remote and local access, consider alternative techniques like:

     * **Error Logging:** Implement robust error logging that captures detailed information about exceptions regardless of the request origin.
     * **Custom Error Handling:**  Create custom error handling logic that differentiates error responses for different request sources.
