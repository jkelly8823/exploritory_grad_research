VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through unchecked stack trace disclosure.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a simple error handling mechanism within a servlet method (`doPost`).  

The issue lies in the `catch` block that handles the `ApplicationSpecificException`.  It logs the entire exception object using `ase.toString()`. This effectively prints the stack trace information associated with the exception. 

In a web application, a malicious actor could potentially craft input that triggers this exception. If the stack trace includes sensitive internal information (e.g., file paths, database connection strings), revealing them through the error log could expose vulnerabilities and potentially lead to a DoS attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. ** sanitize the exception message:** Instead of logging the entire exception object, explicitly log only the necessary information.  For example, log the exception type and a concise message: 
   ```java
   logger.error("Caught ApplicationSpecificException: {}", ase.getMessage());
   ```
2. **Use a dedicated error handling framework:** Frameworks often provide more robust mechanisms for handling exceptions, including the ability to control the level of detail logged. Consider using a framework like Spring to handle error logging more securely.



ORIGINAL CODE:

               Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());}}
               }}
