VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code snippet reveals plain-text LDAP username and password stored directly within the properties file. This is a severe security vulnerability as these credentials are easily accessible to anyone with access to the file. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Never store sensitive information like passwords in plain text within configuration files.**
2. **Use environment variables:** Store the credentials securely in environment variables and retrieve them from there at runtime.
3. **Implement a secure vault:** Utilize a dedicated secrets management system to store and manage sensitive data like passwords. This system should provide robust access controls and encryption.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
                     
                     # Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
                     ...webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword...
               ...   
               
               ```
