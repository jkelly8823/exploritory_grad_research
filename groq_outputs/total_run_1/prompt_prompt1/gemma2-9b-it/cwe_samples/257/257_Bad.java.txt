VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Sensitive Data Exposure - Storing password in plain text.

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet reveals a significant vulnerability: it appears to be directly comparing a user's provided password (`password`) with a stored password (`compressed_password`) without proper obfuscation or hashing. 

Storing passwords in plain text is extremely dangerous as it exposes them to attackers if the storage mechanism is compromised.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Hash the passwords:** 
   - Use a strong, cryptographically secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to hash both the provided password and the stored password. Hashing transforms passwords into irreversible one-way functions, making it significantly harder for attackers to recover the original password even if they gain access to the database.

2. **Salt the hashes:** 
   - Always append a unique, random "salt" value to each password before hashing it. A salt makes it harder for attackers to use pre-computed password tables (rainbow tables) to crack hashed passwords.
3. **Securely store passwords:** 
   - Store the hashed passwords and salt values separately from any other sensitive data.

 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (passwd.Equals(compress(password), compressed_password)) {return(0);}
                        //Diagnostic Mode
                        return(1);}
```
