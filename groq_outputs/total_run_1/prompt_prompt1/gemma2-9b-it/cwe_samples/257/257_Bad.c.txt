VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Password Comparison
EXPLANATION:
The code compares the compressed version of the user's input password (`compress(password)`) with a stored compressed password (`compressed_password`) using `strcmp`. This comparison function returns 0 if the strings are equal, but it's crucial to understand that `strcmp` is **not** designed for securely comparing passwords.  

**Here's why this is a vulnerability:** 

* **Direct Comparison:** Directly comparing strings can expose the comparison algorithm to timing attacks. An attacker might be able to infer the correctness of a password by analyzing the time it takes for the comparison to complete.
* **Compression Matters:** Depending on the compression algorithm used, the compressed representation of the password might not be sufficiently strong to prevent attacks like rainbow table attacks or dictionary attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Password Hashing:** Use a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to store passwords instead of compressing them. This makes it computationally infeasible to directly reverse the hash and reveal the original password. 
2. **Salting:** Add a unique random "salt" to each password before hashing. This makes precomputed rainbow tables useless against your system, as each password will have a different salt.
3. **Secure Comparison:** When verifying a password, hash the input password with the same algorithm and salt used for storage.  Compare the resulting hash values rather than the raw password strings.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
  if (strcmp(compress(password), compressed_password)) {
    printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
    return(0); 
  }
  printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
  return(1); 
} 
```
