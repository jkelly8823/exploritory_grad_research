VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None identified
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet demonstrates a portion of a state machine within a system implementing a SHA256 hash function. It initializes variables upon a reset signal and sets initial data values to zero. 

While the design might require further analysis for potential vulnerabilities in the SHA256 implementation itself, this snippet does not exhibit any immediately apparent coding flaws.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 

* **Further Analysis:** Analyze the complete SHA256 implementation to ensure its correctness and security against known vulnerabilities.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
...
// Implement SHA256 I/O memory map interface
// Write side
always @(posedge clk_i)
begin
  if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))
    begin
      startHash <= 0;
      newMessage <= 0;
      data[0] <= 0;
      data[1] <= 0;
      data[2] <= 0;
      ...
      data[14] <= 0;
      data[15] <= 0;

    end
...
```
