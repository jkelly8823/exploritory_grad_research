VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Out-of-Bounds Memory Access 
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to out-of-bounds memory access. In both of the `if` statements, you can see the lines:

`data[0] <= 0;
data[1] <= 0;
data[2] <= 0;
...
data[14] <= 0;
data[15] <= 0;`

This code attempts to write to memory locations indexed by `data[0]` through `data[15]`. However, without knowing the size and bounds of the `data` array declared earlier in the code, there's a risk of writing beyond allocated memory. If `data` is smaller than 16 elements, these accesses will result in an out-of-bounds memory write, which can lead to various security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Verify `data` Array Size:** Carefully review the declaration of the `data` array. Ensure that its size is at least 16 elements to accommodate all the indexed accesses. 

2. **Bounds Checking:** Implement explicit bounds checking before accessing or modifying elements in the `data` array. This can involve comparisons to determine if the index is within the valid range. For example:

   ```verilog
   if (index >= 0 && index < data_size)
       data[index] <= 0; 
   ```

   where `data_size` is the actual size of the `data` array.

3. **Consider Data Type:**  If `data` represents a large data structure, consider using more memory-efficient data types or data structures to minimize the risk of exceeding memory bounds.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
...



// Implement SHA256 I/O memory map interface
// Write side
always @(posedge clk_i)
	begin
		if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_3))
			begin
				startHash <= 0;
				newMessage <= 0;
				data[0] <= 0;
				data[1] <= 0;
				data[2] <= 0;
				...
				data[14] <= 0;
				data[15] <= 0;
			end
		else if(hashValid && ~hashValid_r)
			begin
				data[0] <= 0;
				data[1] <= 0;
				data[2] <= 0;
				...
				data[14] <= 0;
				data[15] <= 0;
			end			

 
...
```
