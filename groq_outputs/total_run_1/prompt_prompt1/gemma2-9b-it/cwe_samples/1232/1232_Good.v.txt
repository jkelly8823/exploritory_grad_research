VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Uninitialized Memory Access  
EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a `for` loop to assign values to memory locations `reglk_mem[j]`. However, there's no indication that the variable `j` is initialized before the loop. This can lead to unpredictable behavior as the loop might start with an undefined value for `j`, potentially causing out-of-bounds access or other memory-related issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Initialize `j`:**  Set `j` to a known initial value before the loop starts.  For example:

 ```verilog
 for (j = 0; j < 6; j = j + 1)
 ``` 
2. **Bounds Checking:**  Implement bounds checking within the loop to ensure `j` always stays within the valid range of the `reglk_mem` array.






ORIGINAL CODE:
            module reglk_wrapper #(
            ...
            
              always @(posedge clk_i)
              
                begin
                
                  if(~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock && ~rst_9))
                  
                    begin
                    
                      for (j=0; j < 6; j=j+1) begin
                      
                        reglk_mem[j] <= 'hffffffff;
                      
                      end
                    
                    end
                  
                  ...
