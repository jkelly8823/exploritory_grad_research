VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Database Credentials
EXPLANATION: The code directly exposes database credentials (username "db2admin" and password "password") within the connection string. This practice is extremely insecure as it allows anyone with access to the code to view the sensitive information. 
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Store credentials securely:** Never hardcode database credentials directly in your code. Instead, utilize an environment variable, a configuration file, or a dedicated secrets management system to store these credentials.

2. **Use parameterized queries:** Avoid using string concatenation to build SQL queries, especially when dealing with user-provided data.  Use parameterized queries with placeholders to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
