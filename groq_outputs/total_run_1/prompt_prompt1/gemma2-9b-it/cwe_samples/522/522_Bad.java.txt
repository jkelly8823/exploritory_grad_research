VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive data exposure. The application reads the password directly from a plaintext configuration file ("config.properties").

EXPLANATION: 
Storing passwords in plain text configuration files is a severe security vulnerability.  An attacker who gains access to the "config.properties" file can easily retrieve the password and use it to authenticate to the database. This can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use environment variables:**  Instead of hardcoding the password in a file, read it from an environment variable.

```java
String password = System.getenv("DATABASE_PASSWORD"); 
```

* **Encrypt the configuration file:**  Encrypt the "config.properties" file using a strong encryption algorithm.  This will protect the password even if the file is compromised. 
* **Use a secure secrets management solution:**  For production environments, consider using a dedicated secrets management tool to securely store and retrieve sensitive data like passwords.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = prop.getProperty("password");DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);...
