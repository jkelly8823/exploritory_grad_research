VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive information (password) is being stored in a String variable directly.  
EXPLANATION:  Storing passwords directly in your code, especially in plain text, is a major security risk. 
 If your code is compromised, attackers could easily steal the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a password hashing algorithm:** Instead of storing the password directly, hash it using a strong algorithm like bcrypt or scrypt. 

2. **Store securely:** Even hashed passwords should be stored securely. Avoid hardcoding them into your code. Consider using a dedicated secrets management system or environment variables.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  ...String password = regKey.GetValue(passKey).toString();NetworkCredential netCred = new NetworkCredential(username,password,domain);...
               
               ...
               
               
               
               
```
