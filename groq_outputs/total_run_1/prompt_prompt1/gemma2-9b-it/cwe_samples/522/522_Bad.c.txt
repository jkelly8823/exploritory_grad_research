VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for sensitive data leak through plaintext password compression.
EXPLANATION: 
The code compresses the provided password (`compress(password)`) before comparing it with a stored value (`compressed_password`). This suggests the stored password is also compressed, potentially leading to a sensitive data leak scenario.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Data Storage in Plaintext:** If the compression algorithm used is weak or the compressed passwords are stored in a non-secure manner, an attacker could reverse-engineer the compression and potentially gain access to the original, unencrypted passwords.
* **Missing Proper Password Handling:**  Good security practices dictate that passwords should never be stored in plaintext or easily reversible formats. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Hash Passwords:**  Instead of compressing the passwords, hash them using a strong cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or Argon2. This makes it computationally infeasible to recover the original password from the hash.
2.  **Salting:**  Always use a unique random salt with each password hash. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.
3. **Secure Storage:** Ensure that the hashed passwords are stored securely, ideally encrypted at rest, in a database with appropriate access controls.
4. **Review Compression Algorithm:** If compression is absolutely necessary for other system functions, ensure the algorithm is strong and the compressed data is protected adequately.



ORIGINAL CODE: 

```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (strcmp(compress(password), compressed_password)) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return(0);
    }
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
    return(1);
}
