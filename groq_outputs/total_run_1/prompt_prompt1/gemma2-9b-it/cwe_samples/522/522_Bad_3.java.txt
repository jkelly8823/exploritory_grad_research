VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Credentials 
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet reveals hardcoded username and password values for LDAP authentication within a  `ResourceBundle` file. This practice is highly insecure because it exposes sensitive data directly in the codebase, making it vulnerable to:

* **Code Review Exposure:** Anyone with access to the code can easily view these credentials.
* **Version Control Risks:** If the code is under version control, the credentials will be tracked and potentially exposed in commit history.
* **Data Breaches:** In case of a compromise, attackers gain direct access to the sensitive credentials.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like usernames and passwords in environment variables. Access these variables within your application instead of embedding them directly in the code.
* **Configuration Files:** Use dedicated configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) separated from source code to manage sensitive data. These files can be stored securely and loaded at runtime.
* **Secrets Management Systems:**  For enhanced security, consider using dedicated secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. These systems provide robust mechanisms for storing, rotating, and accessing sensitive data securely.
