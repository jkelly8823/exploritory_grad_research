VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Integer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The expression `1 << -5` shifts the binary representation of 1 five bits to the left. When shifting a signed integer to the left by a negative amount, it effectively performs an arithmetic right shift. However, with an `unsigned int`, this can potentially lead to an integer overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value representable by the data type.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
*   **Careful Consideration of Shift Amounts:** Ensure that the shift amount used in the calculation does not result in an overflow. Positive shift amounts increase the value, while negative shift amounts decrease it.
*   **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking before and after the bitwise shift to prevent potential overflows. Compare the result against the maximum value of `unsigned int` to ensure it stays within the valid range.
