Here's the analysis of the provided code snippet:

**VULNERABLE: YES**
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 2
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:** Concurrent Signal Handling

**EXPLANATION:**

The code registers the  `handler` function to be called for both `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals.  However,  the  `signal()` calls are made within the `main` function, which is a single-threaded context. When  multiple signals arrive concurrently,  there's a risk of a race condition where:

1. **Signal 1  Arrives:** The  first `signal()` call sets up `SIGUSR1` to trigger `handler`.
2. **Signal 2 Arrives:** Before the first signal is handled, the second `signal()` call sets `SIGUSR2` to also trigger `handler`.

  This overwrites the previous signal handler, potentially causing unintended behavior or loss of signal handling for `SIGUSR1`.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

* **Use `sigaction()`:** The `sigaction()` function provides more robust signal handling mechanisms. You can specify different handlers for different signals and control signal flags (like blocking signals) more precisely. 

* **Threading or Asynchronous Handling:** If your application requires handling signals concurrently, explore multi-threading or asynchronous techniques to ensure signals are processed reliably.

**ORIGINAL CODE:**
```c
void handler (int sigNum) {...} // Assuming this function does something
int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
    signal(SIGUSR1, handler);
    signal(SIGUSR2, handler);   
}
```
