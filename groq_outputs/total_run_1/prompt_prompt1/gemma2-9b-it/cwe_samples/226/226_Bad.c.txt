VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Memory Scrubbing

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability where a sensitive `cleartext_buffer` containing data retrieved from `get_secret()` might not be adequately sanitized. 

Even though `scrub_memory()` is called, its effectiveness is unclear from the provided context. It's crucial to ensure that `scrub_memory()` completely overwrites the original contents of `cleartext_buffer` to prevent information leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Verify `scrub_memory()`:**  Thoroughly analyze the implementation of `scrub_memory()`. It must guarantee complete overwriting of the sensitive data, leaving no possibility for remnants to be recovered. 
2. **Salt & Hashing:** Consider replacing the use of `cleartext_buffer` entirely with a secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256. This would prevent storage of the actual sensitive data, mitigating the risk of exposure.

3. **Bounds Checking:**  Always ensure that `realloc()` returns a valid pointer and that subsequent operations don't exceed the allocated memory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
cleartext_buffer = get_secret();...cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024);...scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024); 
```
