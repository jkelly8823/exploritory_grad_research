VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Integer Overflow

EXPLANATION:

The code block you provided demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability within the `case` statement. 

Specifically, the lines `p_c[3] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[3] : wdata[31:0]` , `p_c[2] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[2] : wdata[31:0]` , and the subsequent similar lines,  could result in an integer overflow if `wdata[31:0]` exceeds the maximum value that `p_c` can hold.  

If `p_c` is a 32-bit register and `wdata[31:0]` attempts to be written with a value larger than the maximum representable value for a 32-bit integer, an overflow will occur. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

1. **Input Validation:** Implement checks to ensure the value of  `wdata[31:0]`  does not exceed the maximum value that `p_c` can hold.  This could involve comparing `wdata[31:0]` against the maximum representable value for a 32-bit integer and taking appropriate actions (e.g., clamping the value, raising an error) if it exceeds the limit.

2. **Data Type Consideration:** If possible, consider using a larger data type for `p_c` to accommodate a wider range of values and reduce the likelihood of overflow. 

3. **Safe Arithmetic:** Explore using libraries or functions that provide safe arithmetic operations designed to prevent integer overflows.

   begin
     if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset

         start <= 0;
         p_c[0] <= 0;
         p_c[1] <= 0;
         p_c[2] <= 0;
         p_c[3] <= 0;
         ...
       end
