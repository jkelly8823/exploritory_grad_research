VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None identified
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any immediately obvious vulnerabilities.  It declares a static constant string `appPropertiesConfigFile`. 

However, without more context about how this class is used, there could be potential issues:

* **Hardcoded File Path:**  Using a hardcoded file path like "app/properties.config" can be problematic if the application needs to be deployed in different environments (different file systems, directory structures). This could lead to configuration errors.
* **Insufficient Input Validation:** If this file path is obtained from user input or external sources, it's crucial to validate it carefully to prevent attacks like path traversal.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Consider Environmental Variables:**  Instead of hardcoding the file path, use environment variables to specify the location of the configuration file. This makes the application more flexible and easier to deploy in different environments.
2. **Sanitize User Input:** If the file path is derived from user input, rigorously sanitize it to prevent vulnerabilities like path traversal.
