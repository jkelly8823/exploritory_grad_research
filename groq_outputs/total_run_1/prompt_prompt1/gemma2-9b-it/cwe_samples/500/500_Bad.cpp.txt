VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Static File Path Hardcoding
EXPLANATION:  The code directly references a file path ("app/properties.config") within the `appPropertiesConfigFile` static variable. Hardcoding file paths in this manner can lead to several security vulnerabilities:

*   **Path Traversal:**  An attacker could manipulate input to access unintended files or directories outside the intended application path.
*   **Insecure Configuration:**  Changing the file path could require recompiling the application, making it difficult to manage configuration changes dynamically.
*   **Lack of Flexibility:**  The application becomes tied to a specific file location, which may not be suitable for different deployment environments.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
    *   **Use Environment Variables:** Store the file path in an environment variable and access it within the code. This allows for dynamic configuration and reduces the risk of hardcoding sensitive information.
    *   **Configuration Files:**  Utilize a dedicated configuration file (e.g., JSON, YAML) to store the file path and other application settings. This promotes better organization and maintainability.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```c++
                  class SomeAppClass {
                        
                           public:static string appPropertiesConfigFile = "app/properties.config";
                           ...
                     }
               
               }
               
               
               
               ```
