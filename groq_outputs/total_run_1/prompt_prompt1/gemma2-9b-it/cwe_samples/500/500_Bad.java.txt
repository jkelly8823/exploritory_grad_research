VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded File Path
EXPLANATION: The code defines a static string variable `appPropertiesFile` that stores the path to a configuration file.  Hardcoding file paths directly into the code makes the application vulnerable to several issues:

* **Security:** An attacker could manipulate the file path to access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope.
* **Maintainability:**  If the file location needs to change, the codebase must be updated everywhere this path is used. This becomes difficult to manage as the application grows.
* **Portability:** Hardcoding paths often leads to problems when deploying the application to different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) that may have varying file structures. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Environment Variables:** Store the file path in an environment variable, allowing administrators to configure it without modifying the source code.
* **Configuration Files:** Utilize a dedicated configuration file (ideally separate from the source code) to store settings like file paths. Load these settings dynamically at runtime.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public class SomeAppClass {
                        
                           public static String appPropertiesFile = "app/Application.properties";...
                     }        
```
