VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:   Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: The code directly uses `param('username')` and `param('password')` without sanitizing the input. This means an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the username or password fields.  If a user submits a specially crafted username or password, the server could execute that code, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other harmful actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using `$username` and `$password`, sanitize the input to remove potentially harmful characters and tags. You can use a dedicated HTML sanitization library or write your own functions to escape special characters.
2. **Use Prepared Statements (If Applicable):** If you're using a database, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code.
3. **Validate User Input:**  Check that the `$username` and `$password` values meet your application's specific requirements (e.g., length, format) to avoid unexpected behavior or potential security issues.
 
ORIGINAL CODE:

```perl
                  my $username=param('username');
                  my $password=param('password');
                  
                  if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
                  {
                  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
                  {
                  print "Login Successful";
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
                  }
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - unknown username";
                  }
                  
               
               
               ```
