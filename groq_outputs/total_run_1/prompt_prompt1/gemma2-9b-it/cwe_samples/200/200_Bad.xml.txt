VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure permission declaration 
EXPLANATION: Using  `android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"` without justification or proper context can lead to privacy vulnerabilities. Accessing a user's fine location data should only be done when absolutely necessary and with explicit user consent.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. **Re-evaluate Necessity:**  Determine if accessing fine location data is truly required for your app's functionality. 
2. **Obtain User Consent:** If fine location access is essential, request permission at runtime and explain clearly to the user *why* your app needs this data. 
3. **Consider Alternatives:** Explore if you can achieve your app's goal using less sensitive location data, such as `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`.
4. **Minimize Data Collection:** Only collect the precise location data needed and for the shortest duration possible. 
5. **Secure Storage:** If storing location data, ensure it's encrypted and protected against unauthorized access.
