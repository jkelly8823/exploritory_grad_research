VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Direct Injection
EXPLANATION: The code snippet uses string interpolation (<%= ... %>) to directly insert the values of variables `ssn` and `ccn` into the HTML output.  This is highly vulnerable to injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the values of these variables to inject malicious JavaScript code, HTML, or other harmful content.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Input:** Before inserting any user-supplied data into HTML, sanitize it rigorously. This means escaping special characters that could be used for injection attacks.

2. **Parameterize Queries:** If these variables are coming from a database query, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This prevents malicious input from being interpreted as part of the SQL query.
3. **Use a Templating Engine:** Consider using a templating engine that provides secure ways to handle data interpolation, like Flask (Python), Jinja2 (Python), or Handlebars (JavaScript).

ORIGINAL CODE:
