VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The line `<%= acctNo %>` directly embeds the value of the `acctNo` variable into the HTML output without any sanitization. If an attacker controls the value of `acctNo`, they could inject malicious JavaScript code into the rendered HTML.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before displaying `acctNo` in the HTML, sanitize the value to remove or escape any potentially harmful characters. There are libraries available in most languages to help with this. 
2. **Use a Template Engine:** Employ a templating engine designed to escape potentially dangerous characters automatically. This will help prevent accidental XSS vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
%>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
```
