VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unhandled Exception
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a lack of robust exception handling. While it prints an error message, it does not provide mechanisms to recover from the exception or log it for debugging purposes.  This  can lead to application crashes and make it harder to diagnose and fix issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Specific Exception Handling:** Instead of catching a generic `Exception`, consider catching more specific exceptions like `PDOException` (for database connection errors) to provide more targeted error messages and handling.

2. **Logging:** Implement logging to record the exception message, stack trace, and relevant context (e.g., database configuration file) for debugging and monitoring.

3. **Recovery Mechanisms:** Explore strategies to recover from the exception. This might involve retrying the database operation with backoff logic, providing alternative fallback actions, or notifying administrators.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
try {
    openDbConnection();
}
//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';
    echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';
}
```
