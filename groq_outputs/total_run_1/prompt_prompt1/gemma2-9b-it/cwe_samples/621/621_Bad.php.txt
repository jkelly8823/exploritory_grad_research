VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly embeds user input into a SQL query without proper sanitization. The `buildQuery($user,$pass)` function is not shown, but it is likely constructing a query that includes the `$user` and `$pass` variables directly. An attacker could craft malicious input for these variables that modifies the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data, modify database contents, or even execute arbitrary commands on the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use parameterized queries:** Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL query, use parameterized queries. This separates the SQL code from the data, preventing malicious input from being interpreted as code.
2. **Sanitize user input:** Before using user input in any SQL query, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters and prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be done using functions like `mysql_real_escape_string()` (although it's recommended to switch to prepared statements as mentioned above), or by using more robust input validation libraries.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
    //Log user in, and set $isAdmin to true if user is an administrator

    function login($user,$pass){$query = buildQuery($user,$pass);mysql_query($query);if(getUserRole($user) == "Admin"){$isAdmin = true;}}
    $isAdmin = false;extract($_POST);login(mysql_real_escape_string($user),mysql_real_escape_string($pass));));
```
