VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Trust Decision Based on Hostname - Potential Domain Hijacking

EXPLANATION: 

The code directly trusts a user-supplied IP address by looking up its hostname.  An attacker could potentially control the hostname associated with a given IP address through a technique called domain hijacking. If an attacker manages to redirect the  "trustme.com" domain to a malicious server, the code would incorrectly identify it as trusted, leading to security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Avoid Relying on Hostnames:**  Do not base trust decisions solely on hostnames.  Hostnames can be spoofed.

* **Use Certificate-Based Authentication:** Instead of relying on DNS lookups, implement certificate-based authentication to verify the identity of the remote host. 

* **Whitelist Known Trusted Hosts:** Maintain a strict whitelist of known trusted hosts and only allow connections from those sources. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
IPAddress hostIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse(RemoteIpAddress);
IPHostEntry hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(hostIPAddress);
if (hostInfo.HostName.EndsWith("trustme.com")) {
    trusted = true;
}
```
