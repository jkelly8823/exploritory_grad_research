VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory Leak
EXPLANATION: 
The code allocates memory using `malloc()` but fails to properly release it using `free()`.

While `delete ptr` is used, it's incorrect because `malloc()` returns a raw pointer (`int*`) and should be deallocated using `free()`. 

This results in a memory leak as the allocated memory will not be returned to the system, potentially leading to program instability or crashes over time.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace `delete ptr;` with `free(ptr);` in the `foo()` function.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
                  class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));delete ptr;}
               
            ;}
               
            
               
            ```
