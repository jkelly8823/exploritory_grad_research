VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Leak
EXPLANATION: 
The code allocates memory for a `BarObj` using `new` but does not specify its explicit deallocation within the `foo` function's scope. If  `BarObj` has dynamically allocated memory within its own constructor, this will lead to a memory leak where the allocated memory is not returned to the system when the object is no longer needed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Ensure Proper Deallocation:**   
   - If `BarObj` holds dynamically allocated memory, override the destructor (`~BarObj()`) to deallocate it using `delete` or delete[] depending on the type of memory allocated. This ensures the memory is released when the object goes out of scope.

2. **Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):** 
   - Consider using smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) to manage the `BarObj` pointer. Smart pointers automatically handle memory deallocation, eliminating the risk of leaks.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
void foo(){
  BarObj *ptr = new BarObj();
   /* do some work with ptr here */ 
    
     ...
     free(ptr);
   }
```
