VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  
EXPLANATION: 
While the code snippet doesn't present an immediate, obvious vulnerability, it highlights a potential issue related to resource management. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Add Error Handling:**  Consider implementing error handling within the `new BarObj()` allocation. If memory allocation fails, the program might crash.  

- **Resource Leaks (Contingency):** The code looks fine, but it's crucial to remember that if the `do some work...` section throws an exception or encounters an error, it could potentially prevent the `delete ptr;` statement from executing. This would lead to a memory leak.  
Pay close attention to the code within `do some work...` to ensure proper exception handling and ensure that `ptr` is always deallocated when it's no longer needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj();
    /* do some work with ptr here */ 
    ...
    delete ptr;
}
```
