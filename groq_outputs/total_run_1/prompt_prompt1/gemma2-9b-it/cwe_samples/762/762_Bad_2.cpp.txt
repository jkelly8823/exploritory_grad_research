VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Memory Leak
EXPLANATION: 
The code allocates memory on the heap using `new` if the `heap` flag is true. However, there's no guarantee that the dynamically allocated memory will be deallocated correctly when `p` goes out of scope. This leads to a memory leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Ensure deallocation:** Add a check to ensure that the dynamically allocated memory is deallocated using `delete[] p` even if the `heap` flag is false.

Here's an improved version:


```c++
class A{
void foo(bool heap);
};
void A::foo(bool heap) {
int localArray[2] = {11,22};
int *p = localArray;
if (heap){
p = new int[2];
}
// Ensure deallocation regardless of heap flag
delete[] p; 
}
```



ORIGINAL CODE:


                  class A{void foo(bool);};void A::foo(bool heap) {int localArray[2] = {11,22};int *p = localArray;if (heap){p = new int[2];}delete[] p;}
