VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet uses `strcpy` to copy data from `srcBuf` into `destBuf`.  The issue lies in the lack of bounds checking. `idx` is calculated based on the position found by `strstr`, but it's not ensured that there's enough space remaining in `destBuf` after the "Replace Me" string. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `srcBuf` is longer than the available space in `destBuf`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a bounds-checked string copying function:** Instead of `strcpy`, use `strncpy`. This function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing overflows:

   ```c
   strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, sizeof(destBuf) - idx - 1); 
   destBuf[sizeof(destBuf) - idx - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination
   ```
2. **Calculate buffer size:** Before copying, ensure that `destBuf` has enough space to accommodate both the existing content ("Replace Me") and the new data from `srcBuf`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  int main() {
                     ...
                     char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
                     int idx = result - destBuf;
                     strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
                     ...}  
```
