VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses `file_get_contents($filename)`, which means an attacker could potentially manipulate the `$filename` parameter to include arbitrary files on the server. For example, if a user could control the `$filename` parameter, they might be able to include a file containing malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize Input:** Validate and sanitize `$filename` to ensure it only contains safe file paths. Never trust user input directly. 
* **Whitelisting:** Create a whitelist of allowed file paths and only allow access to files within that whitelist.
* **Use a Safer Alternative:** Consider using a library designed for secure file handling, which might offer better protection against LFI. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  function printFile($username,$filename){
                        
                           
                           //read file into string
                           $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
                     }
               
}
               
   ```
