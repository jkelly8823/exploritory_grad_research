VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `system()` function to execute a command built with user input (`$arg`) without proper sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to command injection attacks. An attacker could provide a filename as input that includes malicious commands, which would then be executed by the system function. For example, an attacker could enter `"; rm -rf /" ` as the filename, which would delete all files in the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Never directly use user input in commands executed by `system()`. Instead, use safe functions like `system()`'s safer alternatives or `backticks` to execute commands with escaped user input.
2. **Use a safer alternative to `system()`:** Consider using a library like `IPC::Run` or `IO::Pty` for running external commands in a more controlled environment. These libraries allow for better input validation and error handling.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
                  
		    my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
		    do_listing($arg);
		    
		    
		    sub do_listing {
		    
		      my($fname) = @_;
		      if (! validate_name($fname)) {
		      
			print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
			return;
		      
		      }
		      # build command
		      my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
		      system($cmd);
		    
		    }
		    
		    sub validate_name {
		    
		      my($name) = @_;
		      if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {
		      
			return(1);
		      
		      }
		      else {
		      
			return(0);
		      
		      }
		    
		    }
