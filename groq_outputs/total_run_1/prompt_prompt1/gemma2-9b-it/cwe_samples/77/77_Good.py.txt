VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability due to Unvalidated Regular Expression.

EXPLANATION:
The code utilizes a regular expression (`cweRegex`) to check if input strings (`arg1` and `arg2`) match the pattern "CWE-\d+".  While this seems like a reasonable way to validate potential CWE IDs, there's a potential for a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if malicious actors can craft input strings that:

* **Exhaust resources:**  A carefully crafted regular expression can force the `re.search()` function to perform an excessive number of operations, consuming significant CPU time and memory.
* **Trigger infinite loops:** Certain patterns could lead to the regular expression engine getting stuck in a loop, causing the application to hang.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize Inputs:** Before using `arg1` and `arg2` with the regular expression, thoroughly sanitize them to remove potentially harmful characters or patterns that could exploit the regex.

2. **Use a Regular Expression Library with DoS Mitigation:**  Consider using a more robust regular expression library that includes built-in DoS protection or rate limiting mechanisms.

3. **Limit Regex Complexity:** If possible, simplify the regular expression to reduce the chances of it being easily exploited.



ORIGINAL CODE:
				   cweRegex = re.compile("^CWE-\d+$")
				   match1 = cweRegex.search(arg1)
				   match2 = cweRegex.search(arg2)
				   if match1 is None or match2 is None:
				   
					 # throw exception, generate error, etc.
				   
				   prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(arg1, arg2)
				   ...
