VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The `system(cmd)` call is vulnerable to command injection because it directly executes the contents of the `cmd` buffer without sanitizing user input (`argv[1]`). An attacker could provide malicious input as the first argument (`argv[1]`), leading to arbitrary command execution on the system.

For example, if `argv[1]` is "rm -rf /", the command `system(cmd)` would execute `"/usr/bin/cat /rm -rf /"` which would delete all files and directories in the root directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Avoid using `system()` directly:**  Use safer alternatives like `subprocess.run()` in Python or `popen()` with careful input handling.

* **Sanitize user input:**

   * Never directly concatenate user input into commands that will be executed.
   * Validate input to ensure it matches the expected format.
   * Escape user-supplied strings appropriately before including them in commands.
   * Consider using a dedicated command-handling library that provides input validation and sanitization.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
  strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
  system(cmd);
}
