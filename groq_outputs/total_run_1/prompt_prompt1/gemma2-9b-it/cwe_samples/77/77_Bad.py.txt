VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper input sanitization 
EXPLANATION:

The code directly inserts user-supplied arguments (`arg1` and `arg2`) into an SQL query string without any sanitization. This opens the door to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft malicious input for `arg1` and `arg2` that alters the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to:

* Retrieve sensitive data from the database
* Modify or delete existing data
* Execute arbitrary commands on the database server

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Parameterize your queries:** Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL query, use parameterized queries. This allows the database driver to treat user input as data, not code, effectively preventing SQL injection.

   ```python
   prompt = "Explain the difference between %s and %s" % (arg1, arg2) 
   ```
2. **Escape user input:** If you must concatenate user input into strings, properly escape special characters that could be interpreted as SQL code. Use the appropriate escaping function for your database system.

3. **Validate user input:** Enforce input validation rules to ensure that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and constraints. This can help prevent unexpected or malicious input from reaching your database.



ORIGINAL CODE:

				   
				   prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(arg1, arg2)
				   result = invokeChatbot(prompt)
				   resultHTML = encodeForHTML(result)
				   print resultHTML
