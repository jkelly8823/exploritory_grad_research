VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Possible Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability 
EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` could be vulnerable to a ReDoS attack if the `$name` variable is controlled by an untrusted source. The expression allows for greedy matching of alphanumeric characters and hyphens, which could lead to an attacker providing a string that causes the regex engine to spend an excessive amount of time trying to match. This can result in a denial of service condition, as the application becomes unresponsive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Use a less greedy regular expression:**  Consider using a quantifier like `{1,10}` to limit the number of characters that can be matched.  For example:  `^\w[\w\-] {1,10}$`
- **Sanitize user input:** Validate and sanitize user input before using it in the regular expression. This can help prevent malicious input from causing ReDoS attacks.
- **Use a safer regex engine:** Some regex engines have built-in protections against ReDoS attacks.
