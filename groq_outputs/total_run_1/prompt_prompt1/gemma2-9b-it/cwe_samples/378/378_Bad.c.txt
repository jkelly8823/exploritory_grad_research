VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of `tmpfile()` without proper file closure. 
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet demonstrates a common vulnerability related to temporary file handling.  It utilizes `tmpfile()` to create a temporary file, but it fails to close the file explicitly before using `remove()` to delete it. 

Here's why this is a problem:

* **Resource Leaks:** If an error occurs after `tmpfile()` is called but before `fclose()` (which should be used to close the file), the temporary file may remain open, consuming system resources. This can lead to performance issues and potential denial-of-service scenarios, especially if many temporary files are created in a short period.

* **Unexpected File Behavior:** Depending on the operating system and the specific circumstances, the file might not be properly deleted if it's not closed first. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Close the File Explicitly:** Always close the temporary file after you're done with it using `fclose(stream)`.  

2. **Use  `tmpfile()` Sparingly:** Consider using alternative methods for temporary file creation, such as `mkstemp()` which provides more granular control and options.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  FILE *stream;if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {
                        
                           perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");return (-1);
                     }
                     // write data to tmp file
                     ...// remove tmp filermtmp();
