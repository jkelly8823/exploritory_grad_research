VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for HTML injection

EXPLANATION: 
The code attempts to sanitize user input by replacing certain characters. However, it does not comprehensively sanitize all potentially harmful characters. Specifically, the handling of less than symbols (`<`) is incomplete.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Use a dedicated library for HTML sanitization:** Instead of manually handling char replacement, leverage established libraries like OWASP ESAPI, which provide robust and secure sanitization techniques. These libraries are constantly updated to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Validate and escape all user input:** Ensure that the input is validated according to expected data types and formats. Then, properly escape it before using it in HTML output. This prevents malicious code injection even if the sanitizer misses something.
- **Consider input whitelisting:**  Instead of blacklisting potentially harmful characters, define a whitelist of allowed characters. This limits the impact of unexpected input.
- **Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded within your web application, further mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

                              if( '&' == user_supplied_string[i] ){dst_buf[dst_index++] = '&';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'a';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'm';dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'p';dst_buf[dst_index++] = ';';}else if ('<' == user_supplied_string[i] ){

                                 }else dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];
                           }return dst_buf;
                     }
