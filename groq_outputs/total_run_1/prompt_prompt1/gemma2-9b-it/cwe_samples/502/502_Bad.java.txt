VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Deserialization Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
The code demonstrates a classic deserialization vulnerability. It reads an object from a file ("object.obj") using an `ObjectInputStream`.  Without proper input validation or sanitization, this opens the door for malicious actors to:

* **Execute arbitrary code:** An attacker could craft a specially designed "object.obj" file that, when deserialized, contains malicious Java code. This code would then run within the context of the application. 
* **Bypass security mechanisms:**  Attackers might exploit deserialization to circumvent access controls or other security measures implemented in the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Avoid Deserialization from Untrusted Sources:**  Never deserialize objects from files or networks where you don't have complete control over the source.

2. **Validate and Sanitize Input:** If deserialization from an external source is unavoidable, implement strict validation and sanitization measures. This could involve:
    * **Whitelisting:** Only allow deserialization of objects from a predefined set of known, trusted classes.
    * **Input Filtering:** Remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code fragments from the serialized data before deserialization.

3. **Use Secure Serialization Alternatives:** Explore alternative serialization formats that are more resistant to attacks, such as Protocol Buffers or JSON.
