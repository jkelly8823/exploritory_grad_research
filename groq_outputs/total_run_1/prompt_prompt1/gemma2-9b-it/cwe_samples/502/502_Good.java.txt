VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to hardcoded exception message.
EXPLANATION:
The code throws a `java.io.IOException` with a specific message "Cannot be deserialized". While this might seem harmless, attackers could exploit this predictable error message. By repeatedly deserializing an object, they could potentially exhaust system resources or infer internal workings of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Use a more generic exception**: Instead of specifying the message, throw a `java.io.IOException` without a custom message. This prevents attackers from easily identifying the cause of the failure. 

2. **Log the exception**:  Log the exception details, including the class name and any relevant context, instead of relying solely on a hardcoded message. This provides more information for debugging and security analysis.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws java.io.IOException {throw new java.io.IOException("Cannot be deserialized"); }
               
 }
               
            ```
