VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:

The code snippet you provided demonstrates a potential SQL injection vulnerability.  The `login_user` function is likely performing database queries to authenticate the user.  The variables `$user` and `$pass` are obtained directly from a POST request, meaning they are user-supplied input. If these values are not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in the SQL query within `login_user`, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code. 

For example, an attacker could submit a username containing SQL code, such as:

```
admin'--
```

This could potentially allow the attacker to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Before using `$user` and `$pass` in the `login_user` function, implement proper sanitization techniques. This generally involves encoding or escaping special characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands.

2. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** The most robust way to prevent SQL injection is to use parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements.  Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL query string, you would use placeholders.  The database driver would then safely handle the substitution of the user input values.

3. **Validate Input:**  In addition to sanitization, validate user input to ensure it meets expected formats and lengths. This can help prevent unexpected or malicious input from being processed.


ORIGINAL CODE:




```php
// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
...
if ($authorized) {generatePage();} 
```
