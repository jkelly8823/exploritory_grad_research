VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
EXPLANATION: 

The code directly uses user input from the `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` variables without any sanitization or validation. Since this input is used in the `login_user` function, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into these fields. When a user submits this malicious input, it would be executed within the context of the website, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface the website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Before passing user input to any function, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters. Use appropriate functions like `htmlspecialchars()` for outputting data to the browser and `filter_var()` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` to clean up input data.

2. **Validate User Input:** Implement input validation to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and lengths. This helps prevent unexpected behavior or data injection attempts.

3. **Use Prepared Statements (for databases):** If you are using a database, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This separates the data from the SQL commands, making it harder for attackers to manipulate queries.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];
$pass = $_POST['pass'];
$authorized = false;
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {
  $authorized = true;
}
```
