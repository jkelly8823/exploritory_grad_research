## Code Analysis Results

**VULNERABLE:** YES
**VULNERABLE_LINES:** 1
**VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:**  SQL Injection vulnerability.
**EXPLANATION:**

The code snippet demonstrates a lack of input sanitization before using the `$user` and `$pass` variables in the `login_user` function. This opens the door for a classic **SQL Injection** attack.  An attacker could craft malicious input in the `$user` and `$pass` POST parameters, potentially manipulating the SQL query executed by `login_user`. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even complete control of the database.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Sanitize User Inputs:** Implement robust input validation techniques to ensure that `$user` and `$pass` contain only safe characters.  Functions like `htmlspecialchars()` for HTML contexts and parameterized queries (prepared statements) are crucial for preventing SQL injection. 
2. **Use Prepared Statements:**  Instead of directly embedding variables into the SQL query, utilize prepared statements. This separates the SQL structure from the user-supplied data, significantly mitigating SQL injection risks.
3. **Input Length Validation:**  Enforce limits on the length of `$user` and `$pass` to deter excessively long inputs that might be used for malicious purposes.



**ORIGINAL CODE:**

```php
// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
...
if ($authorized) {generatePage();} 
```
