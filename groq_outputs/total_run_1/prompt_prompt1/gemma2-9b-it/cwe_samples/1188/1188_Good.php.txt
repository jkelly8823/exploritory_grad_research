VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Injection Vulnerability (Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS))
EXPLANATION: 

The code directly uses user input from `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` without sanitization or validation. This makes it vulnerable to several attacks, including injection attacks and XSS.  An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `$user` or `$pass` variables, which could then be executed by the `login_user` function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using user input in any function, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters. For example, use a function like `htmlspecialchars()` to escape HTML characters in `$user` and `$pass`.

2. **Validate User Input:** Enforce rules on the type and format of user input. For example, ensure the `$user` input conforms to a username pattern and the `$pass` input meets a certain length requirement.

3. **Use Prepared Statements:**  If interacting with a database, utilize parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection. This separates the user input from the SQL query structure.

4. **Input Validation Function:** Create a function specifically for validating user input, which can be reused across your application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];
$pass = $_POST['pass'];
$authorized = false;

if (login_user($user,$pass)) {
  $authorized = true;
}
```
