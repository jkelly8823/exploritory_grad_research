VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Memory Allocation Error 
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory using `malloc`. However, it only checks if the result (`tmp`) is less than 0.  A successful `malloc` call should return a valid memory address (not 0), so this check doesn't accurately determine if the allocation was successful. In many implementations, `malloc` returns `NULL` if the allocation fails.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Check for `NULL`:**  Modify the check to ensure `tmp` is not `NULL`.  

```c
tmp = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);
if (tmp == NULL) {
    perror("Failure");
    // Handle the memory allocation error
}
```

2. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for memory allocation failures. Consider:
   - Logging the error.
   - Releasing any allocated resources.
   - Returning an error code to the caller.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  tmp = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);if (tmp < 0 ) {
                        perror("Failure");
                           //should have checked if the call returned 0
                           
                        
                     }
               
               ```
