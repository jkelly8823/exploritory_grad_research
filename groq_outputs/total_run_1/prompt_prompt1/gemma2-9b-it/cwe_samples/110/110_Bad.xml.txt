VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential
EXPLANATION:  While this code snippet doesn't directly demonstrate code execution, the presence of user-supplied data (`<arg0 key="start.date"`, `<arg0 key="end.date"`, `<arg0 key="range.scale"`) within the HTML fields (`<field>`) raises a significant XSS risk. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields, which could then be executed by a user's browser when they submit the form.
RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input sanitization mechanisms to filter out potentially harmful characters and code before they are incorporated into the HTML.

2. **Encode Output:** Carefully encode any user-supplied data that is displayed back to the user in the HTML. This ensures that special characters, including those used in JavaScript, are treated as data and not as executable code.
3. **Use a Template Engine:** Consider using a templating engine that separates data from presentation logic. This can help mitigate XSS vulnerabilities by providing a controlled way to insert user data into HTML.
ORIGINAL CODE: 
                  <form name="DateRangeForm"><field property="startDate" depends="date"><arg0 key="start.date"/></field><field property="endDate" depends="date"><arg0 key="end.date"/></field><field property="scale" depends="integer"><arg0 key="range.scale"/></field></form>
