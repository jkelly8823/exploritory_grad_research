VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Buffer Overflow

EXPLANATION:

The vulnerability lies in the potential for a buffer overflow. While the provided code snippet doesn't explicitly demonstrate a buffer overflow,  the way `test_string` is allocated and used raises concerns. 

Here's why:

* **Dynamic Allocation Not Shown:** The code doesn't show how `test_string` is allocated. If it's allocated with a fixed size and a longer string ("Hello World!") is assigned to it, it could lead to data overwriting adjacent memory. This is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Size-safe String Management:**

   - Use functions from the `<string.h>` library (like `strncpy`) that take a maximum length argument to prevent writing beyond the allocated buffer.
   -  Consider using `std::string` or equivalent string classes in modern C++ that handle dynamic allocation and bounds checking.

2. **Input Validation:**

   - If `test_string` is supposed to hold user-provided data, validate the input length before assigning it to the buffer to avoid unexpected sizes.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
				char *test_string;
				if (i != err_val)
				{
				test_string = "Hello World!";
				}
				else {
				test_string = "Done on the other side!";
				}
				printf("%s", test_string);
```
