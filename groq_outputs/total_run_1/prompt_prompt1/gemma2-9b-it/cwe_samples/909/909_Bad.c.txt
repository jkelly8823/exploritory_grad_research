VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code `strcat(str, "hello world");` performs string concatenation without checking if there is enough space in the `str` buffer. The `str` array is declared with a size of 20 characters, but "hello world" is 12 characters long. This leaves 8 characters of space remaining.  

The `strcat` function continues writing to the buffer until it encounters a null terminator, even if it exceeds the buffer's allocated size. This can lead to a buffer overflow where data is written beyond the intended memory location, potentially overwriting other variables or even corrupting the program's execution flow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Use a bounded string concatenation function like `strncpy` to limit the number of characters copied to the buffer. For example:

```c
strncpy(str, "hello world", sizeof(str) - 1); // Leave space for the null terminator
str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\0'; 
```
*  Sanitize user input to prevent malicious input from triggering buffer overflows. This involves carefully validating and limiting the length of user-supplied data before using it in string operations.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  char str[20];
strcat(str, "hello world");
printf("%s", str);
               
               );
               
               
               
               ```
