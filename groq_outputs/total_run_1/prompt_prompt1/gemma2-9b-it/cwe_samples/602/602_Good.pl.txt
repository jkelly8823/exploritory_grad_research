VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line 7, Line 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code does not properly sanitize user input before using it in network requests, potentially leading to a vulnerability like command injection or a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.  

EXPLANATION: 
* **Line 7**:  The user-provided username and password are directly used in the `writeSocket` command (`AUTH $username $password\n`). If a malicious user enters specially crafted input, it could lead to executing unintended commands on the server or hijacking the authenticated session. 
* **Line 9**: Similarly, the  `$address` variable, obtained without input sanitization, is directly used in the `writeSocket` command (`CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n`).  This could allow an attacker to manipulate the address update, possibly affecting the system's functionality or data integrity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques before using any user-provided data in network requests or commands. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:** Only accept expected characters and formats for usernames, passwords, and addresses.
    * **Encoding:** Properly encode user input to prevent it from being interpreted as code by the server. For example, use URL encoding for addressing and HTML escaping for displaying user-generated content.

2. **Use Prepared Statements (if applicable):**  If the server-side code uses a database, employ parameterized queries (or prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. These separate user data from command structure, mitigating the risk of malicious code injection.
3. **Limit User Privileges:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This principle of least privilege minimizes the damage an attacker could inflict if they compromise a user account. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
 $server = "server.example.com";
$username = AskForUserName();
$password = AskForPassword();
$address = AskForAddress();
$sock = OpenSocket($server, 1234);
writeSocket($sock, "AUTH $username $password\n");
$resp = readSocket($sock);
if ($resp eq "success") {
    
    
    # username/pass is valid, go ahead and update the info!
    writeSocket($sock, "CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n";
}else {print "ERROR: Invalid Authentication!\n";}
 
```
