VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for SQL injection vulnerability

EXPLANATION:

The code snippet you provided doesn't explicitly use SQL queries. However, there's a risk of SQL injection if the `accountOwnerName` or `accountOwnerSSN` variables are later used in constructing SQL statements without proper sanitization.  SQL injection occurs when malicious input is introduced into SQL queries, potentially allowing attackers to execute unauthorized commands on the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using `accountOwnerName` and `accountOwnerSSN` in any SQL queries, sanitize them rigorously to remove potentially harmful characters. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which effectively separate data from the SQL command structure, mitigating the risk of injection.
2. **Input Validation:**  Validate the format and content of `accountOwnerName` and `accountOwnerSSN` to ensure they meet your application's requirements.  For example, check if SSNs conform to the expected format.
3. **Secure Data Storage:** Store sensitive data like SSNs with appropriate encryption measures.

Remember: Preventing SQL injection is crucial for secure application development.
