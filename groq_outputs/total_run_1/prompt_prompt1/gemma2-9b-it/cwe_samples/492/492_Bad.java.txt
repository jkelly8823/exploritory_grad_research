VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None found
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet is incomplete and lacks context. It shows the declaration of a class `urlTool` extending `Applet` with a private nested class `urlHelper`.  Without further code, it's impossible to determine potential vulnerabilities. 

To effectively assess code for vulnerabilities, the code needs to include:

* Function definitions
* Usage of external libraries or APIs
* Data handling and input validation
* Network communication logic
* Security configurations 

Without these elements, it's not possible to identify any specific vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Please provide a more complete code snippet for analysis. 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public final class urlTool extends Applet {
  private final class urlHelper {
    // Code for urlHelper class goes here
  }
}
```
