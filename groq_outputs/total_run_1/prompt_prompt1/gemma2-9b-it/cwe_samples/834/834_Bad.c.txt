VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Recursion
EXPLANATION: 
The code demonstrates infinite recursion. The function `do_something_recursive` calls itself without modifying the input parameter `flg`. Since `flg` is always set to a truthy value (1), the `if` condition is always met, leading to an endless loop of recursive calls. This will eventually exhaust the call stack, resulting in a stack overflow error. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  **Modify `flg`:** Introduce a mechanism within the recursive calls to modify the value of `flg`. This could involve decrementing it or changing it based on a condition. Ultimately, the goal is to create a path for the recursion to terminate.

2. **Base Case:**  Implement a base case within the `do_something_recursive` function. This base case should define a condition where the function stops calling itself, preventing infinite recursion. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
	       void do_something_recursive (int flg)
	       {
	       
		 ... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
		 if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes

	       
	       }
	       int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
	       do_something_recursive (flag);
             
             ```
