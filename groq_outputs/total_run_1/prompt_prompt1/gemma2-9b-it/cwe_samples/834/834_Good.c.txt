VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Recursion
EXPLANATION: The code contains a potential for infinite recursion. The recursive call `do_something_recursive (flg);` is made within a conditional statement that only checks the value of `flg`. If `flg` is not modified within the recursive function, the function will keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   **Ensure `flg` is modified within the recursive function:** The condition under which the recursion stops  needs to be met reliably. This likely involves decrementing `flg` or changing its state in a way that will eventually lead to the `if` condition being false.

*   **Add a base case:**  Include a condition in your `do_something_recursive` function to prevent infinite recursion. This base case should stop the recursion when a specific condition is met (e.g., `flg` reaches 0).


ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
  
  ... // Do some real work here
  // Modify value of flg on done condition
  if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // returns when flg changes to 0
  
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag); 
```
