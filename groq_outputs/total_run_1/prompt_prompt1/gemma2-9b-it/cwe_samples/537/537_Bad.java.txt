VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-25
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code lacks proper input validation and sanitation before constructing the file path.
EXPLANATION:
The `setInputFile` method takes a `String inputFile` as parameter but doesn't perform any validation or sanitization on this input. This makes the application vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. An attacker could provide a malicious input, like "../secretFile.txt", which could allow them to access files outside the intended directory (`c:\\somedirectory\\`). 

Moreover, the `readFile` variable is not initialized within the `setInputFile` method.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize the input:**
Validate and sanitize the `inputFile` parameter to prevent directory traversal attacks. You can do this using well-established libraries like Apache Commons Lang or by implementing your own validation logic.

2. **Use a secure way to construct file paths:** Instead of directly concatenating the input with `DEFAULT_FILE_PATH`, consider using a safer approach like:
 * Java's `File.separator` char to correctly join directory and filename components. 
 * Libraries like Apache Commons FileUtils, which offer secure methods for filename manipulation.

3. **Initialize `readFile`:** Ensure that `readFile` is correctly initialized within `setInputFile` to a valid `File` object based on the sanitized input.
 
 
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  public class InputFileRead {
                     
                        private File readFile = null;private FileReader reader = null;private String inputFilePath = null;private final String DEFAULT_FILE_PATH = "c:\\somedirectory\\";
                           public InputFileRead() {inputFilePath = DEFAULT_FILE_PATH;}
                           public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
                              
                                 
                                 /* Assume appropriate validation / encoding is used and privileges / permissions are preserved */
                                 
                              
                           }
                           public void readInputFile() {
                              try {reader = new FileReader(readFile);...} catch (RuntimeException rex) {System.err.println("Error: Cannot open input file in the directory " + inputFilePath);System.err.println("Input file has not been set, call setInputFile method before calling readInputFile");
                                 
                                 } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}
                              
                           }
                     }
               
               }
