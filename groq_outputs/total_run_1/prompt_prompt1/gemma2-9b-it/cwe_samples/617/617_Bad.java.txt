VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for null pointer exception
EXPLANATION:
While the code includes an assertion (`assert email != null;`), relying solely on assertions for error handling is not a robust solution in production environments. Assertions are primarily intended for debugging and may not always be executed during runtime depending on the environment configuration. If the `request.getParameter("email_address")` method returns `null`, the assertion will fail, potentially causing the application to crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Check for null values explicitly using an if statement before using the `email` variable:

```java
String email = request.getParameter("email_address");
if (email != null) {
  // Process the email
} else {
  // Handle the case where email is null
  // For example, log an error or display an appropriate message to the user
}
```




ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String email = request.getParameter("email_address");assert email != null;
