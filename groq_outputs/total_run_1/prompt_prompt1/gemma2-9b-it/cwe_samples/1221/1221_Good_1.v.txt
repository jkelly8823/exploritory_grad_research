VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  
EXPLANATION: The provided code snippet does not exhibit any immediately apparent vulnerabilities. 

It declares two parameters: 

- `MEM_SIZE` with a value of 100.
- `JTAG_OFFSET` with a value of 100.

These appear to be standard variable declarations.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
While not inherently vulnerable, it's good practice to consider the context of these parameters:
- **Input Validation:**  If `MEM_SIZE` is intended to be set dynamically, ensure it's validated to prevent potential buffer overflows or memory allocation issues.
- **Security:**  If `JTAG_OFFSET` relates to a hardware interface, be mindful of security implications.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
					parameter  MEM_SIZE = 100;
					localparam JTAG_OFFSET = 100;
