VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet directly inserts user-supplied data (`e.getText()`) into the HTML output without any sanitization. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the guestbook entries. When other users view these entries, the injected script could execute in their browsers, potentially stealing their data, redirecting them to malicious websites, or taking other harmful actions. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 - Sanitize all user-supplied input before displaying it in the HTML. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'`. 
 - Consider using an established library or framework that provides built-in functions for input sanitization. 
 - Use a templating engine that supports secure escaping of variables.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  
                  <% for (Iterator i = guestbook.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {Entry e = (Entry) i.next(); %><p>Entry #<%= e.getId() %></p><p><%= e.getText() %></p><%} %>
