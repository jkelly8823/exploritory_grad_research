VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Buffer Overflow
EXPLANATION: 
The code dynamically allocates memory using `malloc()` based on the value of `num_imgs`. However, `get_num_imgs()` is not shown and could potentially return a very large value, leading to a buffer overflow if `num_imgs` exceeds the available memory.  A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Input Validation:**  Before calling `malloc()`, validate the value returned by `get_num_imgs()`. Ensure it's within a reasonable range and doesn't exceed a safe maximum size. 
2. **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking when accessing or modifying the data in `table_ptr`. This can help prevent overflows even if `num_imgs` is unexpected.
3. **Safe Memory Allocation:** Consider using safer memory allocation functions like `calloc()` or `realloc()` which can help prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
...
```
