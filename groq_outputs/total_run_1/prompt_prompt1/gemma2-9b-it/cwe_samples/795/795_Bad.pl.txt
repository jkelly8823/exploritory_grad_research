VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$Username`) with a file path without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input and potentially access files outside the intended directory. For example, an attacker could submit `..%2f..%2fetc/%2fpasswd`, which would result in the code attempting to read `/*etc/passwd`, a sensitive system file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Sanitize user input:** 
Use a whitelist approach to only allow valid characters or patterns in the username. 
* **Escape special characters:** Escape any potentially dangerous characters in the username before incorporating them into the file path.
* **Use a secure templating engine:** Consider using a templating engine like Jinja2, which provides safer ways to handle dynamic data within strings.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/^\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename); 
```
