VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Directory Traversal
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet performs a directory traversal vulnerability check. It uses `GetUntrustedInput()` which likely fetches user-supplied data without proper sanitization. This data gets incorporated into the `$filename` variable by concatenating with a predetermined path `/home/user/`. 

The line `if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {$Username = substr($Username, 3);}` attempts to mitigate the vulnerability by removing ".." from the beginning of the `$Username` if it's present. However, this is not a foolproof solution, as attackers could employ other methods to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

RECOMMENDATION:
1. **Sanitize Input:** 
    - Never directly trust user input. Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques before using it within file paths or any privileged operations.
    - Use regular expressions or dedicated libraries to enforce allowed characters and patterns in user input.
2. **Whitelist Allowed Paths:**
    -  Instead of allowing arbitrary paths, define a whitelist of allowed directories or file names that the application is permitted to access. 
3. **Absolute Path:**
    -  Always use absolute file paths instead of relative ones to prevent potential manipulation.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```perl
 my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {$Username = substr($Username, 3);}
 my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
 ReadAndSendFile($filename);); 
 ```
