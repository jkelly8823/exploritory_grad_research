VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Improper Output Encoding

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  The line  `<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) { %>User account number: <%= acctNo %><% } %>` directly embeds the value of the `acctNo` variable into the HTML output without any sanitization.

If `acctNo` contains malicious JavaScript code, it will be executed in the user's browser when the page is rendered.  This can lead to various attacks, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or hijacking user sessions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Escape Output:**
   Always escape user-supplied data before displaying it in HTML.  Specifically, use the `htmlspecialchars()` function or a similar mechanism to encode special characters in `acctNo` before outputting it.

   Here's an example of how to fix the code:

   ```html
   <% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) { %>
   User account number: <%= htmlspecialchars(acctNo) %> 
   <% } %>
   ```



2. **Contextual Encoding:** Consider the context in which `acctNo` is used. If it's part of an attribute like `href` or `src`, use URL encoding (`urlencode()`) instead of HTML encoding.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
%>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
```
