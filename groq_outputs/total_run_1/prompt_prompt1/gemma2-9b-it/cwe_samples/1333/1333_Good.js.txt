VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `/^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i`  could be vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. The use of `(?=(\w+))\2\s?` creates a backreference (`\2`) which can potentially lead to an exponential time complexity when matched against certain malicious inputs. 

Backreferences can get caught in a loop if the pattern they refer to can be repeated within the input string. This can cause the regular expression engine to iterate over the input many times, leading to a denial of service condition. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid using backreferences in complex patterns. If possible, rewrite the pattern using more straightforward constructs to improve efficiency.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                        var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
                        var good_pattern  = /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
                        var result = test_string.search(good_pattern);
                    
                     );
