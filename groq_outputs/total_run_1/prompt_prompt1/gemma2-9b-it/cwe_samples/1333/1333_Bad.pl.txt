VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `/^(\w+\s?)*$/i` may be susceptible to a ReDoS attack.  The pattern repeatedly matches one or more word characters followed by an optional space. If a malicious input with many repeated characters (especially word characters) is provided to  `$bdrslt =~ /^(\w+\s?)*$/i`, it could result in the regex engine spending an excessively long time trying to match the pattern, leading to a denial of service.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Use a more robust and specific regular expression:** Tailor the regex to explicitly target the exact pattern you intend to match, minimizing the chance of unintended matches.
* **Escape special characters:** If the input string could potentially contain metacharacters (characters with special meaning in regex), escape them appropriately.
* **Consider using a compiled regular expression:** Compiling a regex can improve performance, making it less susceptible to ReDoS attacks. However, it is important to ensure the compiled regex is well-designed and avoids potential vulnerabilities.
* **Implement input validation:** Always validate user input to prevent it from being maliciously crafted. This includes checking the length and format of input strings.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```perl
                        my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
                        my $bdrslt = $test_string;
                        $bdrslt =~ /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
;
                    
```
