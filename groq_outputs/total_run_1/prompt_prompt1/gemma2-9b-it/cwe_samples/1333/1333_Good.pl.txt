VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) 

EXPLANATION:

The provided code snippet uses a regular expression `/^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i`  to potentially process the string `$test_string`. The regular expression contains a backreference `\2` which refers to the second captured group. 

If a maliciously crafted input string contains repeating sequences of the characters captured by the first group (`\1` is a reference to the first captured group , the backreference `\2` will lead to an exponential increase in the number of potential matches. This can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive time and resources, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Validate and Sanitize Input:** Before processing any user input with a regular expression, always validate and sanitize it to prevent the injection of malicious patterns. 
* **Use Regexp-Safe Libraries:** Consider using libraries designed for secure regular expression processing. These libraries often offer protections against ReDoS attacks.
* **Avoid Unbounded Backreferences:** Where possible, try to re-write the regular expression to avoid using unbounded backreferences. If you must use backreferences, limit their potential for unbounded expansion.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
       my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
        my $gdrslt = $test_string;
         $gdrslt =~ /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;                   

```
