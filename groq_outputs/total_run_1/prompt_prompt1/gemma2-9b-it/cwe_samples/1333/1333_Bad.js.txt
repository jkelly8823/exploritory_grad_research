VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
EXPLANATION:
The provided code uses a regular expression (`/^(\w+\s?)*$/i`) that could lead to a ReDoS vulnerability. The regex `\w+\s?` matches one or more word characters followed by an optional whitespace. This pattern, if crafted maliciously, could result in an exponential time complexity when matching against a long input string.   An attacker could construct a string with a large number of repeated, closely matching word characters and spaces, causing the `search()` method to take an extremely long time to execute.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use a more robust and secure regex pattern:**  The current pattern is overly permissive. Replace it with a more specific pattern that limits the possibility of ReDoS. 

2. **Sanitize user input:** Before using user input with a regex, sanitize it to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.

3. **Avoid using regex for complex validation:** For complex validation tasks, consider using a dedicated language or library designed to handle pattern matching securely.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                        var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
                        var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
                        var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
