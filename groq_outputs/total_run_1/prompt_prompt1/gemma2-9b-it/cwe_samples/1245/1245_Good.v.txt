VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Case statement handling of user input
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  The code snippet demonstrates a potential vulnerability related to integer overflow or underflow. 

EXPLANATION: When a user inputs a value that doesn't fall within the expected range represented by the case values (3'h0 through 3'h5), the code attempts to access indeterminate memory locations. This could lead to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or even security exploits.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

1. **Input Validation:** Before processing the `user_input`, implement robust validation to ensure it falls within the acceptable range (0-5).

2. **Bounds Checking:** Introduce checks within the case statement to handle cases where `user_input` exceeds the expected range. This could involve mapping invalid inputs to a default case or raising an error. 

3. **Data Type Considerations:**  

    * **Narrow Data Type:** While the code snippet uses 3'h... for case values, it's worth noting that these represent 3-bit integers. If your user inputs are broader, you may need a wider data type.


Original CODE:

```
					  case (user_input)
					  3'h0:
					  3'h1:
					  3'h2:
					  3'h3: state = 2'h3;
					  3'h4: state = 2'h2;
					  3'h5: state = 2'h1;
					  default: state = 2'h0;
					
					  endcase
					
            	
					
            						
            	
```
