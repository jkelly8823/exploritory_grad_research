VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential for Resource Leaks
EXPLANATION: 
The `finalize()` method is a dangerous construct in Java. It is intended for performing cleanup tasks when an object is about to be garbage collected, but it is not guaranteed to be called, and its execution can be unpredictable. Calling `discardNative()` from within `finalize()` can lead to resource leaks if the cleanup action fails or if the garbage collector doesn't execute finalize() for some reason.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

* **Use `try-with-resources` for managing native resources:**  A much more robust and reliable way to manage native resources is to use the `try-with-resources` statement. This ensures that the resource is properly closed, even if exceptions occur.

```java
try (NativeResource resource = new NativeResource()) {
  // Use the resource here
} catch (Exception e) {
  // Handle any exceptions 
}
```

* **Prefer `close()` methods:** If possible, provide a well-defined `close()` method for your objects that explicitly releases native resources. This gives you more control over the cleanup process.
* **Avoid relying on `finalize()`:** Minimize or eliminate the use of `finalize()` altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void finalize() {discardNative();}
```
