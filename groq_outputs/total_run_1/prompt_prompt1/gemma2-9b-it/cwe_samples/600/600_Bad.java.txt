VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential Security Vulnerability (Invalid Input Sanitization)

EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses `req.getRemoteAddr()` to retrieve the client's IP address, which is then passed to `InetAddress.getByName()`. This function performs a DNS lookup based on the provided IP address.  The issue arises if the user input (the IP address) is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially provide a maliciously crafted IP address, leading to:

* **DNS Rebinding Attacks:** The attacker could attempt to trick the application into resolving a local hostname instead of the intended IP address, potentially allowing them to access internal systems or resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Before using `req.getRemoteAddr()`, sanitize the input to ensure it only contains valid IP address format. Utilize regular expressions or trusted libraries to validate the input.

2. **Avoid Direct DNS Lookups:** If possible, avoid performing direct DNS lookups using `InetAddress.getByName()`. Consider using techniques that mitigate the risk of DNS rebinding attacks, such as using a whitelist of trusted IP addresses or a more secure approach for obtaining hostname information.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
  String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
  InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
  ...
  out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}  
```
