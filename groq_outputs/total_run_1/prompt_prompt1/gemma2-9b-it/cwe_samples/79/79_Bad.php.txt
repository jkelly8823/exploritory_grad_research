VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly injects user-supplied data from the `$_GET['username']` parameter into an HTML element without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which could be executed in the browser of any user visiting the page.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Sanitize the `$username` variable using a proper escaping function like: `htmlspecialchars()`

```php
$username = htmlspecialchars($_GET['username']);
echo '<div class="header"> Welcome, ' . $username . '</div>';
```

This will convert special characters to their HTML entities, preventing them from being interpreted as code.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$username = $_GET['username'];echo '<div class="header"> Welcome, ' . $username . '</div>'; 
```
