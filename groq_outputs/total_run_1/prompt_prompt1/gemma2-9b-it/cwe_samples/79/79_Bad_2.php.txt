VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The code directly embeds user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This leaves the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the `$query` variable to execute malicious SQL commands. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements:** This is the recommended approach to prevent SQL injection. Instead of directly inserting values into the query string, use placeholders and pass the values separately. 

   Here's an example using prepared statements with PDO:

   ```php
   $dbh = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_database", "username", "password");
   $stmt = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE loggedIn = :loggedIn');
   $stmt->bindParam(':loggedIn', true, PDO::PARAM_BOOL);
   $stmt->execute();
   ```

2. **Escape user input:** If you cannot use parameterized queries, at least escape user input before including it in the SQL query.  

   **Important Note:** Escaping user input is not as secure as parameterized queries and should only be used as a last resort.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
                  $query = 'Select * From users Where loggedIn=true';$results = mysql_query($query);
                     if (!$results) {exit;}
                     
                     //Print list of users to page
                     echo '<div id="userlist">Currently Active Users:';while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($results)) {echo '<div class="userNames">'.$row['fullname'].'</div>';}echo '</div>';
               
               >';
               
               
               
               
```
