VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. On line 1, the `EmployeeID.Text = Login.Text;` statement directly assigns the value of the `Login` textbox to the `EmployeeID` label without any sanitization or encoding. If a malicious user enters script code into the `Login` textbox, it could be directly executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:**  Before displaying user-provided data, always sanitize and encode it to prevent the execution of arbitrary scripts. In this case, you should use server-side encoding methods to ensure that any HTML characters or scripts entered into the `Login` textbox are properly escaped before being displayed in the `EmployeeID` label.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries:** If you are using database queries, avoid directly inserting user input into SQL statements.  Instead, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<%protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox Login;protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label EmployeeID; ...EmployeeID.Text = Login.Text;%>
<p><asp:label id="EmployeeID" runat="server" /></p>
```
