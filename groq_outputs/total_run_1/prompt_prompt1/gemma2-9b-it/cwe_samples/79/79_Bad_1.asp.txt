VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION:
The code concatenates user input (`eid`) directly into an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or server takeover.  

For example, an attacker could modify the `eid` value to something like `1'; DROP TABLE emp; --` which would execute the `DROP TABLE emp` command, deleting the entire employee table.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Use parameterized queries:** Instead of directly concatenating user input into the query string, use parameterized queries. Parameters are treated as data values rather than executable code, preventing injection attacks.
- **Escape user input:**  Even if you're not using parameterized queries, carefully escape any user input that is incorporated into SQL queries. This involves encoding special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL code.

ORIGINAL CODE: 
```aspx
<%protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label EmployeeName;
...string query = "select * from emp where id=" + eid;
sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);
sda.Fill(dt);
string name = dt.Rows[0]["Name"];
...EmployeeName.Text = name;%><p><asp:label id="EmployeeName" runat="server" /></p>
>

```
