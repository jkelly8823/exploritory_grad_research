VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly embeds the `eid` variable into the SQL query without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input and potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands. For example, if `eid` is controlled by user input, an attacker could enter  `' OR 1=1 --`  which would bypass any authentication or authorization checks and potentially grant access to all data in the `emp` table.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
*   Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This involves separating the SQL code from the data values and passing the data as parameters.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
                  <%Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);if (rs != null) {rs.next();String name = rs.getString("name");}%>
                     Employee Name: <%= name %>               
``` 


Let me know if you'd like to see how parameterized queries would look in this scenario!
