VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
EXPLANATION: 
The code directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_COOKIE["myname"]` variable without any sanitization or escaping. This means that an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the `$name` variable through a specially crafted cookie. When the `$announceStr` is built and saved to a file, this malicious code could be executed, leading to various attacks like stealing user sessions, redirecting users to malicious websites, or even defacement of the website.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Sanitize user input:** Before using the `$_COOKIE["myname"]` value, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or tags that could be used for XSS attacks. Use a function like `htmlspecialchars()` to escape HTML characters.

* **Validate input:** Implement input validation to ensure that the `myname` cookie conforms to expected formats and values. This can help prevent unexpected or malicious inputs from being processed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
                  $name = $_COOKIE["myname"];$announceStr = "$name just logged in.";
                     
                     //save HTML-formatted message to file; implementation details are irrelevant for this example.
                     
				saveMessage($announceStr);
               
```
