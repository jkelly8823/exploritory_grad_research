VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded credentials 
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet stores LDAP username and password directly as string values. This is extremely insecure as it exposes the credentials directly in the code, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the source code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

* **Never hardcode sensitive information like passwords directly into your code.**
* **Use environment variables:** Store credentials in environment variables and retrieve them at runtime. This keeps the sensitive data outside the codebase.
* **Use a secure configuration management tool:**  Utilize tools like Hashicorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage and securely store your credentials.
* **Implement proper access control:** Ensure only authorized personnel have access to the code and the environment variables where credentials are stored.
ORIGINAL CODE: 
webapp.ldap.username=secretUsername
webapp.ldap.password=secretPassword
