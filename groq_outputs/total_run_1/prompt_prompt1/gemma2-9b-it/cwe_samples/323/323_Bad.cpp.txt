VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Hardcoded Password and Weak Nonce Usage
EXPLANATION: The code uses a hardcoded password ("secretPassword") which is a major security vulnerability. Hardcoding credentials makes them easily accessible to anyone who can view the code. Additionally, the nonce  ("bad nonce") is easily guessable,  allowing for potential replay attacks. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1.  **Never hardcode passwords.** Instead, store passwords securely using techniques like:
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt passwords before storing them.
    *   **Hashing:** Use strong cryptographic hash functions (like bcrypt) to generate a unique hash of the password. 
2. **Generate cryptographically strong random nonces.**  Use a secure random number generator to create nonces, and ensure they are unique for each request.  
3. **Implement proper input validation and sanitization** to prevent malicious input from affecting the code's execution.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String command = new String("some command to execute");MessageDigest nonce = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");nonce.update(String.valueOf("bad nonce"));byte[] nonce = nonce.digest();MessageDigest password = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");password.update(nonce + "secretPassword");byte[] digest = password.digest();sendCommand(digest, command)
