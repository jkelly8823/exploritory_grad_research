VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of a hardcoded nonce value ("bad")

EXPLANATION: 
The code uses a hardcoded nonce value ("bad") for encryption. This is a severe vulnerability because  a determined attacker could potentially predict or guess the nonce value, allowing them to decrypt the sensitive password data.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* **Generate a truly random nonce:**  Instead of hardcoding "bad", use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to create a new, unique nonce for each password encryption.
* **Store nonces securely:** If you need to associate nonces with requests or transmissions later, ensure they are stored securely and not in a way that an attacker could easily access.
* **Consider using a dedicated nonce storage mechanism:**  For increased security, explore using a dedicated nonce storage mechanism, such as a database or key management system, with proper access controls.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
                  void encryptAndSendPassword(char *password){char *nonce = "bad";...char *data = (unsigned char*)malloc(20);int para_size = strlen(nonce) + strlen(password);char *paragraph = (char*)malloc(para_size);SHA1((const unsigned char*)paragraph,parsize,(unsigned char*)data);sendEncryptedData(data)}
               
)}
               
               
```
