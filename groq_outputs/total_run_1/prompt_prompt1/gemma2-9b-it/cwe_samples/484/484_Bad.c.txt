VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Fallthrough Vulnerability in Switch Statement
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet demonstrates a potential fallthrough vulnerability in the `switch` statement.  

In C, `switch` statements inherently fall through if no `break` statement is encountered at the end of a case block. This means that code execution will continue into the next `case` block without interruption.

In this example, every `case` label is directly followed by another `case` label without any `break` statements. This leads to an unexpected behavior where all the months will be printed, joining together into a single output string because the code will fall through each case.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability,  it is crucial to insert `break` statements after each `case` label. This will ensure that execution terminates after each case is evaluated, preventing fallthrough.

Corrected Code:

```c
void printMessage(int month){
    switch (month) {
        case 1:
            printf("January");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("February");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("March");
            break;
        case 4:
            printf("April");
            break;
        case 5:
            printf("May");
            break;
        case 6:
            printf("June");
            break;
        case 7:
            printf("July");
            break;
        case 8:
            printf("August");
            break;
        case 9:
            printf("September");
            break;
        case 10:
            printf("October");
            break;
        case 11:
            printf("November");
            break;
        case 12:
            printf("December");
            break;
    }
    printf(" is a great month");
}
```
