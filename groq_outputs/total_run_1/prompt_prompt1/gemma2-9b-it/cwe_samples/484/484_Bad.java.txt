VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Potential for `fallthrough` vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a switch statement with no `break;` statements after each case label.  

This means that if a case is matched, the code will "fall through" to the next case, potentially executing unintended code. For example, if `month` is 1, the code will print "January" and then also execute the code for cases 2, 3, 4...and so on. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

*   Add `break;` statements after each case label within the switch statement to prevent fallthrough. This ensures that execution exits the `switch` block after a case is matched.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public void printMessage(int month){
    switch (month) {
        case 1: print("January");        
        case 2: print("February");
        case 3: print("March");
        case 4: print("April");
        case 5: print("May");
        case 6: print("June");
        case 7: print("July");
        case 8: print("August");
        case 9: print("September");
        case 10: print("October");
        case 11: print("November");
        case 12: print("December");   
    }
    println(" is a great month");
} 
```
