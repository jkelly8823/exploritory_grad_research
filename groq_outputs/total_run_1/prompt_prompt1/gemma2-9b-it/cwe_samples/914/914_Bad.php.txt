VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: SQL Injection
EXPLANATION: 
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly inserts user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper sanitization. The `buildQuery()` function is not shown, but it likely constructs a query that incorporates the values of `$user` and `$pass`. An attacker could craft malicious input for `$user` and `$pass` that alters the intended SQL query, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete data from the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Parameterize Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user input into SQL strings. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code.

2. **Sanitize Input:** Even with parameterized queries, it's good practice to sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters.

3. **Use a Database Abstraction Layer (DAL):** A DAL can help enforce best practices for database interaction and make it easier to prevent SQL injection.
ORIGINAL CODE: 
 
                     //Log user in, and set $isAdmin to true if user is an administrator
                     
                     function login($user,$pass){$query = buildQuery($user,$pass);mysql_query($query);if(getUserRole($user) == "Admin"){$isAdmin = true;}}
                     $isAdmin = false;extract($_POST);login(mysql_real_escape_string($user),mysql_real_escape_string($pass));));
