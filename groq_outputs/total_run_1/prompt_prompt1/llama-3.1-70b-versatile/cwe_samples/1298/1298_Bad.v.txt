VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to data-dependent timing variations and can cause glitches in the output signal z.

EXPLANATION:
The 2x1 multiplexor designed using logic gates has a common issue with combinational logic circuits - they are prone to glitches when dealing with continuous logical operations. The given design can be affected by short-term voltage spikes or "glitches" on the output line z, particularly when both inputs and_out1 and and_out2 tend to be true for short periods. This occurs because output signal z is generated from a combination of the and_out1 and and_out2 signals, using an OR operation. When these signals experience both logical 0 and logical 1 values simultaneously for a brief duration due to signal propagation, a logic error "glitch" occurs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Clock the outputs: Introduce a D-Flip Flop for registering the output to ensure that output only changes when there is a clock pulse, not immediately after input transitions.

```vhdl
reg enable;
always @ (posedge clk)
    enable <= 1'b1;
always @ (enable)
    assign z = enable ? and_out1 | and_out2 : 0;
```

2. Create a redundant redundant logic: Apply a T-gate method - that delays one of the inputs and places it in parallel with its complementary component - effectively removing the 'output hazards'.

```vhdl
wire and_out1_red, and_out2_red;
assign and_out1_red = not_sel & in0;
assign and_out2_red = sel & in1;
assign z = and_out1 | and_out2_red;
assign z = ~z & not_sel & in0 | z & (and_out1 & not_sel | ~and_out1 & in0);
```
OR 
3. Analyze critical paths: One can reduce the critical path using synthesis directives to assign an equivalent low-glitch component equivalent using library modules, or select cells where V (or -) or hVth occur to set the state output timing.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
// 2x1 Multiplexor using logic-gates
 module glitchEx(
 input wire in0, in1, sel,
 output wire z
 );
 wire not_sel;
 wire and_out1, and_out2;
 
 assign not_sel = ~sel;
 assign and_out1 = not_sel & in0;
 assign and_out2 = sel & in1;
 
 // Buggy line of code:
 assign z = and_out1 | and_out2; // glitch in signal z
 
 endmodule
```
