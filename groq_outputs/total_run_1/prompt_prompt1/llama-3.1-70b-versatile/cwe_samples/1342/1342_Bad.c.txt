VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability through Pointer Arithmetic

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to incorrect pointer arithmetic. On line 4, the code performs an operation that assigns an untrusted value to a memory location pointed by `arg_copy`. Although this could potentially be a vulnerability depending on the source of `untrusted_arg`, a more significant issue exists on line 5.

On line 5, the code uses the dereferenced `trusted_ptr` (which could be a trusted value) to calculate an index into the `array`. However, since `**trusted_ptr` can still potentially be very large due to an unchecked multiplication with 4096 and does not perform bounds checking, an out-of-bounds access could occur. 

An adversary with control over either `untrusted_arg` or `trusted_ptr` could cause a segmentation fault or potentially execute arbitrary code by overflowing the stack, making this a more serious vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and constrain the input value for `untrusted_arg`. Either truncate/sanitize this value to prevent excessively large inputs or utilize input validation to assert it lies within expectations.
2. Perform bounds checking on the calculated index before accessing the `array`.
3. Consider employing address space layout randomization and data execution prevention to mitigate potential exploitation.
4. Review the intended behavior and design for `trusted_ptr` and `arg_copy` to ensure they adhere to trusted data and usage expectations.
5. Refactor code for proper memory allocation and indexing in `array`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
void call_victim(size_t untrusted_arg) {
  *arg_copy = untrusted_arg;
  array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];
}
