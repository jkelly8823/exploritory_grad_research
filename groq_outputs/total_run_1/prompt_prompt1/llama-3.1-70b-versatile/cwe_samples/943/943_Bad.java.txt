VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
LDAP Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to LDAP injection. LDAP injection is an attack technique that takes advantage of applications that construct LDAP queries with user-supplied input, without properly validating or sanitizing the input. The user input 'address' is concatenated directly into the search filter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious LDAP search queries. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or filtering methods that can help prevent LDAP injection. 

Instead of concatenating the user input into the search filter, consider using an LDAP filter that allows for parameterized input. The `javax.naming.DirContext` class and its implementations do not support parameterized queries in the same way as SQL-based systems, but the input can still be safely handled with the use of `String.format` for fixed role-based searching queries. For more complex search scenarios, other components can ensure filtering and escaping when binding query parameters. Always thoroughly validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks. Additionally, limit the permissions of the service account making the LDAP queries to only those necessary for its role.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
context = new InitialDirContext(env); 
String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address; 
NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);
```
