VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Information Exposure Through an Error Message. It catches an exception, but then it echoes the exception message, which can contain sensitive information about the application's internal workings, such as database connection strings or file paths.

EXPLANATION:
The code catches an exception and then prints its message along with the location of a configuration file. While this may be intended for debugging purposes, it can inadvertently expose sensitive information about the application's internal workings, such as database connection strings or file paths, which can be valuable to attackers. Furthermore, including the location of the configuration file in the error message might hint that the configuration file itself might contain confidential information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of echoing the exception message and configuration file location, consider logging the exception message to a secure log file. This allows developers to be notified of the exception and investigate its cause, while preventing sensitive information from being exposed to potential attackers. Additionally, consider obscuring or avoiding including the configuration file location in the error message if an exception occurs. If logging or displaying error messages is required, only display general information that is not specific to the internal workings of the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:


try {openDbConnection();}
//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
