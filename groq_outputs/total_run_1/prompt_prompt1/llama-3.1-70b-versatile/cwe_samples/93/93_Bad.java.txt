VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Log Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The given line of code contains a potential Log Injection Vulnerability. This occurs when untrusted data (in this case, `request.getParameter("streetAddress")`) is inserted into a logging message without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious data, allowing them to inject malicious logging events, or even control the format of the logging message.

Furthermore, if the logging system processes the malicious data as an actual log entry with fields (like JSON or XML), this could also allow for data injection attacks against the logging system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid inserting untrusted data directly into logging messages.
2. Use parameterized logging statements to avoid log injection. 
Here's how to correctly log the requested information:

```java
logger.info("User's street address: {}", request.getParameter("streetAddress"));
```

This code ensures that the request parameter is treated as data, and not as part of the logging statement itself.

ORIGINAL CODE:
logger.info("User's street address: " + request.getParameter("streetAddress"));
