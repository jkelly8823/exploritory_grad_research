VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability and also ignores the null pointer check. However, the primary focus here is on a potential buffer overflow vulnerability which is likely to be difficult to exploit but is accompanied by an additional bug. In the error condition where `index` exceeds `len`, it prints out the value at `array[index]`. Even though array index is "invalid", the operation at this invalid index occurs before its associated error condition value is supplied.


EXPLANATION:
The function `getValueFromArray` does perform a bounds check on the array index; however, in the case where the index exceeds the length of the array, it attempts to access the array at the specified index. This is where the vulnerability lies and will potentially lead to a segmentation fault or unexpected behavior, but executing the error operation at the potentially invalid memory location is definitely the flaw and exploitation is quite likely trivial in real-life instances utilizing direct output of resultant values from functions as shown above and utilizing injected input from invalid user data.



RECOMMENDATIONS:
Don't perform the `printf` call in the `else` condition; an error message like `printf("Invalid index specified.\n");` should be provided and avoid the direct access of `array[index]` because it leads to invalid memory location access.


Here is possible corrected code snippet for the described bug above but bear in mind using error handling directly for array access might be more effective and easier for such programs like using exceptions or global error variable and setting it in else case!



```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value = -1;
    // check that the array index is less than the maximum
    // length of the array
    if (index < len) {
        // get the value at the specified index of the array
        value = array[index];
    }
    else {
        // in this case we're in invalid access and avoid accessing array
        printf("Invalid index specified.\n");
    }
    return value;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value;
    // check that the array index is less than the maximum
    // length of the array
    if (index < len) {
        // get the value at the specified index of the array
        value = array[index];
    }
    // if array index is invalid then output error message
    // and return value indicating error
    else {printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);value = -1;}
    return value;
}
