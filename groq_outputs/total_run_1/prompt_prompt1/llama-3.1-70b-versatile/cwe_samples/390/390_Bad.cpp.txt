VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A memory leak and resource leak vulnerability, as well as a lack of proper error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The given function, `readfile`, opens a file, reads its contents into a dynamically allocated array, and returns this array. However, there are several issues:

1.  **Memory leak**: The function dynamically allocates memory with `new char[length]`, but this memory is not freed if an exception occurs between the allocation and the `return buffer` statement. Even if `buffer` is used correctly by the caller, the allocated memory needs to be freed eventually to avoid memory leaks.
2.  **Resource leak**: The file is correctly closed if it can be opened and read successfully. However, if an exception occurs when trying to open the file, the file may not be closed. If an exception occurs after the file has been opened, the file will be closed when the stream is destroyed. Nevertheless, a more explicit error handling strategy could be beneficial for ensuring that resources are properly released.
3.  **Inadequate error handling**: If an exception occurs during file reading or memory allocation, the catch-all block simply ignores the exception without taking any corrective action. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes, as the function returns without indicating an error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the issues:

*   **Use smart pointers**: Consider using smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to manage dynamically allocated memory. These pointers automatically free the allocated memory when they go out of scope, preventing memory leaks.
*   **Close the file in a finally block**: Consider using a try/finally block to ensure that the file is always closed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
*   **Implement proper error handling**: In the catch block, consider logging the exception and letting the caller know that an error occurred. It could be preferred to rethrow the exception instead of catching all exceptions and not taking any action.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
char* readfile (char *filename) {
    try {
        // open input file
        ifstream infile;
        infile.open(filename);
        if (!infile.is_open()) {
            throw "Unable to open file " + filename;
        }
        // get length of file
        infile.seekg(0, ios::end);
        int length = infile.tellg();
        infile.seekg(0, ios::beg);
        // allocate memory
        char *buffer = new char [length];
        // read data from file
        infile.read(buffer, length);
        if (!infile.good()) {
            throw "Unable to read from file " + filename;
        }
        infile.close();
        return buffer;
    }catch (...) {/* bug: insert code to handle this later */}
}
