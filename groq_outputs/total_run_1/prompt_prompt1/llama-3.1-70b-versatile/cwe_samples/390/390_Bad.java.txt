VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a potential Path Traversal vulnerability. The filename parameter is directly used to create a File object without any validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access and read any file on the system, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure or further exploitation.
EXPLANATION:
The issue here is that the filename parameter is not validated or sanitized before being used to create a File object. This means that an attacker could provide a specially crafted filename that traverses upwards in the directory structure (e.g., using "../" or "\\..\\") to access and read files outside of the intended directory.

For example, if the application expects to read files from a directory "/files", an attacker could provide a filename like "../../etc/passwd" to access a sensitive file outside of the intended directory.

Additionally, the use of a generic Exception handler that does nothing also contributes to the vulnerability. This could mask any errors that occur during file access, making it more difficult to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Perform input validation and sanitization on the filename parameter to ensure that it only contains expected characters and does not contain any path traversal sequences.
2. Use a whitelist-based approach to ensure that the filename only contains allowed characters and does not begin with a dot-dot or backslash sequence.
3. Consider using a safer file loading mechanism, such as a FileIO framework that provides built-in path traversal protection.
4. Avoid using generic Exception handlers that do nothing. Instead, handle specific exceptions that can be handled properly, and re-throw or log any other exceptions that may occur.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String readFile(String filename) {
    String retString = null;
    try {
        // initialize File and FileReader objects
        File file = new File(filename);
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
        // initialize character buffer
        long fLen = file.length();
        char[] cBuf = new char[(int) fLen];
        // read data from file
        int iRead = fr.read(cBuf, 0, (int) fLen);
        // close file
        fr.close();
        retString = new String(cBuf);

    } catch (Exception ex) {/* do nothing, but catch so it'll compile... */}
    return retString;
}
```
