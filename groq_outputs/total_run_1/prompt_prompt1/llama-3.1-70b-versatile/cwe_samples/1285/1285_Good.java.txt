VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to 'Variable Shadowing' and 'Unused Variable'.

EXPLANATION:
In the displayProductSummary method, a local variable named 'productSummary' is declared. However, inside the try-catch block, another local variable with the same name is declared, but this new variable is only accessible within the try block. The outer 'productSummary' variable remains empty and is returned, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. This is known as variable shadowing.

Moreover, the variable 'productSummary' declared within the try block is assigned a value but is never used outside that scope. Instead, the method returns the outer 'productSummary' which is an empty string. This is a sign of unused code and may lead to bugs and maintenance issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the inner 'productSummary' variable should be removed and the value should be assigned to the outer 'productSummary' variable. Here's the corrected code:

```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = ""; 
    try {
        productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
```

Alternatively, you can remove the unnecessary variable altogether and directly return the result from the 'getProductSummary' method.

```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    try {
        return getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {
        String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = "";
    if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {
        productSummary = products[index];
    } else {
        System.err.println("index is out of bounds");
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    return productSummary;
}
```
