VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This occurs because the method `getProductSummary` does not validate the input `index` before using it to access an array.

EXPLANATION:
The `displayProductSummary` method does not handle the scenario where the `index` is out of bounds or invalid. When this method calls `getProductSummary`, it does not handle potential exceptions that could occur due to an invalid index. This is a vulnerability because it can lead to an exception being thrown, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing the program to crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add bounds checking: Validate the `index` parameter in `getProductSummary` method to ensure it is within a valid range for the `products` array. You can use a simple if-statement to check if the index is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the array.

2. Handle potential exceptions: Instead of catching a general `Exception` in the `displayProductSummary` method, catch specific exceptions that could potentially occur, such as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or `NullPointerException`.

Here's an example of how the modified code could look like:

```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {
        if (index >= 0 && index < products.length) {
            String summary = getProductSummary(index);
            if (summary != null) {
                productSummary = summary;
            }
        } else {
            // Handle invalid index
            productSummary = "Invalid product index";
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // Handle other exceptions
        productSummary = "An error occurred while retrieving product summary";
    }
    return productSummary;
}

public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    return products[index];
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {
        String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
    }
    return productSummary;
}

public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    return products[index];
}
```
