VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `sscanf` function reads input from the `buf` variable into the `num` and `size` variables. However, there is no validation on the values of `num` and `size` before they are used to index the `sizes` array. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if an attacker sends a large value for `num` that exceeds the bounds of the `sizes` array.

In this case, the `num` variable is not checked to ensure it is within the bounds of the `sizes` array before being used to index the array. This means that if an attacker sends a large value for `num`, they could potentially overwrite memory outside the bounds of the `sizes` array, leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add bounds checking on the `num` variable before using it to index the `sizes` array. You should ensure that `num` is within the range of the array size before writing to it. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```
if (sscanf(buf, "%d %d", &num, &size) == 2 && num >= 1 && num <= count) {
    sizes[num - 1] = size;
}
```

Note that in this example, I assumed that the `count` variable is the size of the `sizes` array. You should replace `count` with the actual size of the `sizes` array.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* capture the sizes of all messages */
int getsizes(int sock, int count, int *sizes) {
    ...char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];int ok;int num, size;
       
       // read values from socket and added to sizes array
       while ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) == 0){
          
         
          // continue read from socket until buf only contains '.'
          if (DOTLINE(buf))break;
          else if (sscanf(buf, "%d %d", &num, &size) == 2)sizes[num - 1] = size;
       
       }...
    
 }
```
