VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A wildcard (*) is used in the allow-access-from directive to allow access from all domains, which may lead to malicious activity being conducted through the application.

EXPLANATION:
The evaluated code contains a cross-domain policy that grants access from all domains (*) in addition to example.com. The presence of a wildcard domain allowance (*) introduces a potential security risk. The allow-access-from directive specifies which domains are allowed to access the server, and using * grants access to all domains, rather than specifically stating trusted domains.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Limiting the allow-access-from directive to specific domains is recommended for security. If allowing access from all domains is required, you should take into account other security measures such as limiting XML access and implementing Content Security Policy (CSP). A better approach is to list down specific domains instead of allowing access from all (*) and removing unnecessary domains that could pose a risk.
