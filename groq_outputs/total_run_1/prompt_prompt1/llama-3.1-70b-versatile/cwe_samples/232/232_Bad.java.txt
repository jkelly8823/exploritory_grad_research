VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly sets a user-provided input (`address`) into a SQL prepared statement using `setString(1, address)`. The issue arises from the fact that the address field is not sanitized and is directly injected into the SQL statement. Although the code appears to be using a prepared statement, the '?' is misplaced in the original string and does not protect against malicious input. A malicious attacker could manipulate the `address` parameter to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data tampering or database compromise.

Additionally, there seems to be a missing assignment of the preparedStatement to `emailAddressPreparedStatement` variable after setting the parameter and this could be the reason of syntax error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries correctly: Ensure that the '?' place holder for the SQL query is placed at the correct position where the address parameter will be passed.

2. Validate and sanitize user input: Use a whitelist approach to validate user input (in this case, `address`) to prevent malicious data from being injected into the database.

3. Prepare the statement with parameters outside the SQL query: Avoid directly concatenating user input with SQL code.

Here's a corrected version of the provided code:

```java
String address = request.getParameter("address");
address = address.trim();

String updateString = "UPDATE shippingInfo SET address = ? WHERE email = ?";

PreparedStatement emailAddressPreparedStatement = con.prepareStatement(updateString);
emailAddressPreparedStatement.setString(1, address);
emailAddressPreparedStatement.setString(2, "cwe@example.com");

// then execute the statement
emailAddressPreparedStatement.executeUpdate();

// do not forget to close resources 
emailAddressPreparedStatement.close();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String address = request.getParameter("address");
address = address.trim();
String updateString = "UPDATE shippingInfo SET address='?' WHERE email='cwe@example.com'";
PreparedStatement emailAddressPreparedStatement = con.prepareStatement(updateString);
emailAddressPreparedStatement.setString(1, address);
```
