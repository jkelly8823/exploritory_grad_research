VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in this code is an SQL Injection vulnerability. This occurs because user input (eid) is directly appended to a SQL query string, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises from the line `string query = "select * from emp where id=" + eid;` where user-provided input `eid` is directly concatenated to a SQL query string without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `eid` value. If an attacker can inject malicious SQL code, they can potentially extract sensitive data, modify or delete data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities, it is essential to separate the SQL query from the user input data using parameterized queries or prepared statements. Here's an example of how the code can be fixed:
```csharp
string query = "SELECT * FROM emp WHERE id = @id";
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", eid);
sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
```
In this revised example, the SQL query and user input data are separated, and a parameterized query is used to avoid SQL Injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
<%protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label EmployeeName;...string query = "select * from emp where id=" + eid;sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);sda.Fill(dt);string name = dt.Rows[0]["Name"];...EmployeeName.Text = name;%><p><asp:label id="EmployeeName" runat="server" /></p>
```
