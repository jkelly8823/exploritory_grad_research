VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a SQL Injection attack. 

EXPLANATION:
The input variable 'eid' is not properly validated and sanitized before it is used directly in the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input. The query string is concatenated with the 'eid' variable using the '+' operator, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent SQL Injection attacks, use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL query string. This will ensure that the input is properly sanitized and escaped, and that the query cannot be injected with malicious SQL code.

Here's an example of how the code can be modified to use a prepared statement:

```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from emp where id=?");
pstmt.setInt(1, eid);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
<%Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);if (rs != null) {rs.next();String name = rs.getString("name");}%>
                  Employee Name: <%= name %>
               ```
