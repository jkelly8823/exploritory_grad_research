VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly inserts user input (request.getParameter("eid")) into the webpage without proper sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the "eid" parameter to inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed by the browser when the webpage is loaded. This can lead to various security issues, including sensitive data theft, hijacked user sessions, and malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should escape or encode the user input before displaying it on the webpage. Here are a few ways to do this:

1. Use a web framework that automatically escapes user input.
2. Use a dedicated library like OWASP's ESAPI to escape user input.
3. Manually escape user input using a function like String's `replace()` method.

Here's an updated code snippet that uses manual escaping:

```java
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>
...Employee ID: <%= eid.replace("<", "&lt;").replace(">", "&gt;") %>
```

However, it is recommended to use a proven and well-maintained library to ensure effective protection against XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>...Employee ID: <%= eid %>
```
