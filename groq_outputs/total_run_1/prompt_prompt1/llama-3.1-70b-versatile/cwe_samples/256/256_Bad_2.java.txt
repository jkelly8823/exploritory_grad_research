VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (as this is a properties file, not a code snippet)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure storage of sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The provided ResourceBundle properties file contains sensitive information such as LDAP username and password in plain text. Storing sensitive information in this manner can be a security vulnerability as it could be easily accessed by unauthorized parties, either through direct access to the file or by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive information securely using a secure storage mechanism, such as:

- Environment variables: Store the credentials as environment variables and retrieve them in the application.
- Secure property files: Use encrypted property files to store sensitive information.
- Secure Key Stores: Use secure key stores such as Java KeyStore or external key management systems to store sensitive information.

Never store sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, in plain text within configuration files.
