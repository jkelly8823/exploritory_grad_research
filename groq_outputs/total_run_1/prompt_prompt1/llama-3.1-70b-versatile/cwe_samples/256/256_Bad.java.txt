VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to clear text password exposure and insecure file input.

EXPLANATION:
The code loads a properties file, 'config.properties', and retrieves a password from it. However, it stores this password in a string variable called 'password'. This is a problem for two reasons: Firstly, this could potentially lead to the password being written to the console or a log file in clear text, thus compromising security. Secondly, using the FileInputStream class directly from an untrusted location (the file system) can expose your code to potential risks, such as reading unexpected data, or modifying file in unexpected ways.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To prevent password exposure, consider using an encryption mechanism like KeyStore to securely store and retrieve passwords. Also, ensure that your password is securely erased from memory once used. This is to prevent it from being exposed through memory dumps or being accessible to the code in an unsecure way.
2. When loading configuration files from a file system, consider using the 'ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()' method to load the properties file. This can protect against file system traversal attacks if the code relies on the classpath.
3. To prevent file input risks, validate the properties filename, by checking if it contains at least a part of the path to the properties file that you control, before passing it to the 'new FileInputStream()' constructor.

ORIGINAL CODE:
               ...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = prop.getProperty("password");DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);...
