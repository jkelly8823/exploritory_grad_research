VULNERABLE: NO
However the code is presented with two independent conditions, one true condition and the other potentially using the changed value.

VULNERABLE_LINES: NA 
(However our potential vulnerability exists in line  3 or the subsequent lines dependent on line 1 logic)

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Null Pointer Check And Possible Unaware Changes

EXPLANATION: This code block initially checks if boolean 'b' is true and assigns "Yes" to 's'. However  there does not appear to be any incorrect use of logic for nulls due to early returning. Use of an existing if condition (s != null) immediately following may prompt concern but initially doesn't check the state in the immediately previous statement above but s can indeed change. Therefore in this isolated scenario, no specific vulnerability was seen

RECOMMENDATIONS: The snippet to be fully reviewed inside a project for any hidden and indirect vulnerability. While no specific case could be found above,  full implementation can have subtle interdependencies changing that.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String s = null;if (b) {s = "Yes";return;}
                     if (s != null) {Dead();}
               
Although this isn't specific vulnerability, having detailed comments and use cases also could further reassure more of code's security soundness
