Predictable Random Number Generation

EXPLANATION:
The use of `srand(time())` in conjunction with `rand()` is a common pattern in generating random numbers. However, using the current time as the seed for the random number generator can lead to predictable random numbers. This is because the current time is often public knowledge and can be easily guessed or calculated. An attacker with knowledge of the seed (in this case, the current time) can replicate the sequence of random numbers, effectively rendering the randomness useless. This is particularly problematic when random numbers are used for security-critical purposes such as generating session IDs, authenticators, or passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate truly unpredictable random numbers. This can be achieved using a platform-specific CSPRNG API, such as `/dev/urandom` on Unix-like systems or `CryptGenRandom` on Windows. Additionally, consider using a seed that is unpredictable and unique, such as a randomly generated number or a hardware-specific identifier.

ORIGINAL CODE:
srand(time()); int randNum = rand();
