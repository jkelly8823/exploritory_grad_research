VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unsecured HTTP Request and Missing Error Handling for IOException.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents several vulnerabilities. Firstly, it uses the HTTP protocol, which is unsecured. HTTP does not provide encryption, making any data transmitted through this connection vulnerable to interception or eavesdropping. Additionally, it does not handle the case where an IOException is thrown during the execution of the code in the try block. This can lead to potential security issues or even crashes.

Furthermore, the error handling for IOException is incomplete, as it does not provide any information about the cause of the exception. In a production environment, this could lead to difficulties in debugging the issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication. This can be achieved by updating the URL to use "https" scheme instead of "http". 

2. Add proper error handling for IOException. This could include logging the exception or displaying an error message to the user. The catch block should be modified to handle the exception in a more comprehensive manner.

3. Close the OutputStream in a finally block to ensure it is closed regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to fix these vulnerabilities:

 ```
try { 
    URL u = new URL("https://www.secret.example.org/"); 
    HttpURLConnection hu = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection(); 
    hu.setRequestMethod("PUT"); 
    hu.connect(); 
    OutputStream os = hu.getOutputStream(); 
    try {
        // Work with the OutputStream here
    } finally {
        os.close();
    }
    hu.disconnect();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Log the exception or display an error message to the user
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
try {URL u = new URL("http://www.secret.example.org/");HttpURLConnection hu = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection();hu.setRequestMethod("PUT");hu.connect();OutputStream os = hu.getOutputStream();hu.disconnect();}catch (IOException e) {
    //...
}
```
