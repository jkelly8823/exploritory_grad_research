VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to the insecure usage of {StorageAccountName}, which could be related to a Storage Account Injection or Hardcoded credentials vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a JSON configuration for an Azure Storage Account. The "name" attribute contains a template expression {StorageAccountName} that could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the storage account name, possibly injecting malicious values. Moreover, this could imply that there is a hardcoded or possibly exposed storage account name present elsewhere in the application. This variable could be directly exposing credentials or sensitive information if it is later used with username or authentication credentials.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, we recommend the following:
- Verify the data source and control of `{StorageAccountName}`. Ensure it does not come from untrusted user inputs.
- Store storage account names and credentials securely, ideally as Azure Key Vault or Environment Variables, and inject them securely into the application.
- Validate storage account names to prevent templating injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
{
  "name": "{StorageAccountName}",
  "enableHttpsTrafficOnly": true,
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
