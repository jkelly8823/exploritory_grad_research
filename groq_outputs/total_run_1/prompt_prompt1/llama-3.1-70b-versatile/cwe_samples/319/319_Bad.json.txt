VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a vulnerability related to insecure communication protocol. The 'enableHttpsTrafficOnly' field is set to false, allowing unencrypted HTTP traffic.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability is known as a 'Mixed Content Vulnerability' or 'Insecure Communication'. When 'enableHttpsTrafficOnly' is set to false, the storage account will accept both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This means that data can be transmitted over unencrypted channels, potentially exposing sensitive information to interception or tampering by malicious parties.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this vulnerability, the 'enableHttpsTrafficOnly' field should be set to true, ensuring that only HTTPS traffic is allowed. This will encrypt the data in transit and prevent unauthorized parties from intercepting or tampering with sensitive information.
