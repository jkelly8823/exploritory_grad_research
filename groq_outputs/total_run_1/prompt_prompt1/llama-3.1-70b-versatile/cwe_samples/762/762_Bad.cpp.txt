VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Memory Corruption Due to Incorrect Memory Deallocation

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `new` keyword in C++ to allocate memory for a `BarObj` object, but later it uses the `free` function to deallocate this memory. This is incorrect because `free` is used in C to deallocate memory that was allocated using `malloc`, not `new`. In C++, it is recommended to use the `delete` keyword to deallocate memory that was allocated using `new`. Using `free` to deallocate memory that was allocated with `new` can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the `delete` keyword instead of `free` to deallocate memory that was allocated using `new`. This will ensure that the memory is properly deallocated and that the object's destructor is correctly called. Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    delete ptr;
}
```
Alternatively, it is recommended to use smart pointers, such as `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr`, to manage the object's lifetime. This will eliminate the need for explicit memory deallocation and prevent this type of vulnerability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    free(ptr);
}
```
