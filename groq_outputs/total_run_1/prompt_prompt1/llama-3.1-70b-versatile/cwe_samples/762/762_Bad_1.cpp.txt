VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses a mix of C and C++ memory management functions, which can lead to memory corruption and crashes.

EXPLANATION:
The problem lies in the mix of `malloc` (a C-style memory allocation function) and `delete` (a C++-style deallocation function). `malloc` returns a pointer to memory that was allocated using a different allocation mechanism than what `delete` expects. `delete` expects a pointer that was allocated using the `new` keyword.

Using `delete` on a pointer that was allocated with `malloc` can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, memory corruption, or unexpected behavior. This is because `delete` may not be able to properly deallocate the memory that was allocated by `malloc`, leading to memory leaks or crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to use either C-style memory management functions (`malloc` and `free`) or C++-style memory management functions (`new` and `delete`), but not both for the same memory allocation.

If using C++-style memory management, the corrected code should use `new` instead of `malloc`:
```c
class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = new int;delete ptr;}
```

If using C-style memory management, the corrected code should use `free` instead of `delete`:
```c
class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));free(ptr);}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));delete ptr;}
```
