VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-6/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential memory leak due to an exception that may be thrown after allocating memory with 'new' but before deleting it.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code does not check if 'new' throws an exception before the delete statement is executed. If 'new' throws, the memory allocated for 'ptr' will leak because it is not possible to free this memory as 'ptr' goes out of scope.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Wrap the 'new' and 'delete' in a try-catch block to prevent the program from crashing and to free allocated memory even if an exception occurs.
2. Consider using smart pointers like unique_ptr or shared_ptr in C++ to handle memory management and prevent memory leaks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    delete ptr;
}

Here's an example of how you could refactor this code to use unique_ptr:

```cpp
void foo(){
    std::unique_ptr<BarObj> ptr(new BarObj());
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    // ptr will be automatically deleted even if an exception occurs
}
```
Alternatively, if you still prefer to use raw pointers, you can use a try-catch block to free the memory in case an exception is thrown.

```cpp
void foo() {
    BarObj *ptr = nullptr;
    try {
        ptr = new BarObj();
        /* do some work with ptr here */
    } catch (...) {
        delete ptr;
        throw;  // rethrow the exception to prevent it from being lost
    }
    delete ptr;
}
```
