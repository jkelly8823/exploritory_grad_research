VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential security information disclosure
EXPLANATION:
The segment contains a configuration setting that may pose a potential security risk. Custom error messages can reveal sensitive information about the system, such as file paths or database schema, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain further access or information. The use of a generic error page (YourErrorPage.htm) with customErrors mode set to 'On' is generally secure; however, setting the defaultRedirect to a generic error page does not prevent the potential disclosure of internal error information if an error occurs in the custom error page itself.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To further secure the error handling process, consider the following:

- Ensure that the error page (YourErrorPage.htm) does not contain any sensitive information.
- Implement error logging and monitoring to track and address issues promptly.
- Set the customErrors mode to 'RemoteOnly', allowing detailed error messages to be displayed on the local machine but not remotely.
- Consider implementing a try-catch block in the code to catch and handle exceptions, further reducing the risk of sensitive information disclosure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" />
