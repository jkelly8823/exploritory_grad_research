VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: N/A (entire configuration)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling Configuration

EXPLANATION:
The provided segment of code appears to be from a .NET web.config file, specifically the customErrors configuration. The mode="RemoteOnly" setting indicates that detailed error messages will only be displayed to remote clients (typically testers/dev team), while less informative error messages will be shown to local users (typically users within the same domain). However, this setting does not mitigate potential security risks. 

The actual vulnerability lies in the lack of specificity in how errors are handled for remote users. A more secure approach would be to keep error messages as generic as possible and in no way descriptive of underlying system technology or configuration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Set customErrors mode to "On" to always display generic error messages to all users, and handle detailed error messages through logging or other error handling mechanisms.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />
