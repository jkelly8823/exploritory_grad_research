VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Error Handling
EXPLANATION:
The presence of `<customErrors mode="Off" />` in this configuration indicates that detailed error messages are enabled. When a web application encounters an error, it will display detailed error messages, which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, such as file paths, database connection strings, and server configuration details. This can be exploited by attackers to gain valuable information about the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to set `<customErrors mode="On" />` and provide custom error messages that do not reveal sensitive information. Additionally, consider setting a default error page or a generic error message that does not provide any details about the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  <customErrors mode="Off" />
```
