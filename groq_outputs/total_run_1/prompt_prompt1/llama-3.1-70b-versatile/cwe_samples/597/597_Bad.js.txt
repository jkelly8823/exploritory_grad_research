VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains potential vulnerabilities due to misuse of loose type equality checks and a String object being compared with a primitive string value.

EXPLANATION:
The code is written in JavaScript, and it is evident that the code is comparing values of different types using the strict equality operator (===). In the cases where the comparisons involve the `s4` variable and other values, the code is likely to produce unexpected results because `s4` is an instance of the String object. When comparing a String object with a primitive string value using the strict equality operator, the comparison will always be false, even if the string values are the same. This is because the strict equality operator checks both the type and the value for equality.

The vulnerability arises because the comparisons involve different types (string and number, and String object and string), which will affect the functionality of the application as expected. While the `s4` variable does not directly pose a security risk in this example, this type of comparison can potentially be used in an insecure manner in other contexts (like trusting unsanitized input data), potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Firstly, instead of using the `String` constructor to create a string, use a string literal. The String constructor creates a String object, and it is typically not necessary for ordinary string manipulation.

Secondly, use JavaScript's built-in functions for type-safe string-to-number conversion, like `parseInt()` or `Number()`, or utilize the automatic coercion behavior to compare the string value `s1` (or `s4`) to a number using the loose equality operator (==), but only when certain that `s1` will not be parsed to NaN (this may not be the best approach since it's still not type-safe).

Lastly, it's worth noting that equality checks involving instances of objects (dynamically created using new operator or static object references) generally do not work with these equality operators as they contain context references, in practice referencing two identical looking number values wont refer back to a true condition hence avoiding overwriting other entity.

Here is an improved code version, avoiding type mismatches in equality comparisons:

```javascript
// define variables before use
var i = 65; // a number
var s1 = '65'; // a string literal

// parse or convert string to number for proper comparison.
if (i === parseInt(s1, 10)) {
  document.getElementById("ieq3s1").innerHTML = "(i === s1) is TRUE";
}

// Using string type consistently with s4
s4 = '65'; // assign a primitive string

// Now s4 directly can be used for comparisons.
if (s4 === s1) {
  document.getElementById("s4eq3s1").innerHTML = "(s4 === s1) is TRUE";
}
if (parseInt(s4) === i) {
  document.getElementById("s4eq3i").innerHTML = "(s4 === i) is TRUE";
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<p id="ieq3s1" type="text">(i === s1) is FALSE</p>
<p id="s4eq3i" type="text">(s4 === i) is FALSE</p>
<p id="s4eq3s1" type="text">(s4 === s1) is FALSE</p>
                
var i = 65;
var s1 = '65';
var s4 = new String('65');
                
if (i === s1)
{
document.getElementById("ieq3s1").innerHTML = "(i === s1) is TRUE";
}
                
if (s4 === i)
{
document.getElementById("s4eq3i").innerHTML = "(s4 === i) is TRUE";
}
                
if (s4 === s1)
{
document.getElementById("s4eq3s1").innerHTML = "(s4 === s1) is TRUE";
}
```
