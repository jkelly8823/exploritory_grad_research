VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure comparison of string objects using the '==' operator.

EXPLANATION:
The given code uses the '==' operator to compare two string objects, str1 and str2. However, in Java, this operator compares the memory references of the objects, not their actual content. Even though str1 and str2 contain the same character sequence ("Hello"), the '==' operator may still return false because they are separate objects with different memory references. This is because the compiler does not guarantee that the same string literal will always refer to the same object in memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To securely compare string objects, use the equals() method instead of the '==' operator. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual content of the strings, not their memory references.

Here's how the code should be modified:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = new String("Hello");
if (str1.equals(str2)) {
    System.out.println("str1 == str2");
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
String str1 = new String("Hello");String str2 = new String("Hello");if (str1 == str2) {System.out.println("str1 == str2");}
