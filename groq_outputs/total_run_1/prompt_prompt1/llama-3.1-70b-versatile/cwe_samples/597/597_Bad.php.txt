VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is written in PHP and it compares an integer variable ($i) with a string variable ($s1) using the triple-equals (identical) operator. This operator checks both the value and the type of the variables. Since the types of $i and $s1 are different (integer and string respectively), the comparison using the triple-equals operator is correctly returning FALSE.

The code is handling this scenario correctly and does not pose any security vulnerabilities. The code is also following best practices for comparison in PHP.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as the code is correctly handling type comparison.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
var $i = 65;
var $s1 = "65";
  
if ($i === $s1)
{
  echo '($i === $s1) is TRUE'. "\n";
}
else
{
  echo '($i === $s1) is FALSE'. "\n";
}
```
