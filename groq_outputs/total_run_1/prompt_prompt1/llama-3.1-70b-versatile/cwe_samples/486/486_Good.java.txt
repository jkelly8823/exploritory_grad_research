VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The code uses class equality check using `==` operator, which may lead to Type Spoofing vulnerability or Class Cast manipulation exploit.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code uses the `==` operator to compare the class of `inputClass` with `TrustedClass.class`. This comparison relies on reference equality rather than type equality. The issue arises because the class of an object can be dynamically manipulated using proxy classes, bytecode manipulation, or other techniques. An attacker could potentially create a fake class that extends `TrustedClass` and thus passes the `==` check, resulting in unauthorized access or execution of sensitive code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use the `instanceof` operator instead of the `==` operator to check if an object is an instance of a trusted class. This ensures that the object's class and all its superclasses are correctly checked for equivalence. Alternatively, you can use the `Object.getClass().getName()` method and compare the class names.

Here is the recommended code:
```java
if (inputClass instanceof TrustedClass) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}
```
Alternatively,
```java
if (inputClass.getClass().getName().equals(TrustedClass.class.getName())) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
if (inputClass.getClass() == TrustedClass.class) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
    // ...
}
```
