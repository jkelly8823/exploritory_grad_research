VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Instance of "Trusted Class" Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a "Trusted Class" issue, where it verifies if the input class name matches a predefined "TrustedClassName." This approach assumes that the input class is trusted based solely on its name, which can be easily manipulated or spoofed by an attacker. 

A more reliable way to verify if the input class is trusted would be to use a unique identifier that cannot be altered or tampered with by an attacker, such as a specific interface implementation or a unique marker.

Furthermore, code analysis suggests that this "Trusted Class" check may not be a whitelist check, since there is only one trusted class name specified in this snippet, which could indicate potential errors and unforeseen vulnerabilities related to exception or error handling in cases where multiple or customized classes need to be trusted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of relying solely on the class name for validation, use a unique identifier that can guarantee the class's identity. This can be achieved by:

- Using a specific interface implementation as a marker for trusted classes.
- Employing a unique marker or annotation for trusted classes.
- Verifying the class's identity through a more robust mechanism such as using the fully qualified class name (including package) or ensuring the class has a specific parent class.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to improve security:

```java
// Define a trusted interface
interface TrustedClass {
    // implementation
}

// Instead of relying on class name
if (inputClass instanceof TrustedClass) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}

// Alternatively, if you want to stick with class names
if (inputClass.getClass().getName().equals("com.trustedpackage.TrustedClassName")) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
if (inputClass.getClass().getName().equals("TrustedClassName")) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
}
```
