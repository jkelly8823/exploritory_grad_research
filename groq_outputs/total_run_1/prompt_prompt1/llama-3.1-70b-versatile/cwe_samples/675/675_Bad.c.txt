VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (Due to incomplete code)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A double-free vulnerability may be present.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is incomplete, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact lines where the vulnerability exists. However, it appears that there are two potential instances of calling `free()` on the same pointer (`ptr`). If the `abrt` condition is met before the second `free(ptr)` call, the pointer is freed. Then, when the second `free(ptr)` is reached, an attempt to free an already freed memory block is made, resulting in a double-free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this double-free vulnerability, you should ensure that `free()` is only called once on the `ptr`. You can achieve this by:

1. Checking if `abrt` is set and only freeing the pointer if it is, then setting `ptr` to `NULL` to prevent future double-frees.
2. Using a flag to keep track of whether the pointer is already freed.
3. Ensuring that `free(ptr)` is only called after removing references to the freed memory block.

Here's an example of how you can fix the issue:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);

// ...

if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // Prevent future double-frees
}

// ...

if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
```
