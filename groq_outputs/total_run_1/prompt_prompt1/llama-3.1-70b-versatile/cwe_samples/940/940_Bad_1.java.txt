VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `substring` method to extract a specific part of the URL. However, it does not check if the URL is long enough to extract the desired substrings. If the URL is less than 14 characters long, calling `substring(0, 14)` will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Additionally, if the URL is between 14 and 25 characters long, calling `substring(14, 25)` may also result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Furthermore, this code uses an extremely fragile method of determining the validity of a URL. It relies on exact string lengths rather than the structure of the URL itself, which makes it vulnerable to changes in the URL scheme.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to check the length of the URL before calling the `substring` method. Additionally, a more robust method of determining the validity of the URL should be used, such as parsing the URL into its component parts using the `URI` class.

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to fix these vulnerabilities:

```java
@Override
public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
    try {
        URI uri = new URI(url);
        if (uri.getScheme().equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme")) {
            String path = uri.getPath();
            if (path.contains("getUserInfo")) {
                writeDataToView(view, UserData);
                return false;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
    } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
        // handle the exception
    }
    return true;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
@Override
public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
    if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){writeDataToView(view, UserData);return false;}else{return true;}}
}
```
