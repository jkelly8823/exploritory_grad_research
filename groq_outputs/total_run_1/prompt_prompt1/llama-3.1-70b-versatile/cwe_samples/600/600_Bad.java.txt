VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A Potential DNS Rebinding Attack Vulnerability exists in the code, as it directly uses the 'InetAddress.getByName' method with a user-controlled input (IP address).

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a DNS Rebinding Attack because it uses the 'InetAddress.getByName' method with a user-controlled input (the IP address from 'req.getRemoteAddr'). This input is not validated or sanitized and can be manipulated by an attacker to redirect the DNS lookup to a domain of their choice. This could allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions and access internal resources.

Moreover, directly printing the result of 'addr.getHostName()' without proper validation and sanitization can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to:

1. Validate the IP address from 'req.getRemoteAddr' before passing it to the 'InetAddress.getByName' method to prevent DNS Rebinding Attacks. This can be done by checking the IP address against a whitelist of known trusted addresses or a regular expression validation.

2. Use 'InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName' or other methods to mitigate DNS Rebinding Attacks.

3. Ensure to sanitize any output to prevent information disclosure.

Here is an example of improved code:

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
    String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
    // Assuming isValidIP is a method that validates IP addresses
    if (!isValidIP(ip)) {
        // Handle the case where IP is not valid
    }

    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
    // Try to get the canonical hostname instead of just hostname
    String hostName = addr.getCanonicalHostName();
    // Sanitize the output to prevent information disclosure
    hostName = sanitizeOutput(hostName);
    out.println("hello " + hostName);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
    String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
    ...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}
```
