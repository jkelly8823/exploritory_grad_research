VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This method throws multiple checked exceptions without providing a catch-all clause for the generic Exception or Throwable.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet displays a method that declares it may throw IOException, InvocationTargetException, and SQLException. While declaring these exceptions explicitly is good practice, not providing a catch-all clause can make it difficult for callers to write robust exception handling code. If a caller chooses not to specify a catch for InvocationTargetException, for example, and if InvocationTargetException is thrown but the caller only catches IOException, the IOException catch will not catch the InvocationTargetException and it will propagate up the call stack.

Additionally, unchecked exceptions like RuntimeException, TypeError etc aren't explicitly included in the method signature which might leak if something goes horribly wrong in the method which in turn requires some more handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider aggregating the exceptions and catching them in the method body where you have more context to handle them.
- Include a generic Exception or Throwable in the throws clause to handle unexpected exceptions.
- A further enhancement may be to provide the ability for the caller to decide how exceptions are handled.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public void doExchange() throws IOException, InvocationTargetException, SQLException {...}
