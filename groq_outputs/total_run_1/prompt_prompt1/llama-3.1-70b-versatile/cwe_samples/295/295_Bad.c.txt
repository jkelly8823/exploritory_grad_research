VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate Certificate Verification

EXPLANATION:
The code only checks for two specific verify results from OpenSSL: `X509_V_OK` and `X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`. This means that any other verification errors or warnings are not checked for, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities. The code assumes that a certificate chain error is acceptable, which could lead to security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To properly handle certificate verification, all return codes from `SSL_get_verify_result` should be evaluated. Codes other than `X509_V_OK` should trigger an error or warning. Here's a revised example of how to handle this:
```c
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host) {
    foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if (foo != X509_V_OK) {
        // Handle verification error
        // Print error or handle exception here
    } else {
        // certificate looks good, host can be trusted
    }
}
```
Additionally, a switch statement or a lookup table can be used to handle different verification codes, providing more detailed error messages.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host)foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))
    // certificate looks good, host can be trusted
```
