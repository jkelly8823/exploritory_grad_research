VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Assignment instead of comparison in conditional statement.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses an assignment operator (=) in the conditional statement instead of a comparison operator (==). This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the assignment will always evaluate to true, allowing the code within the if statement to execute, regardless of the actual value of the condition.

Additionally, the variable 'cert' is not used in the conditional statement. Instead, the result of the assignment 'SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))' is used. If the intention is to check if the certificate is valid or not, then it's better to do so explicitly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, replace the assignment operator (=) with a comparison operator (==) if the intention is to compare the result of 'SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))' with another value. Also, it is recommended to check for the return value of SSL_get_peer() and handle the error if it returns NULL.

The corrected code may look like this:
```c
X509* cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    int foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo)) {
         //do stuff
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))
         //do stuff
}
```
