VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential assignment vulnerability in the if statement, where the assignment operator (=) is used instead of the comparison operator (==).

EXPLANATION:
The code is using the assignment operator (=) in the if statement to check if the SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) function returns a non-null value. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior if the assignment itself is evaluated to true or false, depending on the value assigned. In this case, the if condition will always evaluate to true if the assignment is successful, regardless of the actual value returned by the SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) function. This can potentially lead to the code inside the if block being executed when it shouldn't be, or not being executed when it should be.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the comparison operator (==) should be used instead of the assignment operator (=) in the if statement. The correct syntax for this conditional statement would be:
```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // ...
}
```
However, considering the context of the code, the most likely intention is to check if the SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) function returns a non-null value and store it in the cert variable. In that case, the code can be modified as follows:
```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // ...
}
```
This code ensures that the SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) function is called only once, and its return value is checked correctly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got a certificate, do secret things
}
```
