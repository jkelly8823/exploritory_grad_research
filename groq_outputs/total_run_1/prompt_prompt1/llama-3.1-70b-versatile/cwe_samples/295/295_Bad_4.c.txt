VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a single equals sign (=) in the conditional statement, which can lead to a vulnerability. This can cause the certificate check to be bypassed, potentially allowing malicious connections.

EXPLANATION:
The issue here is that in C, a single equals sign (=) is used for assignment, whereas a double equals sign (==) is used for comparison. In this case, the variable `cert` is being assigned the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` and the condition is checking the truthiness of this assignment, rather than comparing the result with a value. This means that the condition will always evaluate to true when the assignment is successful. This can cause the code to incorrectly assume that the certificate is valid.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a comparison operator (==) instead of an assignment operator (=). However, the correct way to do this is to first assign the result to `cert` and then check if it's not NULL. Here's the corrected code:

```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
}
```
