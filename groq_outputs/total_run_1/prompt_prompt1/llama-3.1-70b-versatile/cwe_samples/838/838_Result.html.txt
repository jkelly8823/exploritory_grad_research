VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The given code contains an XSS vulnerability due to the use of a dynamically generated value in the 'onload' attribute of the HTML 'img' tag. The expression 'alert(document.cookie)' is executed when the image is loaded, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. The purpose of this code is likely to steal cookies, which could be used for session hijacking or other malicious activities.

This type of vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker if the image source is changed to something like 'pic.jpg" onerror="malicious_code()"'. The quote in the image source allows the attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, including code that makes requests to remote servers controlled by the attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, do not use dynamic values in the 'onload' attribute. Ensure that all values passed to the 'onload' attribute or any other event handlers are properly validated and sanitized.

Another approach is to use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within an HTML document. By default, CSP disables the execution of JavaScript code within HTML attributes. However, this must be implemented carefully to avoid breaking existing functionality.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <img src='pic.jpg' alt='altTextHere' onload='alert(document.cookie)' />
