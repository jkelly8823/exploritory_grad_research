VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unseeded Random Number Generation and Use of Unsecure Random Number Generation Function.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `rand()` function to generate a random number. However, this function is not suitable for applications that require cryptographically secure random number generation. The use of `rand()` has several issues, including predictability and limited entropy. Additionally, the seed set with `srand` using `time()` can be predicted in some cases.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) such as `std::random_device` and `std::random_number_distribution` in C++ or an equivalent library in other languages.

For example:

```c
#include <random>

std::random_device rd;
std::mt19937 gen(rd());
std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis(0, 100);

int randNum = dis(gen);
```

Alternatively, if strong randomness is required but CSPRNG is not feasible, consider using a better seed and `rand_r` or `stdlib.h` functions specific to your platform.

ORIGINAL CODE:
srand(time());int randNum = rand();
