Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to path traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when a web application uses untrusted data to construct a file path, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this case, the code uses the `getInputPath()` function to get a file path from an untrusted source. It then attempts to validate the path by checking if it starts with "/safe_dir/". However, the `getCanonicalPath()` method is used, which can be manipulated by an attacker to bypass the validation.

The issue is that the `getCanonicalPath()` method returns the actual path on disk, taking into account the file system's naming rules. An attacker can exploit this by providing a path that, when canonicalized, evaluates to a path outside of the intended "/safe_dir/".

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the file path is properly sanitized and validated. This can be achieved by using the `Path` class, which provides a more secure way of working with file paths. Additionally, we should avoid using user-input data to construct file paths.

Here is an example of how to fix the vulnerability:

```java
Path safeDir = Path.of("/safe_dir");
String inputPath = getInputPath();
Path userInputPath = Path.of(inputPath);
Path resolvedPath = safeDir.resolve(userInputPath).normalize();

if (resolvedPath.startsWith(safeDir)) {
    return resolvedPath.toString();
} else {
    // Handle the case where the user input path is not within the safe directory
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String path = getInputPath();
File f = new File(path);
if (f.getCanonicalPath().startsWith("/safe_dir/")) {
    return f.getCanonicalPath();
}
```
