VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code does not use brackets to group statements in the if condition, which can lead to ambiguity in the program flow.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the intention of the programmer is unclear. Without brackets, the if condition will only apply to the statement immediately following it, which is Do_X();. The statement Do_Y(); will be executed regardless of the condition. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to use brackets to group statements that should be executed conditionally. This will make the code more readable and prevent potential bugs. Here is a corrected version:

if (condition==true) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
}

Another good practice is to avoid using equality checks with true in conditional statements. The condition itself can be used as the boolean value. Here is an updated version:

if (condition) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
}

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true) Do_X();Do_Y();
