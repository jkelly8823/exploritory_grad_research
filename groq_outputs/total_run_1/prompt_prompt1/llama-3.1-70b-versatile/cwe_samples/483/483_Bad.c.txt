VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an if statement with missing brackets ({}) that can lead to unexpected behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The given code is using an if statement to conditionally execute the function Do_X. However, the lack of brackets ({}) means that the Do_Y function will be executed regardless of the condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This is because the if statement will be applied only to the Do_X function, and the Do_Y function will be executed unconditionally.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, brackets ({}) should be added to clearly define the scope of the if statement. Here is the corrected code:

if (condition==true) {
  Do_X();
  Do_Y();
}

Alternatively, if the intention is to execute Do_Y regardless of the condition, the code can be rewritten as:

if (condition==true) {
  Do_X();
}
Do_Y();

However, for clarity and maintainability, it is generally better to use the first approach.

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
