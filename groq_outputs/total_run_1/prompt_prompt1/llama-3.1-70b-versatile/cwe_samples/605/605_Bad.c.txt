VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of an uninitialized variable and passing an incorrect argument to the bind function.

EXPLANATION: 
The bind_socket function declares several variables, but it does not initialize all of them properly. Furthermore, when calling the bind function, it uses 's1' which seems to be an undeclared variable. It should use the address of the 'server_address' variable instead.

Additionally, error checking is missing when calling system functions like 'unlink', 'socket', and 'bind'. If these functions fail, they return error values, but the function in the given code doesn't handle them.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Check the return values of 'unlink', 'socket', and 'bind' and handle them accordingly to prevent unintended behavior.
- Initialize the 's1' variable or use the 'server_address' variable instead when calling the bind function.
- Use proper error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and security of the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  void bind_socket(void) {
                        
                           int server_sockfd;int server_len;struct sockaddr_in server_address;
                           
                           /*unlink the socket if already bound to avoid an error when bind() is called*/
                           
                           unlink("server_socket");server_sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
                           server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;server_address.sin_port = 21;server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);server_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
                           bind(server_sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &s1, server_len);
                     }
