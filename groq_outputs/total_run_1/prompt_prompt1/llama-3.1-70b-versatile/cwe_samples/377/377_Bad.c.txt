VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5 (temporary assumption as line numbers not provided)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential arbitrary file write vulnerability due to insecure use of `tmpnam_r` and unchecked `fopen` operation.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `tmpnam_r` to generate a temporary filename, but it does not properly handle potential errors or malicious behavior. If the generation of the temporary filename fails or is compromised, the subsequent `fopen` operation may open an unexpected file, leading to an arbitrary file write vulnerability. Additionally, the code does not check for errors after `fopen`, which can also lead to unexpected behavior.

Furthermore, the code uses the `fwrite` function to write received data directly to the file without any validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to a data corruption or unauthorized data access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Perform proper error checking for `tmpnam_r` to ensure it generates a valid temporary filename.
2.  Check the return value of `fopen` to ensure the file is opened successfully and securely.
3.  Validate and sanitize the received data before writing it to the file using `fwrite`.
4.  Consider using a more secure temporary file generation mechanism, such as `mkstemp`, which allows for safer temporary file creation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (tmpnam_r(filename)) {
    FILE* tmp = fopen(filename,"wb+");while((recv(sock,recvbuf,DATA_SIZE, 0) > 0)&(amt!=0)) amt = fwrite(recvbuf,1,DATA_SIZE,tmp);
}
```
