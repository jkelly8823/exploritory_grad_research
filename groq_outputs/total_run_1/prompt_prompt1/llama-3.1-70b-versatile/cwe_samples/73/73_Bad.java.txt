VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The code takes an untrusted input (reportName) from the request parameter and appends it to a file path. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path by providing a sequence of '../' which can traverse the directory tree. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive files or even directory traversal exploitation to delete or modify critical system files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the input from the request parameter is properly sanitized and validated before using it in file operations. 

Here are some recommendations:
1. Use a whitelist approach: Only allow specific file names that are expected and known to be safe.
2. Use a validation mechanism: Validate the input against a predefined pattern and ensure it does not contain any malicious characters.
3. Use a canonical file path: Use a library that can normalize file paths, ensuring that '../' and other directory traversal sequences are resolved correctly.

ORIGINAL CODE:

String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
...rFile.delete();

Note: Consider using a templating engine for file paths or using a safer way of storing and retrieving files such as storing the file names in a database and generating random file names for security.
