VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (properties file)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure storage of sensitive information in a plain text properties file.

EXPLANATION:
The provided ResourceBundle properties file contains sensitive information such as username and password in plain text. This is a significant security risk because an unauthorized person with access to this file can obtain sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the LDAP system. Properties files are not meant to store sensitive data and are often not encrypted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure sensitive information, it is recommended to store them in a secure manner, such as:
1. Environment Variables: Store sensitive information in environment variables instead of properties files. This way, sensitive data is not hardcoded in the properties file.
2. Encrypted Properties Files: Use an encryption mechanism to store sensitive information in properties files. This way, even if an unauthorized person gains access to the properties file, they will not be able to read the sensitive data.
3. Secure Configuration Files: Use a secure configuration file mechanism, such as a KeyStore or a Secure Configuration Service, to store sensitive information.
4. Externalize Configuration: Consider using an external configuration management tool, such as HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to securely store and manage sensitive information.
