VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This function contains a buffer overflow vulnerability, in addition to insufficient error checking and the use of a deprecated function.

EXPLANATION:
The function `VerifyAdmin` takes a `char *password` as an argument, but the function does not check the length of the password before passing it to the `compress` function and then `strcmp` function. If the password is too long, this can lead to a buffer overflow. 

Additionally, this function uses `strcmp` for validating passwords which is also not recommended. This is because the comparison of two strings returns 0 if they are identical and non-zero otherwise, and since password comparison is typically done differently than string comparison, more sophisticated comparison is needed.

Lastly, the `strcmp` function may throw a segmentation fault or return incorrect results if `compress(password)` or `compressed_password` is a null pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure this function, it is recommended to limit the password length before passing it to the `compress` function. Also, use `strncmp` with a specified length and error checking with `NULL` values to make sure the function does not throw any segmentation faults.

One way to fix this function is by doing something like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define PASSWORD_MAX_LENGTH 256
#define HASH_LENGTH 256

int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (password == NULL || strlen(password) > PASSWORD_MAX_LENGTH) {
        printf("Password too long or null!\n");
        return 0;
    }

    char *password_hash = compress(password);

    if (password_hash == NULL) {
        printf("Error: compression failed!\n");
        return 0;
    }

    if (strncmp(password_hash, compressed_password, HASH_LENGTH) != 0) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return 0;
    }

    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
    return 1;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (strcmp(compress(password), compressed_password)) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return(0);
    }
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
    return(1);
}
```
