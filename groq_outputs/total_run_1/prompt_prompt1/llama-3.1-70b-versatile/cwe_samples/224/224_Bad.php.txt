VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and TOCTOU (Time of Check to Time of Use) vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal and TOCTOU attacks. The `readFile` function does not properly sanitize the input filename, which could be used to traverse the file system and access sensitive files. The `is_link` and `fileowner` functions are used to check the ownership of the file, but these checks can be bypassed by creating a symbolic link to a sensitive file. 

In addition, the `readFile` function suffers from a TOCTOU vulnerability. The `fileowner` check is done before the `echo file_get_contents($realFile)` statement, but this creates a window of opportunity for an attacker to modify the file ownership or create a new symbolic link after the check has been made but before the file is accessed. This could lead to an attacker accessing a sensitive file.

The `getCurrentUser` function is also assumed to return the current user's ID, but the actual implementation is not shown here. This could also introduce vulnerabilities if it's not implemented correctly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always use absolute file paths when dealing with file operations.
2. Validate the input filename to ensure it's within the expected directory structure and does not contain any malicious characters.
3. Use `realpath` function to get the actual path of the file and perform checks on it.
4. Avoid using `fileowner` for authentication as it can be easily bypassed. Instead, use a more robust authentication mechanism.
5. Implement least privilege access for the user running the script.
6. Log all file accesses and errors for auditing and debugging purposes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();$realFile = $filename;

    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
}
```
