VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate form names

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code segment, we have a `form-validation` element containing a `formset` with two forms having the same name, "ProjectForm". This can lead to unexpected behavior when JavaScript or backend code tries to access these forms by their name. Having multiple elements with the same name can cause confusion and potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect form submissions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, make sure that each form has a unique name. This can be achieved by changing the name attributes of the forms to distinct values.

```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```

Alternatively, if the forms are intended to be related, consider using an array-like naming convention, such as `ProjectForm[]`.

```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm[]"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm[]"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```
