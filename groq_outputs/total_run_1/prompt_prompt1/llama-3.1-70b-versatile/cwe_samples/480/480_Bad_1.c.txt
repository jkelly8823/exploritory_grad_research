VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack in the push function.

EXPLANATION:
The push function increments the p1 pointer before checking if it has exceeded the bounds of the stack array. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack by pushing more elements than the stack can hold. The code checks for stack overflow after incrementing p1, but it does not prevent the overflow from happening. This is a vulnerability because an attacker can cause the program to write data outside the bounds of the stack array, potentially corrupting other data structures or gaining unauthorized access to memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the check for stack overflow should be performed before incrementing the p1 pointer. Additionally, the loop should be changed to equal rather than not equal so that this operation takes place (usually off by one errors). The corrected code for the push function should look like this:

```c
void push(int i) {
    if (p1 == (tos + SIZE)) {
        // Print stack overflow error message and exit
    }
    *p1 = i;
    p1++;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SIZE 50
int *tos, *p1, stack[SIZE];

void push(int i) {
    p1++;
    if (p1 == (tos + SIZE)) {
        // Print stack overflow error message and exit
    }
    *p1 = i;
}

int pop(void) {
    if (p1 == tos) {
        // Print stack underflow error message and exit
    }
    p1--;
    return *(p1 + 1);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // initialize tos and p1 to point to the top of stack
    tos = stack;
    p1 = stack;
    // code to add and remove items from stack
    ...return 0;
}
```
