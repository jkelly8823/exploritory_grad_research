VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure use of assignment operator instead of comparison operator.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided contains an insecure use of the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (==). This can lead to unintended behavior and potentially allow for invalid data to be processed. In the context of the given function, this bug allows any value to be considered valid because the function is always assigning 100 to the variable and then checking if the result is non-zero.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the assignment operator (=) with the comparison operator (==) to correctly verify if the value equals 100. The corrected function should appear as follows:

 isValid(int value) { if (value == 100) { printf("Value is valid\n"); return(1); }printf("Value is not valid\n"); return(0); }

Alternatively, the entire function can be simplified and written more securely by comparing the value and handling the conditions in a more idiomatic way:

 isValid(int value) { printf("Value %s valid\n", (value == 100) ? "is" : "is not"); return (value == 100); }

ORIGINAL CODE:
int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
