VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 This code defines a clone method that is protected and may allow malicious subclasses to clone sensitive objects.

EXPLANATION:
 While it may seem harmless, declaring the clone method as protected can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. If this method is intended to override Object.clone() and make it accessible to subclasses, it should be made public. However, if a class containing sensitive state extends this class and calls the clone method, the sensitive information could be vulnerable to unauthorized access through the subclass. Moreover, CloneNotSupportedException could be used to expose or amplify vulnerabilities through attack vectors, by potentially containing enough information to infer application security decisions and therefore may be considered a weakness.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Avoid using `protected` for sensitive methods. If the method doesn't need to override the `clone` method of the `Object` class, it should consider being private. However, if you're choosing to provide a cloning mechanism and a requirement is for it to subclass, then make it public. Ensure the class's documentation clearly expresses that the sub-classes must implement CloneNotSupportedException handling securely given such an architecture where clone may be inherited.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {...}
