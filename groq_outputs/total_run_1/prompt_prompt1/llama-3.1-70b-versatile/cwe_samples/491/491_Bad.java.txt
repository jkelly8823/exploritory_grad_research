VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The clone method incorrectly throws CloneNotSupportedException and also accepts a String parameter accountnumber which doesn't adhere to the standard clone method signature in Java.

EXPLANATION:
The Cloneable interface in Java is used to provide a copy of an object. However, the clone method in the given code does not correctly implement this interface. It should not accept a String parameter (accountnumber) and should check if the class implements Cloneable and then call the clone method from the superclass, or call a deep copy method.

Moreover, throwing CloneNotSupportedException directly in the clone method signature is not the correct way. Instead, the clone method should check if the invoking object's class implements the Cloneable interface, and only if it does, proceed with the cloning, otherwise throw CloneNotSupportedException. This way, the code provides a clear check and makes sure it's dealing with an object which can be cloned.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Firstly, remove the parameter (accountnumber) from the clone method to correctly implement the standard clone method. Then modify the clone method to verify if the class implements the Cloneable interface and throw CloneNotSupportedException when needed.

```java
@Override
public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    if (!(this instanceof Cloneable)) {
        throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Clone not supported on this object");
    }
    // custom cloning logic
    return new BankAccount(/*parameters to init new object*/);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class BankAccount implements Cloneable {
    public Object clone(String accountnumber) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = new BankAccount(account number);
        // ...
    }
}
```
