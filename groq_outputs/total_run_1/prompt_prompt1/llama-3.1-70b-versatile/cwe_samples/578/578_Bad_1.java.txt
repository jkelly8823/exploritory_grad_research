VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a runtime ClassLoader Attack where malicious code can be loaded by a custom ClassLoader.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses a custom ClassLoader to dynamically load a class named "someClass". However, this introduces a security risk as the ClassLoader can load any class, including malicious ones, into the application. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application at runtime, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data tampering. Furthermore, the instantiation of the loaded class using `newInstance()` can lead to additional vulnerabilities if the loaded class's constructor or other methods are exploited.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Validate the loaded class before instantiating it. Ensure that the class is a trusted, whitelisted class.
2. Avoid using dynamic class loading whenever possible. Instead, consider using a more traditional approach to loading classes, such as using a well-known class name or loading a class from a trusted source.
3. Ensure that the custom ClassLoader is configured to only load classes from trusted sources (e.g., a specific package or JAR file).
4. Implement additional security checks on the loaded class instance, such as verifying that it is an instance of a specific interface or class.
5. Consider using a more secure class loading mechanism, such as the Java Module System, which provides better isolation and security features.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
@Stateless
public class LoaderSessionBean implements LoaderSessionRemote {
    public LoaderSessionBean() {
        try {
            ClassLoader loader = new CustomClassLoader();
            Class c = loader.loadClass("someClass");
            Object obj = c.newInstance();
            /* perform some task that uses the new class instance member variables or functions */
            ...
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ...
        }
    }
    public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    }
}
