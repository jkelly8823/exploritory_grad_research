VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8, 16-18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference (IDOR) and file permissions weakness.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not properly handle file creation and permissions. Specifically, the createAdminFileIfNotExists function creates a file without checking its existence beforehand, which may cause issues if the file already exists and has different permissions. Additionally, the changeModeOfAdminFile function sets a fixed file mode, which may not be suitable for all environments. A more significant concern is that this code can be used to set permissions of arbitrary files by modifying the adminFile variable. This can potentially allow a malicious actor to manipulate file permissions.

The use of a hardcoded file path and mode may not be suitable for all environments, and the code does not handle potential errors that may occur during file creation and permissions changes. Furthermore, the code does not validate whether the file exists before attempting to change its mode.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, it is recommended that the code be modified to:
1. Check for file existence before attempting to create or modify it.
2. Validate the file path to prevent IDOR.
3. Implement least privilege access, so the code does not modify permissions of files it is not intended to.
4. Use more secure and flexible ways of handling file permissions, such as using secure defaults and allowing the user or administrator to customize permissions as necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
const adminFile = "/etc/admin-users"
func createAdminFileIfNotExists() error {
    file, err := os.Create(adminFile)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil
}

func changeModeOfAdminFile() error {
    fileMode := os.FileMode(0440)
    if err := os.Chmod(adminFile, fileMode); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil
}
```
