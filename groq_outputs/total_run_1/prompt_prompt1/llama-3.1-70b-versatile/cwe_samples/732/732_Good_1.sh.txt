VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Public exposure of a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket through overly permissive IAM policies.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates commands that modify the IAM policies of a GCS bucket. The `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` groups are special groups that grant access to either anyone on the internet (allUsers) or anyone with a Google account (allAuthenticatedUsers). By granting the `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` group default access to the bucket, this code effectively makes the bucket's contents publicly accessible. This exposure could potentially lead to unintended access, data breaches, or abuse.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Limit access to the GCS bucket by specifying more specific identities or groups, rather than granting access to broad, predefined groups. Ensure that the principle of least privilege (POLP) is followed, and that only the necessary permissions are granted. Consider using more granular access control options, such as service accounts or custom IAM roles, to restrict access.

Before applying the IAM changes, verify that the granted permissions align with the organization's security policies and requirements. Additionally, monitor and regularly review the bucket's access logs to detect any suspicious activity.

Original code modifications for better access control:
```bash
gsutil iam ch -d serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL gs://BUCKET_NAME
```
or
```bash
gsutil iam ch -d group:GROUP_EMAIL gs://BUCKET_NAME
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```bash
gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
```
