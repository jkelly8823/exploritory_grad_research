VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code potentially contains a hardcoded sensitive data vulnerability. 
Although I can infer that "BUCKET_NAME" is likely meant to be replaced with a string literal containing the name of the bucket or its actual name, and not necessarily containing sensitive information as an example, assuming that hardcoded bucket name (or if it were eventually hardcoded)   contains customer-specific identifying data, AWS access credentials  with permissions to access data (if AWS compatible or integration keys are applicable) or can be used to access private or customer-sensitive (or access restricted), assets such as images, static web hosting, or videos.

However due to a variable name such as "BUCKET_NAME" it is not a definitive conclusion since it can and usually does vary - therefore with lack of other variable definition and given potential security intent from such code execution ("iam" might hint toward Identity Access Management), for lack of further context and info on this line - no further explanation might suffice - taking such as Sensitive inferring on possible security.


EXPLANATION:
Although insecure practice in itself when performed in production system (command line where key secrets are "hidden" in command line history file - which gets cleared as soon as you do such action), there is likely very little reason why it should raise much concern even though Identity and Access management comes into play this is more info on given data rather than an action operation than "Read"
This command's response to get information contains permissions on users as part of an access control object, given the permission on an IAM user on individual basis  in order to give user roles that allow access control for view, create operations, even if get command is not doing this you will be able to identify permissions the operation (the "iam get") will give information about in order to get user role rights upon getting bucket permission operation according.

Therefore, we can't rule out data leakage as,  provided that either some process command get history might hold the actual bucket keyword that might expose data / resource information

However bucket names are not always guaranteed to be static - as when devops create or deploy according - all this or example does however is infer some security on basic vulnerability analysis of said bucket with gs being related to data object or object files that could be mapped as so 'iam does.' meaning a set a permissions and group policies will need access definitions in order do to full auditing should some need rise need to do further actions.



RECOMMENDATIONS:
If the variable BUCKET_NAME contains sensitive information, don't directly hard code this value into code. Read this from a secure environment variable or a secure configuration file. Ensure sensitive information and credentials are safely stored and managed.
Make use of CI/CD pipelines secrets, environments, or build-in functionality like AWS Parameter Store or AWS Secret Manager if integration or any code path supports compatibility with this or using any equivalent tool for another service cloud provider managing, and your deployment resource of choice.
