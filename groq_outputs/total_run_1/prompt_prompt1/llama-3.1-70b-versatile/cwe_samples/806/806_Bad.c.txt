VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `strncpy` function is used to copy the string from `source` to `dest`. However, the size of the `dest` array is 12, and the size of the `source` array is 21. The `sizeof(source)-1` expression evaluates to 20. Copying 20 characters from `source` to `dest` can still cause a buffer overflow because `strncpy` does not null-terminate the string when the destination buffer is not large enough. This can cause unintended behavior when the string is printed or used in other string operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the string, including the null-terminator. A safe approach would be to use `strncpy` to copy characters up to the size of the destination buffer minus one, and then explicitly null-terminate the string.

Here is an example of safe code:

```c
...char source[21] = "the character string";char dest[12];size_t dest_size = sizeof(dest) - 1;strncpy(dest, source, dest_size);dest[dest_size] = '\0';...
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
...char source[21] = "the character string";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(source)-1);...
```
