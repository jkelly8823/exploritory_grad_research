VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `strncpy` function is used to copy the filename to the `buf`, but it does not guarantee null-termination of the string.

EXPLANATION:
The `strncpy` function only copies the first `length` characters of the `filename` string to the `buf`. If the `filename` is longer than or equal to `LOG_INPUT_SIZE` characters, it will not be null-terminated. If the `filename` is shorter than `LOG_INPUT_SIZE` characters but not null-terminated, or if the `length` parameter is greater than `LOG_INPUT_SIZE`, this will also result in a buffer overflow. This can lead to undefined behavior, especially when the `saveToLogFile` function is called with the `buf` as an argument.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the buffer is always null-terminated. This can be done by using the `snprintf` function instead of `strncpy`:

Replace the line:
```c
strncpy(buf, filename, length);
```
With:
```c
snprintf(buf, LOG_INPUT_SIZE, "%s", filename);
```
or
```c
strncpy(buf, filename, LOG_INPUT_SIZE - 1);
buf[LOG_INPUT_SIZE - 1] = '\0';
```
This will guarantee null-termination of the string in `buf`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define LOG_INPUT_SIZE 40
                     
// saves the file name to a log file
int outputFilenameToLog(char *filename, int length) {
    int success;
        
    // buffer with size set to maximum size for input to log file
    char buf[LOG_INPUT_SIZE];
        
    // copy filename to buffer
    strncpy(buf, filename, length);
        
    // save to log file
    success = saveToLogFile(buf);
    return success;
}
```
