VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The method 'doExchange' has a broad exception declaration, which may indicate that it does not have adequate error handling and exception management.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the doExchange method throws three different types of exceptions: IOException, InvocationTargetException, and SQLException. This suggests that the method may be doing multiple things and is not properly encapsulated, leading to over-broad exception declaration. A more robust approach would be to handle specific exceptions as close to the source as possible and re-throw only the exceptions that are most relevant to the method. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid catching or throwing general exceptions as they can make debugging and logging more challenging.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To improve the design and exception handling of the doExchange method, it's recommended to:
- Catch specific exceptions closer to their source, rather than letting them propagate up to this method.
- Create abstract exceptions that better describe the conditions that may occur within the method.
- Throw these abstract exceptions up to higher levels in the code where they can be logged and potentially re-thrown.
- Ensure that all checked exceptions are properly logged and re-thrown. 

This might involve changing the method signature to:
- public void doExchange() throws ExchangeException {...}
and introducing the following wrapper exception class:
- public class ExchangeException extends IOException
More specific handling would replace the InvocationTargetException and potentially rethrow a meaningful exception for that specific condition.
- InvocationTargetException would require refactoring or a separate handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public void doExchange() throws IOException, InvocationTargetException, SQLException {...}
