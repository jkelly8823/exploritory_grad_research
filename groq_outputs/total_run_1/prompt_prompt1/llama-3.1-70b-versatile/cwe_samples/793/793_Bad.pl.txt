VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack, allowing an attacker to access and read files outside of the intended directory.

EXPLANATION:
The code reads an untrusted input with the function `GetUntrustedInput()` and assigns it to the variable `$Username`. The code then attempts to sanitize the input by removing any occurrences of "../" with a regex replacement. However, this sanitization is not sufficient to prevent a Directory Traversal attack. An attacker can still manipulate the input to navigate to other directories by using encoded or encoded Unicode characters, or by entering malicious directory names. The sanitized input is then concatenated with a hardcoded directory path (`"/home/user/"`) to form the filename, and the `ReadAndSendFile()` function is called with this filename. If an attacker can successfully navigate to a sensitive file, they can cause the `ReadAndSendFile()` function to read and send the contents of that file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a more robust method of sanitizing the untrusted input. Here are a few recommendations:

- Use a library that provides a function to safely and securely handle directory traversals, such as `URI` or `Cwd` in Perl.
- Instead of concatenating the input to a hardcoded directory path, use a method like `Cwd::realpath()` to verify that the input does not navigate outside of the intended directory.
- Consider using a whitelist approach to validate the input, allowing only known and trusted inputs to access files.
- Always validate and sanitize any untrusted input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
