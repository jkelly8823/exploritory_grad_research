VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Audit logging is enabled but set to minimal levels. The 'serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel' and 'messageAuthenticationAuditLevel' are set to 'None', which means that major security events are not being monitored.

EXPLANATION:
Although audit logging is enabled, the audit level is set to minimal, which means that potential security events are not being tracked. The 'serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel' and 'messageAuthenticationAuditLevel' settings in the config are set to 'None', which indicate that no audit record will be generated for authorization and authentication events. In a normal scenario, these levels should be set to 'Success' or 'Failure', depending on the requirement. This setting can lead to attackers successfully exploiting the system without leaving any audit trails.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Include the following setting in the serviceSecurityAudit configuration to ensure critical security events are being logged:
- serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel: This should be set to at least "Success" to track and record any successful authorization events. 
- messageAuthenticationAuditLevel: This should be set to at least "Success" to track and record any successful authentication events. 

Here is a code snippet that should be used instead:
```xml
<system.serviceModel>
  <behaviors>
    <serviceBehaviors>
      <behavior name="NewBehavior">
        <serviceSecurityAudit 
          auditLogLocation="Default" 
          suppressAuditFailure="false"
          serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel="Success"
          messageAuthenticationAuditLevel="Success" />
        ...
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

      <behavior name="NewBehavior">
        <serviceSecurityAudit

          suppressAuditFailure="false"
          serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel="None"
          messageAuthenticationAuditLevel="None" />
        ...
