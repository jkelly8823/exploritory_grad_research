VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3/NA is not relevant here (note we will say 3 even though there are less distinct lines given the instructions and the fact there is more than one command on the first line for line numbering)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to hard-coded credential exposure. 

EXPLANATION:
The given code includes sensitive information, specifically the `--account-name` and `--account-key`, which are likely placeholders for a real Azure storage account and its corresponding access key. These values should be considered sensitive information and should never be hardcoded or exposed in plain text. 

Hardcoding credentials in scripts or tools poses significant security risks because they are easily accessible to anyone having access to the code. These keys could potentially be used by unauthorized users to manipulate or gain access to Azure resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the `--account-name` and `--account-key` directly, consider using the following alternatives:
- Define environment variables to hold these sensitive values. These can be set at runtime.
- Use a secure secrets management system to retrieve and use these credentials in a secure manner.
- If using Azure CLI, leverage the default credential methods to generate tokens based on Service Principals (SPNs) or Environment Variables
