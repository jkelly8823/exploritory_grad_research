VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (command-line input)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Exposure of sensitive information through hard-coded credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The command-line input includes the --account-key parameter, which suggests that an Azure storage account key is being passed directly within the command. This practice poses a significant security risk as it exposes the account key, making it accessible to unauthorized individuals who may have access to the command history or execution logs. Hard-coding sensitive information directly in commands is considered a security vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication**: Instead of using account keys, configure Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication for your Azure storage accounts. This approach provides more secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

2.  **Use Azure Key Vault**: Store your Azure storage account keys securely in Azure Key Vault, which provides a centralized secret management solution. Use Azure Key Vault to securely retrieve and inject the account key into your scripts or commands.

3.  **Use environment variables or secure input mechanisms**: If using account keys is unavoidable, consider passing them as environment variables or using secure input mechanisms that do not expose the key directly. For example, you can use AZ CLI's --account-key parameter with a value retrieved from a secure source, like Azure Key Vault or an environment variable.
