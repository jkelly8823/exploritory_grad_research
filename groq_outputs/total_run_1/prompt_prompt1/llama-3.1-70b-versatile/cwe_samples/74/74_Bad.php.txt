VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to an OS Command Injection attack. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

EXPLANATION:
The code is using user input (`$_POST["user"]`) directly in the construction of a system command. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that can be executed by the system function. The `system` function executes the command with the privileges of the web server, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or even a full system compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate and sanitize the user input before using it in a system command. A possible solution is to use a whitelist of allowed users and check if the input matches one of them. Additionally, the use of prepared statements or parameterized commands is also recommended. However, in this case, using a command like `ls` can be avoided altogether. 

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to fix the vulnerability:

```php
$allowedUsers = array('user1', 'user2', 'user3');
$userName = $_POST["user"];

if(in_array($userName, $allowedUsers)) {
    $directory = '/home/'.$userName;
    $files = scandir($directory);
    foreach ($files as $file) {
        print($file."\n");
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you must use the `system` function, consider using `escapeshellarg` to escape the input:

```php
$COMMAND = 'ls -l /home/';
$escUserName = escapeshellarg($_POST["user"]);
$command = $COMMAND.$escUserName;
system($command);
```

However, be aware that even with `escapeshellarg` the `system` function is still a security risk if not used carefully.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$userName = $_POST["user"];$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;system($command);
```
