VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the regular expression ` /^\w[\w\-]+$/`. The regular expression makes use of the `\w` special sequence which matches alphanumeric characters, including the underscore, and `\w-` matches an alphanumeric character or an underscore followed by an optional hyphen. This could be exploited to cause a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack, which may result in significant performance degradation or even a crash. An attacker may send an input string that contains a large number of repeating sequence patterns that this regular expression needs to handle (for example, "aaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaa-...").

The cause of this vulnerability is due to backtracking issues in the regular expression. Specifically, backtracking can cause catastrophic backtracking which leads to significant slowdowns in the evaluation of the regular expression.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent ReDoS attacks, we can use possessive quantifiers in the regular expression to prevent backtracking. Unfortunately, Perl 5 does not fully support this syntax. However, we can prevent backtracking issues using atomic groups along with anchors:

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) 
```

RECOMMENDED CODE:
```
if ($name =~ /^(?>\w+[\w\-]*-?$)/)
```
This prevents backtracking and significantly improves performance for malicious inputs that caused ReDoS issues in the original code.
