VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the way the `$fname` variable is used to construct the `$cmd` string in the `do_listing` subroutine. Although the `validate_name` subroutine checks if the name is well-formed, it only checks for the presence of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. However, this validation is not sufficient to prevent command injection.

An attacker could inject malicious shell commands by including shell metacharacters, such as semicolons or parentheses, that are not caught by the validation. For example, if the attacker passes the string "example.txt;rm -rf *" as the filename, the command "rm -rf *" would be executed, potentially deleting files and causing harm.

The `validate_name` subroutine only checks for the format of the input, but does not prevent the injection of malicious commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use Perl's `quotemeta` function to escape any special characters in the `$fname` variable before constructing the command string. Alternatively, you can use Perl's `system` function with a list of arguments instead of a single string, which can prevent command injection.

Here is an example of how you can fix the code:

```perl
sub do_listing {
  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {
    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;
  }
  # build command
  # Use quotemeta to escape special characters
  my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l " . quotemeta($fname);
  system($cmd);
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `system` function with a list of arguments:

```perl
sub do_listing {
  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {
    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;
  }
  # build command
  # Use a list of arguments to prevent command injection
  system("/bin/ls", "-l", $fname);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```perl
my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
do_listing($arg);

sub do_listing {
  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {
    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;
  }
  # build command
  my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
  system($cmd);
}

sub validate_name {
  my($name) = @_;
  if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {
    return(1);
  }
  else {
    return(0);
  }
}
```
