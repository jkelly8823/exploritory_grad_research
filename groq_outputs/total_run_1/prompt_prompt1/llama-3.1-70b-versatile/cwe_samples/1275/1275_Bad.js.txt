Insecure Cookie Configuration: Missing HttpOnly and Secure Flags

EXPLANATION:
The examined code snippet is setting a session ID as a cookie. However, it does not include the HttpOnly and Secure flags, which are essential security measures to prevent certain types of attacks. The HttpOnly flag protects cookies from being accessed by client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript), thereby preventing XSS attacks. The Secure flag ensures that cookies are transmitted over a secure protocol (HTTPS), preventing cookie tampering.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to include the HttpOnly and Secure flags when setting the cookie:

```javascript
let sessionId = generateSessionId()
let cookieOptions = { 
  domain: 'example.com', 
  httpOnly: true, 
  secure: true 
}
response.cookie('sessionid', sessionId, cookieOptions)
```

Additionally, consider setting a reasonable expiration time for the cookie using the `maxAge` option or the `expires` option:

```javascript
let cookieOptions = { 
  domain: 'example.com', 
  httpOnly: true, 
  secure: true, 
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days 
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
let sessionId = generateSessionId()
let cookieOptions = { domain: 'example.com' }
response.cookie('sessionid', sessionId, cookieOptions)
```
