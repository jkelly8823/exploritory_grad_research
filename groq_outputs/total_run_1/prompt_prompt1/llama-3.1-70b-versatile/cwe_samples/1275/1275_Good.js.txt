VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to insecure cookie flags leading to Session Fixation attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `Strict` value for the `sameSite` attribute. The `sameSite` attribute with a value of `Lax` or `Strict` prevents cookies from being sent in cross-site requests, which can help prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. However, this attribute does not add any protection against Session Fixation attacks. In order to prevent session fixation, the `httpOnly` and `secure` flags should also be set to `true`, ensuring the cookie cannot be accessed or modified by the client and can only be transmitted over a secure (HTTPS) connection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Set the `httpOnly` and `secure` flags to `true` to prevent session fixation attacks.

The updated code should look like this:
```
let sessionId = generateSessionId()
let cookieOptions = { 
  domain: 'example.com', 
  sameSite: 'Strict', 
  httpOnly: true, 
  secure: true 
}
response.cookie('sessionid', sessionId, cookieOptions)
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```
let sessionId = generateSessionId()
let cookieOptions = { domain: 'example.com', sameSite: 'Strict' }
response.cookie('sessionid', sessionId, cookieOptions)
```
