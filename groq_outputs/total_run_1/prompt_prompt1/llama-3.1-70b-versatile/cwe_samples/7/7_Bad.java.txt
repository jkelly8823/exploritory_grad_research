VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());}
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Logging of Sensitive Data (Information Disclosure)

EXPLANATION:
In this code, there is a potential vulnerability in the way an exception is being handled. When an ApplicationSpecificException occurs, the error message is logged along with the string representation of the exception. The problem with this approach is that it can inadvertently log sensitive information that might be present in the exception message, such as database connection details, user credentials, or other security-sensitive data.

This is because calling toString() on an exception can potentially reveal internal state of the program, including details about the system environment, and other context-specific information. If an attacker is able to induce an exception and view the resulting log, they may be able to gather information about the system's inner workings that would aid in future attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of logging the entire exception, only log the meaningful part of the exception, such as its message, which has been sanitized of any potentially sensitive data.
- Alternatively, consider logging only the fact that an exception occurred without recording its message.

Here's an example of how this might be written:

```java
catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
    logger.error("An exception of type {} occurred", ase.getClass().getSimpleName());
    if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
        logger.debug("Original exception was: {}", ase.getMessage());
    }
}
```
This way, if an exception occurs, we're logging the fact that an exception occurred without including the details by default. We still have the option to switch on debugging to capture and inspect exception messages more closely in a controlled testing or staging environment.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());}}
```
