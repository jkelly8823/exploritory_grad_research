VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A hardcoded database password is present in the provided code, posing a security risk in case of unauthorized access to the codebase.

EXPLANATION:
The database password is hardcoded in plain text within the code. In the event of unauthorized access to the codebase or a data breach, this information could be exposed. Furthermore, since the password is not encrypted, it can be read and exploited by anyone with access to the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

*   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code.
*   Utilize environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive data, such as database credentials.
*   If environment variables are not feasible, use a secrets management tool to securely store and manage sensitive data.
*   When storing sensitive data, use encryption to protect the information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php$dbName = 'usersDB';$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';?>
```
