VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Inheritance of Apache Struts ActionForm Class

EXPLANATION:
The code provided inherits from the Apache Struts ActionForm class, which has known vulnerabilities. The Apache Struts Framework has numerous security bulletins and advisories due to its legacy architecture. Using this class directly in modern application development poses security risks, especially if the version of Struts is outdated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Migrate to a modern Java-based web framework, such as Spring or JavaServer Faces (JSF), that provides more robust security features and support for newer technologies. Consider rewriting the RegistrationForm class to follow best practices and avoid direct inheritance of potentially vulnerable classes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class RegistrationForm extends org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm {
    // private variables for registration formprivate String name;private String email;...
    public RegistrationForm() {super();}
    // getter and setter methods for private variables...
}
```
