VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Redirect Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses JavaScript to redirect the user to an external website by setting the 'href' attribute of an 'a' tag to an attacker-controlled URL. The URL 'http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html' is hardcoded and may lead users to malicious websites, potentially allowing an attacker to conduct phishing attacks. 
Although this example appears to be innocuous at first glance, the vulnerability typically arises when the server redirects the user to a URL specified by a parameter in the request or by an external source without proper validation. Here, we assume this URL is hardcoded but was initially derived from an attacker-controlled source.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this type of vulnerability, URLs should be carefully validated to ensure they only point to trustworthy and expected domains. Using a whitelist of known safe URLs or domains and properly encoding all URLs is recommended. Use of protocol-relative URLs or relative URLs can also help minimize the risk.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">

However, since the issue at hand appears to involve hardcoded and thus non-hostile content, the result leans more towards 'no vulnerability.' Still, for the sake of the demonstration, here are safer alternatives.


Following safer pattern 

A more general  example avoiding URL redirection:
<a href="/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
  
A more specific pattern providing an example utilizing protocol relative URLs in external app:
<a href="//example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
