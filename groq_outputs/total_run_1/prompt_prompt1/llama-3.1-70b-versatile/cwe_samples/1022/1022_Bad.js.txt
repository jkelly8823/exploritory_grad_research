VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Unvalidated Redirect vulnerabilities due to the use of an untrusted URL with the window.open method.

EXPLANATION:
The window.open method is used to create a new browser window or tab and specify a URL to be opened. However, if the URL is not validated or sanitized, it can be exploited by attackers to load malicious content, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Unvalidated Redirect vulnerabilities. The provided URL appears to be controlled by an attacker, which can be used to inject malicious code or redirect the user to an attacker-controlled site.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, recommend using a validated and sanitized URL or a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded. It's also recommended to use a relative URL or a trusted URL instead of an absolute URL.

Here is an example of a recommended fix:
```javascript
const newWindow = window.open('/useful-page.html', '_blank');
```
Alternatively, if you need to open an external link, you can validate and sanitize the URL using a trusted library or by checking if the URL starts with a trusted domain:
```javascript
const trustedDomain = 'example.com';
const url = 'http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html';

if (url.startsWith(`http://${trustedDomain}`)) {
  const newWindow = window.open(url, '_blank');
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
```
