VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a self-XSS attack via the window.opener property.
 
EXPLANATION:
The code sets the `window.opener` property to `null` for a newly opened window, with the intention of mitigating certain types of attacks. However, in modern browsers, this will actually expose the new window's location to the original opener window, allowing the original window to control the new window via cross-site scripting (XSS). By setting `window.opener = null`, the new window loses protection from the original window's scripts and becomes vulnerable to XSS attacks from the opener page. 

This is because when `window.opener` is `null`, the new window can no longer block the original opener from being able to determine its location through `opener.closed` property changes, thereby making it vulnerable to attacks like stealing user data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
When opening a new window via the `window.open()` method, do not set `window.opener` to `null`. Instead, use the `noopener` or `noreferrer` attribute to specify how the new window should be opened. The `noopener` attribute tells the browser that the new window should not have access to the original window, preventing potential XSS attacks. Similarly, `noreferrer` serves a related but distinct security purpose by preventing the referring site's identification through HTTP headers.

Here's an example of using `noopener` attribute when creating the anchor tag in HTML:
```html
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit page</a>
```
When using JavaScript to open a new window, use the following code instead:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank", 'noopener=yes');
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");newWindow.opener = null;
```
