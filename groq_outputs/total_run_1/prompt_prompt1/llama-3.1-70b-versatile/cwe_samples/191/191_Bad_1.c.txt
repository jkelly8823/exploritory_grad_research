VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Variable Length Array (VLA) overflows and lack of bounds checking.

EXPLANATION:
The code creates a variable length array `buf` with size `len`, which is calculated as `a - b`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 6, `len` will be -1. In C, the size of an array must be positive, and negative sizes are undefined behavior. In this case, the compiler may choose to allocate memory with a very large size, effectively overflowing the stack. This can lead to memory corruption, segmentation faults, and even arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should check the size of the array before allocating memory. We should also ensure that the array size is not negative. Here's an example of how to fix this:

```c
int a = 5, b = 6;
size_t len = abs(a - b);  // Use the absolute value to avoid negative sizes
if (len < SOME_REASONABLE_UPPER_BOUND) {
    char buf[len];
    // ...
} else {
    // Handle the error case
}
```

Note that the above code uses `abs` from `stdlib.h` to calculate the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. This ensures that `len` is always non-negative. Additionally, we've added a bounds check to prevent allocating excessively large arrays.

ORIGINAL CODE:


		    int a = 5, b = 6;
		    size_t len = a - b;
		    char buf[len];    // Just blows up the stack
		   }
