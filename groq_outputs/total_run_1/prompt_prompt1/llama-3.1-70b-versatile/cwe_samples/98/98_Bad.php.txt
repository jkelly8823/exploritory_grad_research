VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises from the fact that the code directly includes a file based on user input from the `$_GET['module_name']` superglobal without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially include any file on the system, both locally and remotely, by manipulating the `module_name` query parameter. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, remote code execution, or even a complete takeover of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the user input: Always validate and sanitize user input data, especially when it's used to include files or execute system commands.
2. Use a whitelist: Instead of directly including the file based on user input, maintain a whitelist of allowed files and check if the input matches any of the allowed files.
3. Avoid using `$_GET` or other superglobals for file inclusions: Consider using a more secure method for passing parameters, such as using a POST request or a token-based system.
4. Consider using a router or a dispatcher: Instead of including files manually, consider using a router or a dispatcher to handle the logic of loading controllers or executing actions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$dir = $_GET['module_name'];include($dir . "/function.php");
