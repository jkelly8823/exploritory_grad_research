VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be written in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) and is used for specifying the architecture and design of digital circuits. The lines of code define two parameters: `MEM_SIZE` and `JTAG_OFFSET`. There are no obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, pointer arithmetic, or unchecked input values, that could be used to exploit the code. Since there is no apparent executable code or user input handling, there are no potential vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary, as this code snippet appears to be secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
					parameter  MEM_SIZE = 100;
					localparam JTAG_OFFSET = 100;
