VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access due to integer underflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, there is an array access using the variable `JTAG_OFFSET` which is defined as 81. However, when accessing the `mem` array, it uses `JTAG_OFFSET-1` as the index. Since `JTAG_OFFSET` is defined as 81, this could potentially result in accessing memory out of bounds.

Another vulnerability present here is in the lines where it is assigning multiple mem arrays. Here, during the concatenation process if `JTAG_OFFSET` is 0 and if `mem` is being accessed as `mem[JTAG_OFFSET-1]`, it can lead to undefined behavior or integer underflow which will then access `mem[-1]` resulting in underflow and thus lead to unpredictable results or unexpected outcome.

In other lines, given below:

`mem[JTAG_OFFSET-2], mem[JTAG_OFFSET-3], mem[JTAG_OFFSET-4], mem[JTAG_OFFSET-5], mem[JTAG_OFFSET-6], mem[JTAG_OFFSET-7], mem[JTAG_OFFSET-8]`

the same might occur.

In SystemVerilog, because indexing is 0-based and because some array types could allow negative indexing, shifting above arrays could be done with the risk of an out-of-bounds error that could potentially lead to a memory leak or buffer overflow on most compilers given these constraints of shift or subtraction operations turning either towards right hand side (higher values in array), or left (negative indexing).


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add error checking to make sure that the `JTAG_OFFSET` index value does not underflow, i.e., result in a negative value. Adjust or add if needed any 'offset mechanism you would be using in order to avoid array indexing in the form above.

To fix the integer underflow vulnerability you can add a bounds check before accessing the array. Here is an example:

```
wire [31:0] jtag_value;
integer i;

for( i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1 ) begin
    if( JTAG_OFFSET - i < 0) begin
        // deal with underflow: perhaps jtag_value should be some signal, or maybe undefined behaviour results and end/stop test
        // assign jtag_value with some sensible signal or set it with a reset, such that any further action could easily be avoided    
    end else begin
        jtag_value = jtag_value +{mem[JTAG_OFFSET - i]};
    end    
end
assign jtag_hash_o = jtag_value;
```

Another alternative solution: Since all of those indices have offsets reduced from the shift at value equals 81 at index and offset for values all occur subtracted away till -one prior of underflows, perhaps offset shift may better define new rule JtagShiftValue=  (MemSize - 1)  
Assign JtagShiftValue To an integer

and later 
change the jtagHash line

to a more 
robust formulation 

when new variable defined this is how to shift 
these indexes correctly  since all begin from this new value.

Alternatively use method bounds prior all indexes shifted values 0 upwards.
