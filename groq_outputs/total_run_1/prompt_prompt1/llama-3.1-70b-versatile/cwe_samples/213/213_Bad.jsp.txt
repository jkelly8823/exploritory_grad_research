VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to a sensitive data exposure vulnerability. It appears to be displaying sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers (SSN) and Credit Card Numbers (CCN) directly in the application's output, potentially allowing unauthorized access to this sensitive data.

EXPLANATION:
By directly outputting sensitive data like SSNs and CCNs, the application risks compromising the confidentiality of its users' information. This could happen if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the application's output or intercepts the data as it's being transmitted. It's essential to implement proper data masking, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Mask sensitive data: Instead of displaying the full SSN or CCN, consider masking all but the last few digits to protect the user's sensitive information.
2. Use encryption: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted before storing or transmitting it. This could involve using HTTPS for data transmission and secure encryption algorithms like AES for data storage.
3. Implement access controls: Limit access to sensitive data to authorized personnel only. Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to enforce strict access controls.
4. Review data handling practices: Assess the application's data handling practices to identify potential security weaknesses and implement necessary security controls to prevent data breaches.
