VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Potential Server-side Request Forgery (SRF) or Code Injection Vulnerability due to unsanitized and untrusted input 'depends' attribute.

EXPLANATION:
 The vulnerability arises because the 'depends' attribute could be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious code or perform server-side requests. This could potentially lead to remote code execution or server-side request forgery. Although no explicit user input can be seen here, this attribute may be populated using an unsanitized user input source elsewhere, leading to a potential vulnerability. If the 'depends' attribute is supposed to be populated only by a predefined list of trusted values, a proper validation against these values should be performed. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the 'depends' attribute against a predefined list of trusted values before populating it. 
2. Use a whitelisting approach to restrict 'depends' attribute to specific allowed values.
3. In the code snippet where 'depends' attribute is populated, use a secure way to retrieve values, such as by fetching them from a database or through a validated source.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <form name="DateRangeForm"><field property="startDate" depends="date"><arg0 key="start.date"/></field><field property="endDate" depends="date"><arg0 key="end.date"/></field><field property="scale" depends="integer"><arg0 key="range.scale"/></field></form>
