VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Potential Unvalidated Input Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided Java code snippet appears to be a simple form class that holds a start and end date. However, the `startDate` and `endDate` fields are directly settable from the `setStartDate` and `setEndDate` methods, respectively, without any validation or checks. This poses two potential security issues: (1) IDOR, where an attacker may be able to manipulate the date ranges that should be restricted, and (2) Potential Unvalidated Input, where the class does not verify the format or validity of the input dates, which could potentially lead to further attacks or unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input dates: Add checks in the `setStartDate` and `setEndDate` methods to ensure the dates are in the correct format and fall within the expected range. This can be achieved using `SimpleDateFormat` or `java.time` libraries.
2. Implement secure date manipulation: Use secure date manipulation classes, such as `LocalDate` from `java.time` package, which provides safer date operations and avoids the possibility of date tampering.
3. Perform input validation: Use a date pattern validation to restrict possible values and ensure they align with the expected format.
4. Restrict accessibility: Consider reducing the accessibility of the `startDate` and `endDate` fields by making them private or reducing the scope of the setter methods (e.g., by making them private or package-private).
5. Use Beans Validation: Use Beans Validation 2.0 to apply annotations such as `@NotNull` and `@Pattern` to enforce stricter controls over date input data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class DateRangeForm extends ValidatorForm {
    String startDate, endDate;

    public void setStartDate(String startDate) {
        this.startDate = startDate;
    }

    public void setEndDate(String endDate) {
        this.endDate = endDate;
    }
}
```
