VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (indicates entire segment)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a hardcoded database password, which can allow unauthorized access to the database if the configuration file falls into the wrong hands.

EXPLANATION:
Hardcoding database passwords is a significant security risk because it makes it possible for an attacker to obtain the credentials and gain access to the database. This can lead to data breaches, data tampering, and even system compromise. The password 'password' is also extremely weak and does not comply with any security standards.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, you can use one of the following methods:
1. **Encrypt the connection string:** Store the connection string in an encrypted form and decrypt it when needed. This can be achieved using the Protection of Data Using Protected Configuration feature in .NET.
2. **Use environment variables or a separate configuration file:** Instead of hardcoding the database password, store it as an environment variable or in a separate configuration file that is not easily accessible.
3. **Use a password management service:** Implement a password management service to securely store and retrieve database credentials.
4. **Use a stronger password:** Ensure that the password is stronger and complies with your organization's password policy.
