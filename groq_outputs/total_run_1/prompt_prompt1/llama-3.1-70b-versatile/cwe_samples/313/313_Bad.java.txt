VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive information

EXPLANATION:
The code contains hardcoded sensitive information (secret username and password) in a ResourceBundle properties file. This practice is insecure and poses a significant risk of exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

Hardcoding sensitive information makes it difficult to manage and update credentials, and it can also lead to insider threats. If an attacker gains access to the code or the properties file, they can easily read the sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following best practices:

1.  **Use environment variables or configuration files**: Store sensitive information in environment variables or configuration files that are not version-controlled or accessible to unauthorized parties.
2.  **Implement a secure secrets management system**: Use a secure secrets management system to store and manage sensitive information. These systems provide features such as encryption, access controls, and auditing.
3.  **Use placeholder values in code**: In the code, use placeholder values for sensitive information, and have the actual values injected from external sources during deployment or execution.

ORIGINAL CODE:

# Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
