VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling

EXPLANATION:
The code catches an IOException, but the response sent to the user only indicates a "404 Not Found" error (SC_NOT_FOUND), which is not relevant to the error that occurred. This can potentially hide the true nature of the exception and help an attacker to discover the actual exception type and root cause. This can be particularly problematic in cases where the exception contains sensitive information, which an attacker might exploit to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious actions. A generic or informative error message should be used instead of hiding the actual cause of the exception.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of sending a generic "404 Not Found" error message when an IOException occurs, consider logging the exception for analysis and debugging purposes. Then, send a generic but informative error message to the user. This way, you will maintain error handling transparency without providing sensitive information that could help potential attackers.

Additionally, do not simply re-throw or propagate the exception without proper logging, as this can help an attacker gain valuable information about your system.

Here's a more secure approach:

```java
try {
    // code that might throw IOException
} catch (IOException ioe) {
    logger.error(ioe.getMessage(), ioe);  // Log the exception for analysis
    response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "An internal error occurred");  
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
try {
    // something that might throw IOException
    ...
} catch (IOException ioe) {
    response.sendError(SC_NOT_FOUND);
}
```
