VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (Multiple lines are vulnerable)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to insecure encryption protocol, using a weak key size, and using a hardcoded initialization vector (IV).

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is using the DES (Data Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm, which is insecure and outdated. It uses a weak key size of 56 bits, which can be easily brute-forced by modern computers. Additionally, the code is using a hardcoded IV, which can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data. The code is also missing the input bytes to be encrypted, which is passed as `inpBytes` but not defined anywhere.

Furthermore, the code is using a fixed block cipher mode (CBC) with PKCS#5 padding, which can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks if the cipher is not implemented correctly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade the encryption algorithm to a secure one, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
2. Use a secure key size, such as 128, 192, or 256 bits.
3. Generate a unique IV for each encryption operation using a secure random number generator.
4. Define the input bytes to be encrypted and ensure that they are properly validated and sanitized before encryption.
5. Use authenticated encryption (AE) modes, such as GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) or CCM (Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code), which provide both confidentiality and authenticity.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public class SymmetricCipherTest {
    public static void main() {
        byte[] text = "Secret".getBytes();
        byte[] iv = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
        KeyGenerator kg = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");
        kg.init(56);
        SecretKey key = kg.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        IvParameterSpec ips = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ips);
        return cipher.doFinal(inpBytes);
    }
}
```

Note: As the code snippet is incomplete and doesn't compile without `inpBytes`, the vulnerabilities were identified based on the overall structure of the code.
