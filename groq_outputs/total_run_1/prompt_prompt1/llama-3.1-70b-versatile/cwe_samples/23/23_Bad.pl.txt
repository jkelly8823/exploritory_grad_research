VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to Path Traversal and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, as well as Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable because it directly concatenates user input (`my $username = param("user")`) to construct a file path. This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate the path to access arbitrary files on the system, including sensitive data. Additionally, the code does not validate or sanitize the user input, which further exacerbates the vulnerability.

Furthermore, the code uses the `print` statement to directly output the file contents, which can lead to further security issues if the file contains malicious data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to a specific format and does not contain malicious data. Use a whitelist approach to only allow authorized characters.
2. Use a secure method to construct the file path, such as using a template or a parameterized function that takes the user input as a parameter.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging to detect and prevent potential security issues.
4. Use a more secure method to output the file contents, such as using a templating engine or escaping the data to prevent XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles"; my $username = param("user"); my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath"); print "<ul>\n"; while (<$fh>) { print "<li>$_</li>\n"; } print "</ul>\n";
```
