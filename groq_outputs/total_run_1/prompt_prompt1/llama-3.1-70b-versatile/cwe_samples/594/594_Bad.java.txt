VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability due to missing `@Column` annotation for sensitive fields and potential lack of access controls for sensitive fields.

EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the code, it is noticed that the ID field is annotated as `@Id` but no `@Column` annotation is present. Additionally, the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `address` fields are not annotated with `@Column` either. This might not necessarily be a vulnerability by itself, but it could lead to an IDOR vulnerability if the application does not have proper access controls for its database operations.

Moreover, it's a good practice to include the `@Column` annotation for all the database columns, including the `@Id` field. This annotation provides additional configuration such as specifying the column name and its data type.

Another concern is the `Customer` class does not follow Java naming conventions, that is it does not have a field corresponding to `id`. It has `getCustomerId` method for which there is no corresponding `id` field. This could be confusing.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Ensure that proper access controls are implemented at all levels to prevent sensitive data exposure. This can include, but is not limited to, the database, the application, and the API.
2.  Include `@Column` annotations for all database fields. This will help clarify the relationship between the Java class fields and database columns.
3.  Rename the methods `getCustomerId`, `setCustomerId` to `getId` and `setId`, to match with `id` field in `customer` class.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
    private String id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Address address;

    public Customer() {}
    public Customer(String id, String firstName, String lastName) {...}

    @Id
    @Column(name = "customer_id")
    public String getId() {...}

    public void setId(String id) {...}

    @Column(name = "first_name")
    public String getFirstName() {...}

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {...}

    @Column(name = "last_name")
    public String getLastName() {...}

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {...}

    @OneToOne
    public Address getAddress() {...}

    public void setAddress(Address address) {...}
}
```
