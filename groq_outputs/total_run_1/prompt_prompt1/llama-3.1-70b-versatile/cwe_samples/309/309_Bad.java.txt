VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The code uses SHA for password hashing, which is insecure. Moreover, the code uses the `String` constructor to create a new string from the `plainTextIn` array, and then stores it in the `plainText` variable but never uses it. The code then proceeds to update the digest with the `plainTextIn` instead of the `plainText` variable.

EXPLANATION: SHA is a cryptographic hash function, not a password hashing algorithm. Password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive to make brute-force attacks unfeasible. SHA, on the other hand, is designed to be fast and can be easily broken using brute-force attacks. Additionally, using the `String` constructor to create a new string from the `plainTextIn` array and then not using the new string can introduce timing attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Use a secure password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks unfeasible.
- Use a more secure way to compare byte arrays, such as `java.util.Arrays.equals()` or `java.util.Arrays.compare()`.
- Update the digest with the correct input, or remove the unnecessary code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
```
