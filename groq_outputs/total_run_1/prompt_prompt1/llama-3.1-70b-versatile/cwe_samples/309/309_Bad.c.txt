VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses SHA-1 hash for password comparison and stores the hashed password. SHA-1 is considered insecure for password hashing due to its vulnerability to collision attacks and pre-image attacks. Additionally, the comparison of hashes using a simple equality check is vulnerable to timing attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The use of SHA-1 for password hashing is insecure because it can be reversed by generating the hash of a large number of common passwords and comparing them to the stored hash. Additionally, the code's comparison of the hashed password and the 'ctext' is done using the 'equal' function, which may be vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker can use this information to determine if the hash matches or not by measuring the time difference.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, Argon2 or PBKDF2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more secure against brute-force attacks.
2. Use a secure comparison function, such as a constant-time comparison function, to compare the hashed password and the input hash. This can help prevent timing attacks.
3. Use a salt value when hashing passwords to prevent pre-computed table attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
        login_user();
    }
}
```

Note: The exact fix for this code is dependent on the language and the specific implementation of the 'simple_digest' and 'equal' functions. However, the recommendations provided above should be followed in general to improve the security of password hashing and comparison.
