VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dangling pointer casting.

EXPLANATION:
The issue with this code lies in the assignment and casting of the memory allocation result. The code is casting the result of `malloc` to `(double *)`, which may hide an error. 

In C++, if `malloc` fails, it returns `NULL`, which is not cast to a specific type. If `NULL` is then assigned to a typed pointer, the compiler may not generate an error. However, when this code is compiled with C's `malloc`, it hides the NULL return. This will not prevent a compile-time error, but it will prevent a runtime error.

However, this is not the end of the error, the main issue in this line really deals with the actual memory size, sizeof(foo) gets the size of a memory address (which is usually 8 bytes). But foo is declared as double pointer, thus you were supposed to have been allocating memory like this- foo = (double *)malloc(num * sizeof(double));

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The casting should be avoided to allow the compiler to report a missing library inclusion or a type mismatch. Additionally, `sizeof` should be used with the actual type and not the pointer. 

A possible fix for this can look like this:
```c
double *foo;
int num = ...;
foo = malloc(num * sizeof(double));
if (foo == NULL) {
    // Handle memory allocation error here
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
double *foo;
...foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(foo));
```
