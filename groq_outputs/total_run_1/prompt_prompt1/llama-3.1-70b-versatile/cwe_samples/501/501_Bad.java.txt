VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to potential session fixation attacks and authenticated input attacks by directly setting the value of the session attribute to untrusted data from the request parameter.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes the 'usrname' from the request parameter and sets it as the value of the session attribute 'ATTR_USR' without any validation or sanitization. This is potentially insecure because it allows an attacker to forge a cookie that can impersonate another user.

Moreover, session fixation attacks can occur when an attacker can influence the value of a session ID that is later used by an application as its session ID. In this case, an attacker could potentially set their own username and make it available for later use.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation and sanitization for untrusted user input data to prevent authenticated input attacks.
2. To prevent session fixation attacks, regenerate the session ID immediately after the user logs in, and ensure that sensitive information is only stored on the server-side.
3. Set the HTTPOnly flag for session cookies to prevent JavaScript from accessing the session ID.

ORIGINAL CODE:
usrname = request.getParameter("usrname");
if (session.getAttribute(ATTR_USR) == null) {session.setAttribute(ATTR_USR, usrname);}
