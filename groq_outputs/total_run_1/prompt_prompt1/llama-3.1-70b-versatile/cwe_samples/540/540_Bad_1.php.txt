VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 SQL Injection and possible file inclusion vulnerability through the 'database.inc' file, coupled with the inclusion of user-input data ($username, $password) directly into the database authentication without proper sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The given PHP code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks and also might be susceptible to file inclusion vulnerability. The inclusion of 'database.inc' could potentially lead to problems if the file path to the 'database.inc' file isn't handled correctly. The most pressing issue is that the $username and $password variables seem to be coming from an untrusted user source. In a typical web application, these would be coming from user input and can be manipulated by an attacker. Without proper validation and sanitization, these inputs can lead to an attacker being able to inject and execute arbitrary SQL code, giving access to the entire database.

Furthermore, the $dbName and $dbPassword variables seem to be used without proper validation as well, if these are hardcoded, it presents an issue as they could be exposed if an attacker were to somehow view the code of this script.

The concatenation and use of untrusted data in a database query string could allow for an SQL injection vulnerability that might be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the database. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Ensure that $dbName and $dbPassword are securely stored, such as in environment variables, or other secure key management systems.
- Validate and sanitize user inputs, $username and $password, before passing them to the database query string. Ideally, prepared statements should be used to segregate code and user input data.
- Use parameterized queries when interacting with the database to prevent malicious SQL injection attacks.
- Secure the database connection and authentication details.
- Validate the file path of the included 'database.inc' to prevent local file inclusion attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
include('database.inc');
$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);
$db.authenticateUser($username, $password);
?>
```
