VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains hardcoded database credentials, including the database name and password. This is a security vulnerability because if an attacker gains access to the code, they can easily obtain the credentials and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. Hardcoding sensitive information can make it difficult to manage and update credentials, and it increases the risk of exposing sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, database credentials should be stored in a secure environment variable or a configuration file that is not accessible to the public. This way, even if an attacker gains access to the code, they will not be able to obtain the credentials.

Here is an example of how to store credentials in environment variables:

```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```

Alternatively, you can store credentials in a secure configuration file, such as `.env`:

```makefile
DB_NAME=usersDB
DB_PASSWORD=skjdh#67nkjd3$3$
```

Then, you can load the credentials in your code:

```php
$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();
$dbName = $_ENV['DB_NAME'];
$dbPassword = $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD'];
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
```
