VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to an authorization bypass vulnerability due to inadequate role-based access control.

EXPLANATION:
The resetPassword method checks if the requestingUser is authenticated before proceeding. However, the role-based access control is incomplete and relies solely on a switch statement to determine if the requestingUser has the required privileges to reset the password. The current implementation only checks for GUEST and USER roles, but it does not specify what happens if the requestingUser has an ADMIN or OPERATOR role. This assumption that they should be authorized to reset the password is implicit and may lead to problems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement explicit checks for each role. Instead of having a default case that implicitly authorizes the requestingUser to reset the password if they don't have a GUEST or USER role, explicitly state what roles are allowed to perform this action.
2. Use a more robust access control mechanism that is less prone to implicit authorization. Instead of relying solely on enums and switch statements, consider using attribute-based access control or a more complex role-based access control framework.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  public enum Roles {ADMIN,OPERATOR,USER,GUEST}
                     public void resetPassword(User requestingUser, User user, String password ){
                        if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
                              switch(requestingUser.role){
                                    case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       case USER:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       default:setPassword(user,password);break;}
                                 }
                           
                           else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
                     }
