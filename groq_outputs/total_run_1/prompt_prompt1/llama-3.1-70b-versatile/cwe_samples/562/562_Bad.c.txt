VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function 'getName' is returning a local variable, which is a potential memory-related vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The function 'getName' is defined to return a char pointer, but it's returning a local variable 'name' that is declared on the stack. When the function returns, the memory allocated for 'name' is deallocated. However, the caller of 'getName' might try to access this deallocated memory, leading to undefined behavior. This can cause a segmentation fault, or potentially be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following options:

1. Allocate memory dynamically using 'malloc' or 'new', and ensure it's freed by the caller when it's no longer needed. However, keep in mind that dynamic memory allocation can lead to other issues like memory leaks.

2. Instead of returning a pointer, consider returning a struct or class that includes the string, or a smart pointer that automatically manages the memory.

3. Change the function to fill in a provided buffer instead of returning a pointer.

Here is an example of the latter:

```cpp
void getName(char* buffer, size_t len) {
    fillInName(buffer);
}
```

However, the best approach would depend on the specific requirements of your code and the context in which 'getName' is being used.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
char* getName() {char name[STR_MAX];fillInName(name);return name;}
```
