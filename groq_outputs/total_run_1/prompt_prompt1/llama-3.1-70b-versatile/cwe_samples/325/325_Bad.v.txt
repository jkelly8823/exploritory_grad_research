VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The HMAC module is configured to use externally-provided key hashes (.ikey_hash_i and .okey_hash_i) without performing proper validation or authentication of these inputs.

EXPLANATION:
While HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) is a secure authentication protocol, relying on externally-provided key hashes can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly validated. In the given code, the HMAC module directly uses .ikey_hash_i and .okey_hash_i without any checks or verifications, which can allow an attacker to manipulate the key hashes and potentially bypass authentication or inject fake data. This can be particularly problematic if the HMAC module is used for secured data transmission or storage.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, implement input validation for .ikey_hash_i and .okey_hash_i. Verify that the provided key hashes meet the expected length and format requirements. Additionally, consider implementing authentication mechanisms for these inputs, such as cryptographic signatures or MACs. The HMAC module should only use validated and authenticated key hashes.
