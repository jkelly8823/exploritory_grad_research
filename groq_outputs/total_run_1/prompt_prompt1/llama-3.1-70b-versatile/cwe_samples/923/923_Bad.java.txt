VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Direct Data Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Data Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. An IDOR occurs when an application allows an attacker to directly access or manipulate sensitive data objects, such as user IDs, without proper authorization and validation. In this case, the app directly passes the userID from an intent to the destroyUserData method without validating if the user is authorized to delete the data with that ID.

Additionally, another issue is identified in this code. It appears to be using a BroadcastReceiver. The class "DeleteReceiver" is extending the BroadcastReceiver, and it expects to be handling an Intent. However, when registering the receiver it is using a different receiver, i.e., MyReceiver. It is crucial to ensure the same receiver class is being used. Otherwise, it could result in code that will never be executed, or another unexpected class could be executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Validate the requester's permission to access and delete the requested userData: Validate the username and password or other authorization methods passed in the intent before accessing or deleting the userData.
2. Use Intent action Strings carefully: Actions Strings should be assigned a unique name with the package prefix. This means this app is vulnerable as it is using "com.example.RemoveUser". A better choice would be something such as 'yourcompany.RemoveUser'.
3.  Correctly Associate the Receiver with Intent:  Ensure that you are correctly associating the receiver with the intent. The correct association needs to be used for both registering the receiver and within the receiver. In this example, both need to be changed to be either "MyReceiver" or "DeleteReceiver".


ORIGINAL CODE:
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
registerReceiver(receiver, filter);

public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
destroyUserData(userID);
}}
