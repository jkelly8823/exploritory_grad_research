VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Format String Injection, or Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code presented here is susceptible to a command injection vulnerability. The issue is that the code uses `sprintf` to directly incorporate the `DIR` define into a command string, which is then executed using `system`. An attacker with control over the `DIR` path, potentially through some other means in the full code, could inject malicious commands or escape the intended directory.

In this specific case, the `ls` command is executed with an argument taken directly from `DIR`. If an attacker could control or manipulate `DIR`, they could inject additional commands using command injection techniques (e.g., using semicolons or backticks to separate commands), potentially escalating privileges or achieving other malicious goals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Avoid using user-controlled data with `system`**: Directly passing user-controlled data into commands executed with `system` introduces significant risks. Instead, consider using functions like `exec` or `fork` which allow more fine-grained control over argument and environment management.
2. **Validate and sanitize directory paths**: Implement strict path validation to ensure that directory paths comply with expected values. This can be as simple as checking that the path begins with a hardcoded string (`"/restricted/directory"`) before injecting it into commands.
3. **Use safer interfaces**: Avoid building string commands with `sprintf`. Instead, consider using an API that allows constructing commands from discrete arguments, reducing opportunities for injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define DIR "/restricted/directory"
char cmd[500];sprintf(cmd, "ls -l %480s", DIR);
/* Raise privileges to those needed for accessing DIR. */
RaisePrivileges(...);system(cmd);DropPrivileges(...);...
```
