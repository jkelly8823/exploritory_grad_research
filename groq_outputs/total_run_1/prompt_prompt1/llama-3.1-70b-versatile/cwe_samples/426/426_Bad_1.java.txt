VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: Line containing the exec() call/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to command injection attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The use of the `System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method to directly execute a system command introduces a security vulnerability. The command string "make" is hardcoded in this example, but if the command string were to come from an untrusted source, such as user input, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands to compromise the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Use an alternative method to execute the system command that does not involve directly invoking the command line. For example, you can use the `ProcessBuilder` class to execute the command with a more restrictive set of permissions.

2. Sanitize and validate any input from untrusted sources to prevent command injection attacks. If the command string is provided by the user, ensure that only authorized commands are permitted.

3. Use a more robust method to verify the identity of the caller and authorize their access to execute specific system commands.

4. Consider using a secure-by-design framework that abstracts away the details of system command execution and provides inherent security guarantees.
