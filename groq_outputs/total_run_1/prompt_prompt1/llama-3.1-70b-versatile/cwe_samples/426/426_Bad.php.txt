VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Command Injection Vulnerability (CWE-78, CWE-269)

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the line where the `$command` variable is constructed by concatenating a fixed string with the `$userName` variable, which is then passed to the `system()` function. Although the code assumes that `getCurrentUser()` returns an alphanumeric username, this is not sufficient to prevent a command injection attack. This is because the `grep` command itself can be injected by a malicious username containing special characters. For example, if the username contains a pipe (`|`) character, an attacker could inject additional commands.

Even though CWE-78 (Command Injection) is being avoided to a certain extent by having an alphanumeric username, there still exists CWE-269 (Unrestricted Privilege to Change Consumption) where an attacker can provide a specific input using which the `grep` command used in conjunction with `ps aux` can reflect or grab system information.

If the value of `$userName` can indeed be influenced in any way by an attacker (directly or indirectly), even with the assumption that `getCurrentUser()` returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric, we have to concede there is vulnerability here.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the `$userName` variable: Although we are confident `getCurrentUser()` would not include any special characters, make sure to prevent any errors that might occur during command construction.
2. Use parameterized commands: Instead of constructing the command as a string and passing it to the `system()` function, use an array to store the command and its arguments. This will help to ensure that the command is executed correctly and prevent command injection attacks.
3. Use a safer alternative to `grep`: If possible, use a safer alternative to `grep` that is less prone to injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```php
//assume getCurrentUser() returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric (avoiding CWE-78)
$userName = getCurrentUser();
$command = 'ps aux | grep ' . $userName;
system($command);
```
