VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks due to the data-dependent behavior in the `always` block.

EXPLANATION:
The given code is part of a digital circuit implementing an AES wrapper. The `case` statement inside the `always` block is used to assign values to different parts of the `p_c` array based on the `address` variable. However, the assignment is conditional upon the `reglk_ctrl_i[3]` register. If this register is set to 1, the `p_c` array is not updated; otherwise, it is. This data-dependent behavior can potentially allow an attacker to infer information about the secret key being processed.

Moreover, the assignment to `p_c` array parts uses `wdata[31:0]`, which is a 32-bit slice of a register. However, the type and bit width of `p_c` are not specified. If the array elements are less than 32 bits in size, this could lead to truncation of data, making it vulnerable to data leakage.

Another concern is that the design does not seem to implement any form of secure key masking, which could expose the secret key being processed to timing attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement secure key masking: The secret key should be masked while being processed to prevent any potential timing side-channel attacks.
2. Ensure uniform access time: All cases in the `case` statement should take the same amount of time to execute to prevent attackers from inferring information about the secret key.
3. Verify data type: Verify the type and bit width of `p_c` array to ensure it matches the width of the assigned data `wdata[31:0]`.
4. Use secure coding practices: Implement secure coding practices for the design, such as avoiding data-dependent behavior, ensuring uniform execution times for all cases, and keeping sensitive information hidden during processing.

ORIGINAL CODE:


module aes0_wrapper #(...)(...);
...
always @(posedge clk_i)

 begin

   if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset

     begin

       start <= 0;
       p_c[0] <= 0;
       p_c[1] <= 0;
       p_c[2] <= 0;
       p_c[3] <= 0;
       ...

     end

   else if(en && we)

     case(address[8:3])

     0:

       start  <= reglk_ctrl_i[1] ? start  : wdata[0];

     1:

       p_c[3] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[3] : wdata[31:0];

     2:

       p_c[2] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[2] : wdata[31:0];

     3:

       p_c[1] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[1] : wdata[31:0];

     4:

       p_c[0] <= reglk_ctrl_i[3] ? p_c[0] : wdata[31:0];

     ...

     endcase

   end // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)
