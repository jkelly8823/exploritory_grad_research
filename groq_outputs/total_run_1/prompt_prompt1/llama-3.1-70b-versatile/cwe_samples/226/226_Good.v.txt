VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains an asynchronous reset condition that can lead to timing-related issues and potential glitches.

EXPLANATION:
The line of code "if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1))" checks for a reset condition by performing a logical operation on two reset signals: "rst_ni" and "rst_1". However, this operation is done outside of a designated reset condition, and instead it's used to signal a clear operation on the 'p_c' variable. The reset might be asynchronous, leading to unpredictable timing-related issues, such as glitches in digital circuits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The use of asynchronous reset in this code segment can be replaced by synchronous reset. A better approach would be to clear 'p_c' only when the designated reset signal ("rst_ni" in this case) is asserted. This can be done inside an initial reset block and also ensure a set period of time for which reset signal asserted before it goes away (a common rule of thumb is at least 5x the longest clock period).
```javascript
always @(posedge clk_i)
begin
  if (!rst_ni) 
   //clear on reset
   begin
     p_c[0] <= 0;
     p_c[1] <= 0;
     p_c[2] <= 0;
     p_c[3] <= 0;
   end
   else
   //rest of the code...
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module aes0_wrapper #(...)(...);
...
always @(posedge clk_i)
begin
  if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset
  ...
  else if(ct_valid) //encryption process complete, clear p_c[i]
  begin
    p_c[0] <= 0;
    p_c[1] <= 0;
    p_c[2] <= 0;
    p_c[3] <= 0;
  end
...
  else if(en && we)
  case(address[8:3])
  ...
  endcase
  end // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)
endmodule
