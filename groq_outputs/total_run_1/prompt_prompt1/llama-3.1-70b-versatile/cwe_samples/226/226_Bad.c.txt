VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential memory leakage and/or sensitive information exposure through an insecure use of memory reallocation.

EXPLANATION:
The given code segment reallocate memory for the `cleartext_buffer` using `realloc`. Although the memory is scrubbed after the allocation, the issue lies in the fact that the original memory block is not immediately scrubbed before the reallocation. This could lead to sensitive information being exposed if an attacker can gain access to the memory before the `scrub_memory` function is executed. This vulnerability is further complicated by the fact that the original memory block's contents remain accessible until the memory is physically scrubbed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Move the scrubbing of sensitive information to immediately after it is no longer needed. 
2. Use a secure form of memory allocation and deallocation, which zeroes out memory following free and/or reallocation. Examples of this include the `Explicit_bzero()` function in OpenSSL.
3. Implement a secure and timely scrubbing of sensitive information from the `cleartext_buffer` following the reallocation. This would be best performed by including a scrubbing process immediately following the `get_secret()` function, or any other use of the sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
           cleartext_buffer = get_secret();...cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024);...scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024);
