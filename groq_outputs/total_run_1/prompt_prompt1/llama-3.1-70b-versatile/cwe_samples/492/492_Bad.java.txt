VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The class 'urlTool' extends 'Applet' but it does not override 'destroy' method from 'Applet' and 'close' is not explicitly called on 'urlHelper' which may lead to potential resource leak or some malicious code still being executed.

EXPLANATION:
The source of this vulnerability lies in the fact that Applets were designed to have a specific lifecycle. Applets may outlive the page they were initially loaded in and continue to execute potentially malicious code. To prevent potential vulnerabilities when working with Java's Applet, we should implement the 'destroy' method and free up any resources. 

Additionally, as the presented code uses legacy technologies like Applet, it may pose risks for the system that uses this code. The applet is still useful for some legacy situations, but you should review the code to ensure security compliance and up-to-date best practices.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use the newer 'JPanel' class and the Swing library instead of Applets.
2. Override 'destroy' method from 'Applet' class in order to release any resources.
3. Use try-catch blocks for releasing resources in case of error to avoid resource leaks.
4. Mark the 'urlHelper' object for garbage collection or use try-with-resources statement for resource cleanup.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public final class urlTool extends Applet {
    private final class urlHelper {...}
    ...
}
```
