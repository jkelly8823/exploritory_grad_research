VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The vulnerability in this code is related to the storage of sensitive data. Both 'accountOwnerSSN' and 'accountOwnerName' are stored in plain text as private string variables within the BankAccount class. Sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, should never be stored in plain text due to the high risk of confidentiality breach.

EXPLANATION: 
In the given code, sensitive information such as the account owner's name and SSN is stored as private string variables. This means that anyone with access to the BankAccount object can retrieve this sensitive information. Storing sensitive information in plain text is a serious security risk. In the event of a breach, this sensitive information can be easily accessed by unauthorized parties. 

Furthermore, Social Security numbers should always be stored securely and in compliance with relevant data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, sensitive information should be stored securely using techniques such as encryption. Here are some recommendations for improving the security of the BankAccount class:

- Use a secure method to store sensitive information, such as encrypting the data.
- Implement Access Control to limit who can access the sensitive information.
- Consider using a secure storage mechanism, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM), to store sensitive information.
- Remove sensitive information such as SSN if it is not necessary for the functioning of the application.
- Mask or hash sensitive information where possible.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class BankAccount {
    // private member variables of BankAccount class
    private String accountOwnerName;private String accountOwnerSSN;private int accountNumber;private double balance;
    
    // constructor for BankAccount class
    public BankAccount(String accountOwnerName, String accountOwnerSSN,int accountNumber, double initialBalance, int initialRate){
        this.accountOwnerName = accountOwnerName;
        this.accountOwnerSSN = accountOwnerSSN;
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
        this.start(initialRate);
    }
    
    // start method will add interest to balance every 30 days
    public void start(double rate){
        ActionListener adder = new InterestAdder(rate);
        Timer t = new Timer(1000 * 3600 * 24 * 30, adder);
        t.start();
    }
    
    // InterestAdder is an inner class of BankAccount class
    private class InterestAdder implements ActionListener{
        private double rate;
        public InterestAdder(double aRate){
            this.rate = aRate;
        }
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event){
            double interest = BankAccount.this.balance * rate / 100;
            BankAccount.this.balance += interest;
        }
    }
}
