VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure coding practices: 
Static methods with non-final values that are accessible to external methods pose great security risk. Access specifier in the Static declaration is misplaced
EXPLANATION:
This class Lebesgue that implements Integration, contains method youAreHidingThisFunction which is declared as "public final Static". The problem with this function is, an access specifier is misplaced in the Static declaration, Access specifier must be the last in the method declaration, also variable "functionToIntegrate" is not explicitly named type to be parameterized. Another issue with this code, we do not know what the variable 'functionToIntegrate' actually is as it is not giving name to its data type.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Here are some recommendations for this method:

1 - Change the order of the keyword "public final Static"  so access specifier should not be with static. 
   For example: "public static final" 

2 - Include type of 'functionToIntegrate' variable so reader should know data type it hold.

Here is example when you apply these modifications:

public static final int youAreHidingThisFunction(int functionToIntegrate)


   Also you can make this method private, depends upon you function's accessibility you want.


ORIGINAL CODE:
package math;public class Lebesgue implements Integration{
       public final Static String youAreHidingThisFunction(functionToIntegrate){
              return ...;
       }
  }
