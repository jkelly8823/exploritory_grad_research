VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses the eval() function with user-provided input, which is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The eval() function evaluates a string as a Python expression. When used with untrusted or user-provided input, an attacker can inject malicious Python code that can be executed by the application, leading to arbitrary code execution attacks. In this case, an attacker can inject code that can access the application's memory, modify its behavior, or perform other malicious actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using eval(), use a safer method to parse the input string into numbers. For example, you can use the str.split() and map() functions to split the input string into a list of numbers.

```python
def main():
    sum = 0
    numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ")
    numbers = list(map(int, numbers.split()))
    for num in numbers:
        sum = sum + num
    print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")

main()
```

Alternatively, you can use a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur when parsing the input string, to prevent the application from crashing.

```python
def main():
    sum = 0
    numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ")
    try:
        numbers = list(map(int, numbers.split()))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a space-separated list of numbers.")
        return
    for num in numbers:
        sum = sum + num
    print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")

main()
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def main():
    sum = 0
    numbers = eval(input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: "))
    for num in numbers:
        sum = sum + num
    print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")

main()
```
