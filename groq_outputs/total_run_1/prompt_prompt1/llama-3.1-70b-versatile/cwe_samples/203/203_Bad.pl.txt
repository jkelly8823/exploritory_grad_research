VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a classic instance of a SQL injection or parameter tampering, and does not sanitise user input, enabling possible injections of SQL Injection through crafted parameter entries.

EXPLANATION:
The use of unvalidated and unsanitized input directly from user input to param calls can immediately indicate an exploitable situation using carefully constructed input strings. However, any use of param from user input immediately sets off major flags.
  
Moreover, since there is clearly some security procedure installed in subroutines, we have no true idea if those sub procedures actually sanitise inputs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use strict validation on all parameters and input values.
2. Make sure the (IsValidUsername) and (IsValidPassword) methods sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
3. Follow the principle of least privilege and restrictive access to limit the potential impact in case of an exploitation.
4. Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
5. Consider using prepared statements with placeholder values for inputs to increase the level of security in database interactions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $username = param('username');
my $password = param('password');

if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1) {
  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1) {
    print "Login Successful";
  } else {
    print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
  }
} else {
  print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
```
