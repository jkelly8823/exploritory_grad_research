VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated User Input
EXPLANATION:
The code directly assigns user input from the POST request to variables $user and $pass without proper validation or sanitization. This leaves the application vulnerable to various attacks, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). The lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, validate and sanitize user input thoroughly. You can use PHP's built-in functions such as filter_var() or Zend validaror framework to validate user input. Additionally, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

It is also recommended to use a PHP framework that provides built-in validation and sanitization features.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
