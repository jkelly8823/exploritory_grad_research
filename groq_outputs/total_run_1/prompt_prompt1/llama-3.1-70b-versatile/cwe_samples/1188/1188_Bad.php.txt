VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability due to the lack of input validation and the reliance on a single variable ($authorized) to control access to the generatePage function.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of a user authentication system. The function login_user($user,$pass) is called to authenticate the user, and if successful, sets the $authorized variable to true. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the user-provided input ($user and $pass) before passing it to the login_user function. This lack of input validation could potentially lead to authentication bypass vulnerabilities if the login_user function does not properly handle malicious input. Additionally, relying solely on the $authorized variable to control access to the generatePage function can be exploitable if an attacker can manipulate the $authorized variable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Implement input validation and sanitization on $user and $pass to ensure they do not contain malicious input.
2. Ensure the login_user function properly handles and validates the provided inputs ($user and $pass).
3. Consider using a more secure authentication system that uses tokens or other secure methods to verify user identity.
4. Consider adding additional security checks within the generatePage function to ensure only authorized users can access it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
...
if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
```
