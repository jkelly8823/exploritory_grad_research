VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Assignment in Conditional Statement Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
In the given segment of code, there is a vulnerability in the conditional statement. The condition in the if statement is `value=100`, which is an assignment statement, not a comparison statement. This will always assign the value 100 to the variable `value` and then evaluate the result as true. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. 

The correct operator for comparison in this case should be `==`, not `=`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the assignment operator `=` should be replaced with the comparison operator `==` in the conditional statement. The corrected code is:

```c
int isValid(int value) {
    if (value==100) {
        printf("Value is valid\n");
        return(1);
    }
    printf("Value is not valid\n");
    return(0);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
```
