VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of `free()` on an array of automatic storage duration objects.

EXPLANATION:
The `bar` variable is declared as an array of `record_t` objects, which means it is an array of automatic storage duration. The `free()` function is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`. However, attempting to `free()` an array of automatic storage duration objects can result in undefined behavior. In this case, it's likely to cause a runtime error because the memory was not allocated on the heap.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should not use `free()` on an array of automatic storage duration objects. Instead, let the array go out of scope to deallocate its memory. If you need to manually manage the memory of an array, use dynamic memory allocation functions like `malloc()` and `free()` or smart pointers.

Here's a revised version of the code:
```c
record_t* bar = (record_t*)malloc(MAX_SIZE * sizeof(record_t));
if (bar == NULL) {
    // Handle memory allocation error
}

// do something interesting with bar
...
free(bar);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
record_t bar[MAX_SIZE]; //Global var
void foo(){
    /* do something interesting with bar */
    ...free(bar);
}
```
