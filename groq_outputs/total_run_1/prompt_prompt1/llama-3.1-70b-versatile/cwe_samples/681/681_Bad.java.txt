VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A narrowing primitive conversion vulnerability is present. The code attempts to cast a float value to an integer, potentially resulting in data loss.

EXPLANATION:
The given code casts a float value (33457.8f) to an integer, which can lead to truncation of the decimal part. This could result in unintended behavior or incorrect results if the decimal part is significant.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this issue, consider using a more precise data type, such as a double or a long, to store the value. If an integer is required, ensure that you explicitly round the float value before converting it to an integer. Be cautious when casting between types to avoid losing precision.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int i = (int) 33457.8f;
