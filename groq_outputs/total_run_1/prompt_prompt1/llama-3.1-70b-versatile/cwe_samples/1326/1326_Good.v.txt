VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that `raddr_q` is not validated for its range before being used as an index for `mem` array. If `raddr_q` exceeds the bounds of the array, this can result in a hardware description language (HDL) simulation error, or potentially incorrect behavior in the synthesised hardware. Although line 3-4 attempts to prevent the propagation of incorrect values by assigning `'0` when `raddr_q` is out of bounds, the actual index calculation on line 3 still accesses an out-of-bounds index of `mem` when `raddr_q` is beyond the size of the array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, we recommend adding input validation to ensure that `raddr_q` is always within the valid range of indices for `mem`. The corrected code would look like this:
```
always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
    if (req_i) begin
        localparam int unsigned MAX_ADDROFFSET = RomSize - 1;
        localparam int unsigned MIN_ADDROFFSET = 0;
        if (addr_i >= MIN_ADDROFFSET && addr_i <= MAX_ADDROFFSET) begin
            raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];
        end else begin
            raddr_q <= MIN_ADDROFFSET;
        end
    end
end
```

Alternatively, we recommend considering using SystemVerilog's bounds checking feature to prevent such vulnerabilities. Also, a correct assignment would be using raddr_q inbounds to prevent any possibilities of invalid index usage.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                            ...
                            always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
                                if (req_i) begin
                                        raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];
                                end
                            end
                        ...
                        
                                // this prevents spurious Xes from propagating into the speculative fetch stage of the core
                            
                            assign rdata_o = (raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;
                            ...
```
