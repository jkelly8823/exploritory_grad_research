VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a potential null pointer dereference or buffer overflow vulnerability, along with an unprotected dynamically-sized output which could lead to an information leak. In some instances, format strings could have negative impacts as well. Using strings against printf and no checking are two big issues in this section, on the variable test_string being assigned after the declaration and no size checking implemented for it. Also the code above can result in a garbage value (gibberish) output, undefined behavior, from the printf("%s", test_string); statement when printf'ing i != err_val is NEVER met.


EXPLANATION:
The `test_string` variable is initialized with a static string in two different scenarios based on the value of variable `i` with respect to `err_val`. While this itself does not raise a significant concern, the lack of input validation in conjunction with an unchecked assignment could expose the possibility that this string can potentially point to an unknown or dynamically generated address.
However in general it is needed that both assign string would point to a memory area known by you and it seems `test_string` in above code is assigned to two different known locations. Although, other possible problems arise from printing directly any user data input from printf without checking for possible % specifiers an attacker may perform injection. One of the potential problems - format string attacks /vulnerability could result from printf specified as above.



RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent potential security issues, you can recommend below fixes to this code snippet:
 
 1. Ensure to validate inputs (variable i respect to err_val).

 2. Assign memory for variable test_string and allocate appropriate space for the string about to be placed there, i.e., initialize with NULL and implement realloc with if realloc checks after it's usage for memory errors, or implement string copy with minimum char width - usually one, and check error reporting for success of function execution. Make sure to do a complete error reporting when an operation fails, memory check for assignments/zero pointer condition. These provide the detection with more accuracy of the occurrence. Since array of 10 i.e., a string as you used, if copy string as `strcpy()` function makes sure that while copying strings one at a time string values and also add \0 onto the string on all 2 different locations you assign statically.

 3. Bound check printf function. Check for null pointer check and check for format specifiers to prevent unwanted format string /vulnerability attacks...



ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char *test_string;
if (i != err_val) {
test_string = "Hello World!";
}
else {
test_string = "Done on the other side!";
}
printf("%s", test_string);
```
