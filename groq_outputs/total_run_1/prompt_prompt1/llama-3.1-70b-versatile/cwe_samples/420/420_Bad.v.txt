VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an information disclosure through potential unintended logical operation exposure.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the hardcoded hexadecimal value '32'hF00', which could be a private or sensitive address. The use of this value in a conditional statement can lead to unintended disclosure of security information, such as authentication addresses, through binary analysis or reverse engineering. An attacker could exploit this to determine if a certain IP address or location is being used for a sensitive operation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the sensitive address '32'hF00' should be defined as a named constant or parameter that can be easily managed and updated, rather than being hardcoded directly in the code. Additionally, access to this sensitive information should be restricted and follow the principle of least privilege.

ORIGINAL CODE:
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00) ? 1: 0;
