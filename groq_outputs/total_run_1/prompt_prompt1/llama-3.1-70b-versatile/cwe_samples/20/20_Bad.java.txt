VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper Input Validation leading to Unintended Arithmetic Operation and Potential Arithmetic Overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The code segment presented appears vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. The variable 'quantity' is directly sourced from the 'currentUser.getAttribute("quantity")' function, and is not validated or sanitized for type or range before being used in the arithmetic calculation 'price * quantity'. If an attacker were able to manipulate the 'quantity' attribute to a value that causes the integer to overflow, it would result in an unanticipated result. This could lead to unintended behavior such as infinite loops, crashes or even arbitrary code execution. In this scenario, total charges can also be miscalculated.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Validate the 'quantity' attribute: Before performing any arithmetic operation with 'quantity', it's crucial to check for its range and avoid underflow or overflow. Ensure 'quantity' is greater than or equal to 0 and doesn't exceed the maximum range that 'double' data type can handle when multiplied with 'price'.

2.  Perform type conversion to prevent overflow: Consider changing the 'quantity' data type to a larger type to prevent integer overflow. In cases where 'quantity' could exceed maximum possible integer, type it with larger integer handler data type like, 'long'.

3.  Adding exception handling: When performing the multiplication operation, surround it with a try/except block to catch potential arithmetic overflows and provide more meaningful error messages.

EXAMPLE OF RECOMMENDATION APPLIED:

```java
public static final double price = 20.00;
int quantity;
try {
    quantity = Integer.parseInt(currentUser.getAttribute("quantity"));
    if (quantity < 0) {
        throw new Exception("Quantity can't be lower than 0");
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
if (quantity > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 20) {
    System.out.println(" Quantity exceeds limit and multiply was not performed.");
} else {
    try {
        double total = price * quantity;
        chargeUser(total);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public static final double price = 20.00;  
int quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");
double total = price * quantity;  
chargeUser(total);```
