VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a basic bounds check for an array index. It ensures that the 'index' variable is within the valid range of the array (from 0 to 'len-1'). Since proper bounds checking is in place, buffer overflows or out-of-bounds errors are unlikely to occur. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
