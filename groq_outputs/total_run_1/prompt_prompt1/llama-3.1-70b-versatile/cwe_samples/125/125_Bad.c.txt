VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow/Out-of-Bounds Access Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The given code attempts to check the validity of an array index by comparing it to the array length. However, it only checks that the index is less than the maximum length, but it does not check that the index is greater than or equal to 0. In addition, when an invalid index is encountered, the code prints an error message to the console using the invalid index. The printf statement is attempting to access the memory location pointed to by array at index 'index' which is still potentially out-of-bounds. This is an arbitrary access to an unspecified memory location and should be considered a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add an additional check to ensure that the index is also greater than or equal to 0. Also, you should not attempt to access the memory location in the case of an invalid index. Instead, you could provide a meaningful error message. Here is the corrected code:
```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= len) {
        printf("Error: Index out of bounds\n");
        return -1;
    }
    return array[index];
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
                        
                           int value;
                           
                           // check that the array index is less than the maximum
                           
                           
                           // length of the array
                           if (index < len) {
                              
                                 
                                 // get the value at the specified index of the array
                                 value = array[index];
                           }
                           // if array index is invalid then output error message
                           
                           
                           // and return value indicating error
                           else {printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);value = -1;}
                           return value;
                     }
```
