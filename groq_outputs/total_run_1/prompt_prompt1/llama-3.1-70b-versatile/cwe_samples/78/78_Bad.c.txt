VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system function, potentially leading to unauthorized access or system crashes.

EXPLANATION:
The code concatenates user input (argv[1]) to a command string using the strcat function and then passes it to the system function for execution. However, the user input is not sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands. For example, an attacker could provide input that escapes the original command string and injects additional commands, potentially executing malicious code. This is especially problematic because the system function executes the command in a shell, allowing the attacker to manipulate the system's behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid using system or exec functions with user-supplied input. Instead, use functions that allow for more control over the command execution, such as execve.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and patterns. In this case, ensure that argv[1] only contains valid file names.
3. Use a more secure approach to executing commands, such as using a template string and positional arguments, or using a library that provides secure command execution.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
    strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
    system(cmd);
}
```
