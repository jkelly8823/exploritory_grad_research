VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet retrieves a system property named "SCRIPTNAME" and then executes it using the `System.exec()` method without any validation or sanitization. If an attacker can manipulate the value of the "SCRIPTNAME" system property, they can inject arbitrary system commands, potentially allowing them to execute malicious code with the privileges of the application. This is a classic example of a Command Injection vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should never directly execute user-provided or potentially tampered data as system commands. Instead, consider the following recommendations:

1. Validate and sanitize the input: Ensure that the value of the "SCRIPTNAME" system property is valid and does not contain any malicious characters or commands.
2. Use a whitelisting approach: Only allow the execution of specific, pre-approved scripts or commands.
3. Use a secure execution mechanism: Instead of using `System.exec()`, consider using a more secure mechanism, such as the `ProcessBuilder` class, which provides more control over the execution environment.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String script = System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME");if (script != null)System.exec(script);
