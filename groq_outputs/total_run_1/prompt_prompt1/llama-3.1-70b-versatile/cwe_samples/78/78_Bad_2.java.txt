VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in the code is a Command Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to code execution, data tampering, and other malicious activities.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is caused by directly using user-supplied input (`request.getParameter("backuptype")`) in a system command without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the input to inject malicious commands, which would be executed by the system. This can be done by adding special characters or commands to the input, such as semicolons, ampersands, or pipe characters.

In this specific case, the `btype` parameter is concatenated with the command to be executed, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a safer approach to execute system commands:

1. Use a Whitelist: Validate the `btype` input against a predefined whitelist of allowed values.
2. Avoid using `System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`: Instead, use a more secure way to execute system commands, such as using the `ProcessBuilder` class or a library that provides a safe way to execute commands.
3. Use Escaping: If you must use the `System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method, properly escape the user input to prevent command injection.

Example of using `ProcessBuilder` with a whitelist validation:
```java
String[] allowedBackupTypes = {"full", "incremental", "daily"};

String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");

if (Arrays.asList(allowedBackupTypes).contains(btype)) {
    String[] cmd = {"c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat", btype, "&&", "c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat"};
    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(cmd);
    pb.start();
} else {
    // Handle invalid input
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");
String cmd = new String("cmd.exe /K \"c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat "+btype+"&&c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat\"");
System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
```
