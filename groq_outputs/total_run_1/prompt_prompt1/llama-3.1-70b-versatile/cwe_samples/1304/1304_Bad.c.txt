VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite recursion due to self-calling function without base condition.

EXPLANATION:
The function `save_config_state()` contains an infinite recursion vulnerability. On line 5, the function calls itself recursively with the same argument `cfg` without any base condition or logic that stops the recursion. This can cause a stack overflow as each recursive call consumes more stack space, eventually leading to the program crashing. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the recursive call should be removed and replaced with a call to a different function that is intended to handle the contents of the `cfg` variable. Alternatively, if recursion is absolutely necessary, a base condition should be added to stop the recursion when a certain condition is met.

For example:
```cpp
void save_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    cfg = get_config_state();
    save_cfg_file(cfg); // Call a different function
    go_to_sleep();
}
```
Alternatively, if recursion is necessary:
```cpp
void save_config_state(void* cfg, int recursion_level)
{
    if (recursion_level >= MAX_RECURSION_LEVEL) {
        // Handle the end of recursion
        return;
    }
    // Perform necessary operations
    save_config_state(cfg, recursion_level + 1);
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
void save_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    cfg = get_config_state();
    save_config_state(cfg); // Infinite recursion
    go_to_sleep();
}

void restore_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    cfg = get_config_file();
    load_config_file(cfg);
}
```
