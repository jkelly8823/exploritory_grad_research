VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Memory Error due to Potential Integer Overflow

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to integer overflow when calculating the allocated memory size. The variable `num_imgs` is multiplied by the size of `img_t` which is 10kB, resulting in a potentially large number. If `num_imgs` is a large value, this multiplication could cause an integer overflow, leading to either undefined behavior or a much smaller than expected allocated memory block.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, check the value of `num_imgs` before allocating memory to prevent integer overflow. Use functions that can handle larger values, such as `size_t` for the result of `sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs`. Use `malloc` with `calloc` to ensure that the allocated memory is zeroed out. Consider using a dynamic memory allocation function that returns an error in case of integer overflow. A safer version of the code could look like this:

```cpp
size_t allocation_size = sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs;
if(allocation_size < sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs || allocation_size < sizeof(img_t)) {
    // Handle integer overflow error
}
table_ptr = calloc(num_imgs, sizeof(img_t));
if(table_ptr == NULL) {
    // Handle memory allocation error
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
