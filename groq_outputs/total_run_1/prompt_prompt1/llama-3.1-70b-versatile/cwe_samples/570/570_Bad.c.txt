VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A bitwise operation error is present, potentially allowing unintended access control.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, the `mask` variable is intended to have both the read and write bits set. However, the bitwise AND operator `&` is used instead of the bitwise OR operator `|`. This results in `mask` being equal to zero (`00000000`), as there is no overlap between the read and write bits. As a result, the `hasReadWriteAccess` function will always return 0 (false) regardless of the `userMask` value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, replace the line `unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE;` with `unsigned int mask = BIT_READ | BIT_WRITE;`. This will ensure that the `mask` variable has both the read and write bits set.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #define BIT_READ 0x0001 // 00000001
                  #define BIT_WRITE 0x0010 // 00010000
                     unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE; /* intended to use "|" */
                     // using "&", mask = 00000000
                     // using "|", mask = 00010001
                     // determine if user has read and write access
                     int hasReadWriteAccess(unsigned int userMask) {
                        // if the userMask has read and write bits set
                        // then return 1 (true)
                        if (userMask & mask) {
                            return 1;
                        }
                        // otherwise return 0 (false)
                        return 0;
                     }
