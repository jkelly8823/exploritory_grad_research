VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has an unhandled default case in the switch statement.

EXPLANATION:
The switch statement in the provided code only handles two cases: FAILED (0) and PASSED (1). However, it does not account for any other values that the function security_check(data) might return. This makes the code vulnerable to unexpected behavior or even crashes if security_check(data) returns a value other than FAILED or PASSED.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add a default case to handle any unexpected values returned by security_check(data). The default case can perform an action such as logging an error message, throwing an exception, or taking some other alternative action. Here is an example of how the modified code could look:

```c
switch (result) {
    case FAILED:
        printf("Security check failed!\n");
        exit(-1);
        break;
    case PASSED:
        printf("Security check passed.\n");
        break;
    default:
        // Handle unexpected values
        printf("Security check returned unexpected value %d\n", result);
        // Take some alternative action (e.g., exit, throw exception)
        exit(-2); // or some other meaningful error code
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define FAILED 0
#define PASSED 1

int result;
...
result = security_check(data);
switch (result) {
    case FAILED:
        printf("Security check failed!\n");
        exit(-1);
        //Break never reached because of exit()
        break;
    case PASSED:
        printf("Security check passed.\n");
        break;
}
// program execution continues...
...
```
