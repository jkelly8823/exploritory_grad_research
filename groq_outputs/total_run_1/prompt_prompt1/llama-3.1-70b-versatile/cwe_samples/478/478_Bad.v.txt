VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 18-20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an integer overflow when assigning values to the state register.

EXPLANATION:
In Verilog, the reg type is signed by default if no base is specified, and the bit width determines the possible range of values. The state register has a width of 2 bits (reg [1:0] state;), which means it can only hold values from 0 to 3. However, in the case statement, values greater than 3 are assigned to the state register. This can cause an integer overflow and result in incorrect behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should ensure that the state register can hold the maximum possible value. In this case, we can change the width of the state register to 3 bits (reg [2:0] state();) or ensure that the values assigned to the state register do not exceed the maximum possible value.

It's also recommended to use explicit type definitions (e.g., unsigned) to avoid relying on the default signed type and make the code more readable and maintainable.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
module fsm_1(out, user_input, clk, rst_n);
    input [2:0] user_input; 
    input clk, rst_n;
    output reg [2:0] out;
    reg [1:0] state;
    always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n )
    begin
        if (!rst_n)
            state = 3'h0;
        else
            case (user_input)
                3'h0:
                3'h1:
                3'h2:
                3'h3: state = 2'h3; // incorrect state value assignment
                3'h4: state = 2'h2;
                3'h5: state = 2'h1;
            endcase
    end
    out <= {1'h1, state};
endmodule
