VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code segment.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It is a simple switch statement that handles different cases based on the input values. The code does not include any potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, or other common security concerns. The code appears to be a straightforward user input-based control flow.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
While the given code segment does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities, it would be helpful to know the exact nature and validation of the input variables (input1 and input2). As a general recommendation, consider implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure the variables only hold the expected input formats. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a try-catch block to handle potential runtime errors.
ORIGINAL CODE:

                  let step = input1 + input2;
                  switch(step) {
                  case 1:
                     alert("Process step 1.");
                     break;
                  case 2:
                     alert("Process step 2.");
                     break;
                  case 3:
                     alert("Process step 3.");
                     break;
                  default:
                     alert("Unexpected step encountered.");
                  
                  }
                  // program execution continues...
