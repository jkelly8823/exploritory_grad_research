VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Storage of Credentials
EXPLANATION:
The code contains sensitive database credentials, including username and password, stored in plain text. This is a major security vulnerability as anyone with access to the configuration file can obtain the credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following steps:

1. Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive credentials, such as encrypted files or secure configuration management tools.
2. Remove credentials from the configuration files and provide them through environment variables or configuration APIs.
3. Consider implementing a secure configuration management system that stores sensitive data encrypted.
4. Use secure credentials management practices like Hashicorp's Vault for sensitive data storage and retrieval.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...

Note: Depending on the programming language and framework being used, there might be specific mechanisms available to securely store and manage sensitive credentials that should be leveraged to address this vulnerability.
