VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Out-of-Bounds Array Access vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and out-of-bounds array access. The variable `$num` is obtained from the `GetUntrustedNumber()` function, which implies it might be user-supplied. If the value is negative, or greater than the maximum array index, it will attempt to access an invalid array index. In Perl, this will create a new array element if the index is greater than the current size of the array. This alone should not be a concern. However, using an untrusted source to access an array is potentially a vulnerability as it could lead to additional exploitation.

Furthermore, if this were a hash rather than an array, an untrusted index could potentially reveal information about sensitive keys in the hash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent potential insecure object references, ensure that the untrusted number retrieved from `GetUntrustedNumber()` is validated, sanitized and stays within the allowed bounds of the array.

 Additionally, exception checking should be performed to ensure the code does not attempt to access invalid array indices.

```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();
my @messages = ();

# validate and sanitize the untrusted number
if ($num >= 0) {
    $num = $num > $#messages ? $#messages : $num; # ensure index doesn't exceed the array size
    $messages[$num] = "Hello World";
} else {
    # Handle invalid number (e.g., log the event or throw an exception)
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();my @messages = ();
$messages[$num] = "Hello World";
```
