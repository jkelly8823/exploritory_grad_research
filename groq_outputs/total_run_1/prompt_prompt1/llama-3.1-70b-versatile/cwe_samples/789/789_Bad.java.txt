VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability and Potential Denial of Service

EXPLANATION:
The given code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the unchecked untrusted integer value obtained from `GetUntrustedInt()` being used to allocate memory for the `HashMap`. This untrusted input can cause an Integer Overflow, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when allocating memory for the `HashMap`. Furthermore, allocating an arbitrarily large amount of memory can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input from `GetUntrustedInt()`. Ensure that it is within acceptable bounds to prevent an Integer Overflow.
2. Implement bounds checking for the allocation size to prevent an excessive memory allocation.
3. Consider using a more secure and safer data structure if the use of `HashMap` is not necessary.
4. Ensure that error handling is implemented in case the memory allocation fails.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned int size = GetUntrustedInt();
HashMap list = new HashMap(size);
```
