VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The buffer `buf` is declared with a size that is calculated based on the input `msg_len`, which can be negative, causing a buffer overflow when the size of the buffer is assigned a negative value.

EXPLANATION:
In the function `proc_msg`, the buffer `buf` is declared with a size that is calculated as `pre_len - msg_len`. However, if `msg_len` is greater than `pre_len`, this calculation results in a negative value, causing a buffer overflow. This can occur because the function `proc_msg` assumes that the input `msg_len` is always less than or equal to `pre_len`, but this assumption is not checked. The code also calculates the input `msg_len` as the length of the string up to the colon (:) character, which can be less than the length of the preamble.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should check that the input `msg_len` is not greater than `pre_len` before calculating the size of the buffer `buf`. Additionally, the code should validate the input `msg_len` to ensure that it is not negative. Here's an example of how the code can be fixed:

```c
int proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len)
{
    int pre_len = sizeof("preamble: ") - 1; // Note space at the end of the string - assume all strings have preamble with space
    if (msg_len < 0 || msg_len > pre_len) { 
        // Error handling code here
        return error_code;
    }
    char buf[pre_len - msg_len]; // Now this line will not cause a buffer overflow
    ... Do processing here and set status
    return status;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
int proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len)
{
    int pre_len = sizeof("preamble: ");    // Note space at the end of the string - assume all strings have preamble with space
    if (pre_len <= msg_len) { // Log error; return error_code; }
    char buf[pre_len - msg_len];
    ... Do processing here and set status
    return status;
}

char *s = "preamble: message\n";
char *sl = strchr(s, ':');        // Number of characters up to ':' (not including space)
int jnklen = sl == NULL ? 0 : sl - s;    // If undefined pointer, use zero length
int ret_val = proc_msg ("s",  jnklen);    // Violate assumption of preamble length, end up with negative value, blow out stack
```
