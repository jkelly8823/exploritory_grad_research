VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to insecure key size, weak encryption algorithm, and use of insecure initialization vector (IV).

EXPLANATION:
The KeyGenerator is initialized with a key size of 56 bits, which is considered insecure. According to the AES and Hash Function Transition Plan by the US federal government, a minimum key size of 112 bits is recommended for confidentiality protection. 

Furthermore, the DES encryption algorithm is used, which is also considered insecure due to its relatively small block size and key size. DES has been replaced by AES as the recommended encryption standard. 

Additionally, the initialization vector (IV) is set to all zeros, which can lead to predictable ciphertext. A cryptographically secure random IV should be generated for each encryption operation.

The `cipher.doFinal(inpBytes)` function is also incorrectly calling on a non-existent variable `inpBytes`, which would result in a compilation error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Recommendations include using a stronger encryption algorithm (such as AES), a larger key size (at least 112 bits), and a cryptographically secure random IV. The variable being encrypted should be correctly called upon and assigned to a variable before encryption. Here's an updated version of the code:

```java
public class SymmetricCipherTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Generate a random IV
        byte[] iv = new byte[16];
        SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong().nextBytes(iv);

        // Use AES with a 256-bit key
        KeyGenerator kg = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        kg.init(256);
        SecretKey key = kg.generateKey();

        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        IvParameterSpec ips = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ips);

        // Get the text to be encrypted
        byte[] inpBytes = "Secret".getBytes();

        byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(inpBytes);
        
        // For demonstration purposes, print the encrypted bytes
        System.out.println("Encrypted bytes: " + javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(encryptedBytes));
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class SymmetricCipherTest {
    public static void main() {
        
        byte[] text ="Secret".getBytes();byte[] iv ={0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00};KeyGenerator kg = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");kg.init(56);SecretKey key = kg.generateKey();Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");IvParameterSpec ips = new IvParameterSpec(iv);cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ips);return cipher.doFinal(inpBytes);
    }
}
