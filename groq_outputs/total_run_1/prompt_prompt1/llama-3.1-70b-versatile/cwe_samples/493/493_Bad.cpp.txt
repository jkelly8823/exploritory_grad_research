VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive data

EXPLANATION:
Hardcoding sensitive data directly into the code poses a significant security risk. In this case, the `configPath` variable stores the path to a configuration file containing potentially sensitive information. An attacker with access to the codebase could exploit this hardcoded path to access sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the path to the configuration file, consider one of the following approaches:

1.  **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive paths or values as environment variables, which can be set externally and accessed by the application.
2.  **Load configuration from a secure source:** Load the configuration path from a secure source, such as an encrypted configuration file or a secure key management system.
3.  **Use a secrets management system:** Consider using a secrets management system like HashiCorp's Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Cloud Secret Manager to securely store and manage sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public string configPath = "/etc/application/config.dat";
