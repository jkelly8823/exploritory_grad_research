VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an SQL injection vulnerability and is also using an insecure way to handle POST data using the `extract` function. Additionally, it's using the deprecated `mysql_` extension.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the usage of the `mysql_real_escape_string` function incorrectly. This function is meant to escape special characters in the input, but it's not foolproof and can be bypassed using different techniques. 

Moreover, the usage of the `extract` function is a potential security vulnerability as it can lead to variable injection attacks. 

The `mysql_` extension is also deprecated since PHP 5.5 and removed since PHP 7.0, which makes it insecure to use.

The SQL injection vulnerability in this code is located on the lines where the `login` function is called and the SQL query is built inside the `login` function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `mysql_` extension with `mysqli_` or `PDO`, which provide better security features.
2. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
3. Validate and sanitize the user input to prevent variable injection attacks.
4. Avoid using the `extract` function and instead use `$_POST` array directly.
5. Consider implementing a secure authentication system using established libraries.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  
                     //Log user in, and set $isAdmin to true if user is an administrator
                     
                     function login($user,$pass){$query = buildQuery($user,$pass);mysql_query($query);if(getUserRole($user) == "Admin"){$isAdmin = true;}}
                     $isAdmin = false;extract($_POST);login(mysql_real_escape_string($user),mysql_real_escape_string($pass));
