VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `GetUntrustedInput()` function retrieves user input, which may contain directory traversal sequences (../). Although the code attempts to sanitize the input by removing "../" from the beginning of the string, it does not prevent an attacker from using "../" in other positions or using other traversal sequences like "..\" or "%2e%2e%2f".

In this case, the code joins the user input to a path, allowing an attacker to potentially access files outside the expected directory. The ReadAndSendFile function may then attempt to read and send files that the attacker is not authorized to access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, additional input validation and sanitization should be performed. Here are some recommendations:

1. Use a whitelist approach to validate the input. Only allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dots. Reject any input that contains directory traversal sequences.
2. Use a secure path construction method to avoid direct concatenation of user input to a path. This can be achieved by using a library that provides a secure way to join paths.
3. Implement additional security checks in the ReadAndSendFile function to ensure that only authorized files are accessed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {
    $Username = substr($Username, 3);
}
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
