VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, including the database name and password. This is a serious security vulnerability as it makes it easier for attackers to access the database if the code is compromised or exposed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend storing sensitive data such as database credentials in environment variables or secure configuration files, rather than hardcoding them directly in the code. This will make it more difficult for attackers to access the database credentials. We also recommend using a secure secret management solution to store and manage sensitive data.

Here's an example of how to use environment variables in PHP:

```php
$dbName = getenv('DB_NAME');
$dbPassword = getenv('DB_PASSWORD');
```

And in the .env file (or similar):

```
DB_NAME=usersDB
DB_PASSWORD=skjdh#67nkjd3$3$3
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$dbName = 'usersDB';$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$3$';?>
```
