VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Use of clearProperty followed by getProperty and Unconditional Comparison for String equality.

EXPLANATION:
This code segment demonstrates two potential issues. The first is that it uses a public and static method to remove a system property 'os.name' and then immediately retrieves it again, which could indicate an attempt to bypass any security checks or tamper with the system properties. The second issue is that it performs an unconditional and insecure comparison of the retrieved 'os.name' to a hardcoded string "Windows 95". This could lead to incorrect identification of the operating system or other security-related issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of setting and clearing properties back and forth in short intervals, this operation should likely be performed only when necessary and also should adhere to more robust access control. For instance, restrict property modification using AccessControl mechanisms or via file-level access control. Also, when comparing strings, always check for nullity, and instead of using the equalsIgnoreCase() function for security checks, if needed, then use a case-insensitive comparison method during constant check. The replacement for the first line will depend on the correct operations the function is to supply.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  System.clearProperty("os.name");...String os = System.getProperty("os.name");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase("Windows 95")) System.out.println("Not supported");
