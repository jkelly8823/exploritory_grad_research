VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Resource leak due to missing error handling for pthread_mutex_unlock
EXPLANATION:
The code successfully locks a mutex and checks for errors, but it does not properly check for errors when unlocking the mutex. This could lead to issues if the mutex cannot be unlocked, potentially causing a resource leak or deadlock scenario.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The function should check for and handle errors when unlocking the mutex. If the mutex cannot be unlocked, the function should not return the error code from pthread_mutex_unlock, as this error code could overwrite the original error code from pthread_mutex_lock. Instead, the function should handle the error and return the original error code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    int result;
    result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;
    
    /* access shared resource */
    
    return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```
