VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the code. The strcpy function is used without checking the length of the source string, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the hostname buffer.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the strcpy function to copy the hostname from the hostent structure to a fixed-size buffer. However, the length of the hostname is not checked before copying, allowing an attacker to potentially overflow the buffer if the hostname is longer than the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow attack, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a safer string copying function that checks the length of the source string and ensures that the destination buffer is not overflowed. One such function is strncpy. However, since strncpy does not guarantee null-termination if the source string is truncated, it's better to use snprintf or a similar function. Another approach is to use a dynamically allocated buffer to store the hostname, which would eliminate the possibility of a buffer overflow. Additionally, always validate the return value of the gethostbyaddr function and the h_name field of the hostent structure to ensure that they are not NULL.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
    struct hostent *hp;
    in_addr_t *addr;
    char hostname[64];
    in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);

    /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */

    validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);
    addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);
    hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);
    strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
}
```
