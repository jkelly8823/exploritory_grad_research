VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to unauthorized access through insecure role management and lack of authentication.
 
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the way the code uses the `$_COOKIES['role']` variable to determine user authorization. The role is not validated or sanitized before being used in the authentication process. Additionally, the role can be manipulated by an attacker through cookie tampering. Furthermore, the code uses the `die` function to display an error message, which can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings.

Moreover, the code assumes that the `DisplayMedicalHistory` function only contains information accessible by the 'Reader' role. However, there is no validation that this function does not handle sensitive data accessible by higher roles.

Finally, the code does not handle the case where `getRole('user')` returns a value that does not match any of the expected roles, which could lead to further security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, we recommend the following:

1. Use secure cookie flags: Set the `secure` and `httponly` flags when setting cookies to prevent JavaScript from accessing sensitive data.
2. Validate user input: Ensure that the user's role is validated and sanitized before being used in authentication.
3. Implement secure authentication: Instead of relying on cookies, use a secure authentication system that handles session management and role-based access control.
4. Use prepared statements: When displaying sensitive data, use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
5. Avoid revealing sensitive information: Use a generic error message instead of revealing sensitive information about the application's internal workings.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$role = $_COOKIES['role'];if (!$role) {$role = getRole('user');if ($role) {// save the cookie to send out in future responsessetcookie("role", $role, time()+60*60*2);}else{ShowLoginScreen();die("\n");}}if ($role == 'Reader') {DisplayMedicalHistory($_POST['patient_ID']);}else{die("You are not Authorized to view this record\n");}

Note: It is also important to ensure that the `DisplayMedicalHistory`, `getRole`, and `ShowLoginScreen` functions are secure and do not introduce any additional vulnerabilities.
