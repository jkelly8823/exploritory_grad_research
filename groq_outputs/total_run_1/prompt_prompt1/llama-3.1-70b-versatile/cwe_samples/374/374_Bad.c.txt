VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Command Injection Vulnerability and Potential Resource Leak

EXPLANATION:
The code provided appears to be written in a Java-like programming language. The vulnerability exists in the `doStuff()` method, where it calls `externalClass.doOtherStuff(foo, bar, baz)`. Without proper validation and sanitization of user input, it is possible to inject malicious commands. 

Moreover, the `externalClass` object and its `doOtherStuff()` method are not defined within the provided code, which introduces the potential for a resource leak. This is because `externalClass` might hold onto some external resource, which may not be properly closed or released.

Additionally, the original code does not include proper type definitions for some variables. This might be due to incorrect pseudo-code. 

Assuming the actual type for the `bar` field is of non-primitive type, a potential null pointer exception vulnerability exists. However, with the pseudo-code nature of the content, more code is needed to accurately confirm.

Given just the snippet, multiple problems exist within the snippet. No control measures are shown for dealing with the use of external calls.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Import the correct classes and properly define all types.
2. Validate and sanitize any user input used in the `doOtherStuff()` method to prevent command injection.
3. Use try-with-resources or properly close external resources within `externalClass.doOtherStuff()` to prevent resource leaks.
4. Implement proper null checks for object `externalClass` and the parameters passed to `doOtherStuff()`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
private: int foo;
                complexType bar;
                    String baz;
                         otherClass externalClass;
                    
                       public: void doStuff() {externalClass.doOtherStuff(foo, bar, baz)}`
