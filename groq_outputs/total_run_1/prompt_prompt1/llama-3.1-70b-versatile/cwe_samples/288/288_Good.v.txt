VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Comparison Security Risk.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability may arise due to unexpected integer comparison outcomes. The issue arises from directly comparing the 32-bit hexadecimal representations without considering potential implicit masking or truncation. Furthermore, if the comparison operands may vary in size in some future iteration, or depending on compiler optimization operations on code prior to this, it could under certain conditions give rise to unexpected security risks or vulnerabilities, even if the 32-bit comparison operations seemingly validate properly at present.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To minimize these risks and enhance maintainability and usability of the comparison operation, assign the address comparison values as integers of the same data type. Additionally, define named constants as substitutes for raw literal values.

For example:
```
const uint32_t AUTH_ADDRESS_1 = 32'hF00;
const uint32_t AUTH_ADDRESS_2 = 32'h800F00;
const uint32_t ADDR_MASK = 0xFFFF;

uint32_t address_field = address & ADDR_MASK; 
assign addr_auth = (address_field == AUTH_ADDRESS_1) || (address_field == AUTH_ADDRESS_2) ? 1 : 0;
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00 || address == 32'h800F00) ? 1: 0;
