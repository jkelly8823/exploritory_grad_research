VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Storage of sensitive data in plaintext.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file that stores LDAP credentials. The file contains a clear-text password ("webapp.ldap.password=..."). This is a significant vulnerability as it allows unauthorized access to the LDAP server.

storing sensitive data such as passwords in plaintext is a well-known bad practice, especially when dealing with production-ready systems. Anyone with access to this properties file will be able to obtain the credentials and potentially lead to further system exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Avoid plain-text passwords**: Store passwords securely using environment variables or a secure Key-Store with encryption.
2.  **Use Externalized Configuration**: Instead of hardcoding sensetive data within properties files or in the code, use a configuration framework that loads environment variables (e.g., using environment variables, Spring external configuration, etc.).
3.  **Implement access control**: Restrict access to the properties file or configuration file to only those who require the credentials for maintenance and provide read-only access when needed.
