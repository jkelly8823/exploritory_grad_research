VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to Hardcoded Credentials, which is a type of security risk where sensitive information such as usernames and passwords are embedded in the code.

EXPLANATION:
Hardcoding credentials directly in the code is a severe security vulnerability. If this code is accessed by unauthorized users, they will obtain sensitive information that can be used to gain access to the system, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized data exposure. Furthermore, if the credentials are the same across multiple systems, the vulnerability amplifies.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Store the sensitive information (e.g., LDAP credentials) in environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management solution. Never hardcode credentials in your codebase. Use a secrets management solution that can encrypt the sensitive information to further protect it.
 
Consider the following ways to securely store and retrieve sensitive information:

1.  Environment Variables: Pass the credentials as environment variables to the application when it starts.
2.  Configuration Files: Use encrypted configuration files to store the credentials and provide the file path to the application.
3.  Secrets Management Solution: Integrate a secrets management solution that securely stores and retrieves the credentials.
