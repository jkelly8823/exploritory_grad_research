VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded sensitive data.

EXPLANATION:
The given ResourceBundle properties file contains hardcoded sensitive data, specifically a username and password for an LDAP connection. Hardcoding sensitive data, such as credentials, directly in the code or configuration files is a serious security vulnerability. This is because it makes it easy for an attacker to access the data by simply reviewing the code or configuration files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure approach for storing and retrieving sensitive data. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Environment Variables: Store the sensitive data as environment variables, and then retrieve them in the code. This way, the data is not hard-coded in the code or configuration files.
2. Secure Configuration Files: Store the sensitive data in secure configuration files that are encrypted and only accessible to the application.
3. Secret Management: Use a secret management tool or service, such as Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to securely store and retrieve sensitive data.
