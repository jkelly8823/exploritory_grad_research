VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to HTTP Response Header Injection, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes untrusted data (`untrustedRawInputData`) and inserts it into an HTTP response header without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers, including those that could manipulate the client's behavior or facilitate further attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should sanitize the input data before adding it to the HTTP response headers. This can be done by removing or encoding any sensitive or malicious characters, such as newline characters (`\n`) or carriage return characters (`\r`). Additionally, consider using a whitelist of allowed characters to ensure that only valid data is included in the headers.

You should also validate the input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This can help prevent attacks that rely on malformed or unexpected data.

Lastly, consider using a library or framework that provides built-in support for secure header manipulation, as these can often help prevent common vulnerabilities like this one.

ORIGINAL CODE:
response.addHeader(HEADER_NAME, untrustedRawInputData);
