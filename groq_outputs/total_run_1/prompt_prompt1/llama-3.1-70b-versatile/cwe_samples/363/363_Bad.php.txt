VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper Use of 'echo' for Sensitive Data and Unsanitized File Path

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, there is a function called `readFile` which checks if a file is a symbolic link and then reads its contents. However, there are two major security concerns. Firstly, the variable `$realFile` is not defined anywhere in the function but is used in the echo statement which will raise an error and may also allow an attacker to gain access to arbitrary files by manipulating the error message. This could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure.

Moreover, the use of `is_link()` function alone is not sufficient to prevent a symbolic link attack. If an attacker creates a symbolic link to a sensitive file, the program could potentially leak sensitive data.

Secondly, the `echo` statement for accessing denied should be changed to throw an exception for added security.

Lastly, the code does not have any validation to check for any unacceptable paths being passed to it, such as `'/etc/passwd'`. Also, there is no encryption over data, and non encrypted sensitive data could create vulnerabilities on systems with full disk access granted to unauthorized individuals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, consider implementing the following recommendations:
1. Use try/catch blocks to prevent the code from dying in unexpected ways and throwing an exception when a file is inaccessible.
2. Validate the path and type of the file being passed to this function.
3. Fix the variable name in the `file_get_contents()` function to prevent the error.
4. Encrypt sensitive data for secure file access.
5. Include a warning for potential symbolic link issues in logs where these have concerns and are unable to run system access analysis software.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();
   
    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
}
```
