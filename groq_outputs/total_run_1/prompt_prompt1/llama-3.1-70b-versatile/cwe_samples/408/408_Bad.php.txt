VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to inadequate file validation, allowing unauthorized access to arbitrary files.

EXPLANATION:
The provided function, `printFile`, accepts a `$filename` as an input, but does not perform adequate validation or sanitization on the file name. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass the authorization check (`isOwnerOf` function) and access arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the `$filename` parameter.

The `file_get_contents` function is used to read the contents of the file specified by `$filename`, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, including configuration files, user data, or even system files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Validate and sanitize the `$filename` parameter to ensure that it only allows access to authorized files.
2. Implement least privilege access by limiting the directory and file access to a specific directory.
3. Use a secure way to read files, such as using `fopen` with a specified file mode and validating the file contents.

Also, it is recommended to check the return value of `file_get_contents` and handle potential errors or exceptions.

SAMPLE SECURE CODE:

```php
function printFile($username, $filename) {
    // Define allowed directory
    $allowedDir = '/path/to/authorized/files/';

    // Validate filename
    if (!preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+$/', $filename)) {
        echo 'Invalid filename';
        return false;
    }

    // Sanitize filename
    $filename = $allowedDir . $filename;

    // Check if file exists and is readable
    if (!is_file($filename) || !is_readable($filename)) {
        echo 'File not found or not readable';
        return false;
    }

    // Check if user is authorized
    if (!isOwnerOf($username, $filename)) {
        echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
        return false;
    }

    // Read file contents securely
    $file = fopen($filename, 'r');
    if ($file) {
        $contents = fread($file, filesize($filename));
        fclose($file);
    } else {
        echo 'Error reading file';
        return false;
    }

    echo $contents;
    return true;
}

```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
        
            //read file into string
            $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
```
