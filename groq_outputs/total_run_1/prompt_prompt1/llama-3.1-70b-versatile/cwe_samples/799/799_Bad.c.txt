VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `getNextMessage` function is reading data into fixed-size buffers `username` and `password`, but there is no validation to ensure that the data received from the socket does not exceed the buffer sizes (`USERNAME_SIZE` and `PASSWORD_SIZE`). This could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. Additionally, the lack of null termination after reading the password and username buffers could also lead to an undefined behavior if these buffers are not null-terminated and are used later in the program.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of `getNextMessage` to ensure that the data received does not exceed the buffer sizes. If it does, handle the error accordingly (e.g., by returning an error code).
2. Use `snprintf` or a similar function to prevent buffer overflows when reading data into the `username` and `password` buffers.
3. Ensure that the buffers are null-terminated after reading data into them, for example, by manually setting the last character of the buffer to `\0` or using a function that guarantees null-termination.
4. Consider using dynamically allocated buffers or using functions like `getline` that handle buffer sizes and null-termination for you.
5. Validate and sanitize user input to prevent any potential security threats.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char username[USERNAME_SIZE];char password[PASSWORD_SIZE];
while (isValidUser == 0) {
    if (getNextMessage(socket, username, USERNAME_SIZE) > 0) {if (getNextMessage(socket, password, PASSWORD_SIZE) > 0) {isValidUser = AuthenticateUser(username, password);}}
}
return(SUCCESS);
