VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `removeScriptTags` method is vulnerable to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The method uses the `replaceAll` function with a user-controlled input ("script") as the regular expression pattern. The `replaceAll` function in Java uses a greedy matching approach, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when dealing with complex patterns or input. If an attacker carefully crafts an input, they can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

Additionally, the method does not validate or escape the `mask` parameter, which can lead to malicious content being injected into the output. This could potentially allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the output is included in a web page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Use a Whitelist approach: Instead of using `replaceAll` to replace "script" tags, it is better to use regular expressions that only match complete "script" tags (`<script>...</script>`) or other malicious JavaScript patterns. You can use a library such as OWASP's ESAPI or Apache Commons Lang to sanitize HTML input.

2.  Limit the input length: Limit the input length to prevent ReDoS attacks caused by excessively long inputs.

3.  Validate and escape the mask: Ensure the `mask` parameter is properly validated and escaped to prevent XSS attacks.

Here's an updated version of the method with these recommendations applied:

```java
private static final String SCRIPT_REGEX = "<script>.*?</script>";

public String removeScriptTags(String input) {
    return input.replaceAll(SCRIPT_REGEX, "", 100); // Limit the number of replacements
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String removeScriptTags(String input, String mask) {return input.replaceAll("script", mask);}
```
