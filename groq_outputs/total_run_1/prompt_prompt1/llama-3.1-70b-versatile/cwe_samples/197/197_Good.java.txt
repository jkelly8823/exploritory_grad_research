VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-8, 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains an integer overflow vulnerability, where untrusted data (amountSold) is converted to a short type and used in further calculations. This can lead to an unexpected behavior when the converted value exceeds the maximum limit of the short type, causing data integrity issues.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the amountSold parameter, which can be any integer value, is being converted to a short type. Although the code checks if the values are within the maximum limit of the short type before conversion, it does not handle potential errors properly. When an integer value exceeds the maximum limit of the short type, it will wrap around to its minimum limit, potentially leading to incorrect sales data. Moreover, the conversion does not consider potential negative values of amountSold.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:
1. Validate the amountSold parameter before using it in calculations to ensure it is within a reasonable range.
2. Consider using a try-catch block to handle potential ArithmeticException that may occur when integer values are out of range for the short type.
3. Change the type of the amountSold parameter to short from the beginning to prevent integer values from exceeding the maximum limit of the short type.
4. Re-evaluate the necessity of using short type for productCount and amountSold. If the range of values for these variables is too large to fit into a short type, consider using int or long type instead.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...
// update sales database for number of product sold with product ID
public void updateSalesForProduct(String productID, int amountSold) {
    
   // get the total number of products in inventory database
   int productCount = inventory.getProductCount(productID);
   // make sure that integer numbers are not greater than
   // maximum value for type short before converting
   
   if ((productCount < Short.MAX_VALUE) && (amountSold < Short.MAX_VALUE)) {
      
        // convert integer values to short, the method for the
        // sales object requires the parameters to be of type short
        short count = (short) productCount;short sold = (short) amountSold;
        // update sales database for product
        sales.updateSalesCount(productID, count, sold);
   }else {
       // throw exception or perform other processing
       ...
   }
