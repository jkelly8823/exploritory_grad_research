VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Session ID Length

EXPLANATION:
The `idLengthBytes` property is set to 8, which means the session ID is 8 bytes long. This is relatively short and can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. A session ID with a length of 8 bytes can be guessed or brute-forced, potentially allowing an attacker to hijack a user's session.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Increase the `idLengthBytes` value to a more secure length, such as 16 bytes or more. This will make the session ID more resistant to brute-force attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  `<sun-web-app>
      ...<session-config>
        <session-properties><property name="idLengthBytes" value="8"><description>The number of bytes in this web module's session ID.</description></property></session-properties>
      </session-config>...
  </sun-web-app>

Note: Other security considerations for session IDs include:

- Using a secure random number generator to generate the session ID
- Renewing the session ID regularly, such as on login or when a user's privilege level changes
- Validating and verifying the session ID on each request
- Using a secure protocol for transmitting the session ID, such as HTTPS
