VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Use of Unvalidated Native Code Loading

EXPLANATION: The native method System.loadLibrary loads the shared library "echo" without validation. This can potentially lead to vulnerabilities if the library is exploited or if a malicious library with the same name is loaded instead. This can result in arbitrary code execution or modification of the program's behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS: It is recommended to implement proper validation and sanitization for the library name before loading it. The Java system library can be checked if it can handle more than one .jar or .class files when added under dependency library’s directories or you can alternatively utilize the SecurityManager class to enforce specific security policies or checks for the program.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  class Echo {
                        
                           public native void runEcho();static {
                              
                                 System.loadLibrary("echo");
                           }public static void main(String[] args) {
                              
                                 new Echo().runEcho();
                           }
                     }
   This type of code can exploit the system in unexpected ways (and make the Echo native call untrusted).
