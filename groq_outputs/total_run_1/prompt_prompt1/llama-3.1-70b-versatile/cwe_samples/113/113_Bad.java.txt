VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unvalidated and unescaped user input being stored in a cookie.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to XSS because it directly assigns user input to a cookie without proper validation or sanitization. The `author` parameter is retrieved from the `request` object and then used to set the value of a cookie. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code, such as JavaScript, which can be executed when the cookie is accessed. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to steal sensitive data or perform malicious actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Validate and sanitize user input before storing it in a cookie.
2. Use a secure encoding scheme, such as URL encoding or base64 encoding, to prevent malicious code from being stored in the cookie.

Example of a secure implementation:
```java
String author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);
String encodedAuthor = URLEncoder.encode(author, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("author", encodedAuthor);
cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```
Additionally, consider using a cookie library that provides built-in security features and protection against XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("author", author);
cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```
