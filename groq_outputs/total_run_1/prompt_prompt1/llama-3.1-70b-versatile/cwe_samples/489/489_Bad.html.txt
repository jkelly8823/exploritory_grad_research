VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided HTML code contains a vulnerability related to insecure password handling. Specifically, the code does not specify a secure connection protocol for password authentication.


EXPLANATION:
Upon analysis, the form action attribute is pointing to a CGI script ("authenticate_login.cgi") that handles login authentication. However, the form does not use a secure protocol like HTTPS to encrypt the data exchanged between the client and the server. As a result, when a user submits their username and password, it is transmitted in plain text, potentially exposing the credentials to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to intercept and exploit sensitive user information.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend modifying the form action to use a secure connection protocol (HTTPS). Here's an updated version:


<FORM ACTION="https://example.com/authenticate_login.cgi" method="POST">
    <INPUT TYPE=TEXT name=username>
    <INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD name=password>
    <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
</FORM>

Additionally, we recommend setting the " secured" and "httponly" flags for any authentication cookies generated by the CGI script. Also, consider using a secure and up-to-date authentication protocol.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  <FORM ACTION="/authenticate_login.cgi"><INPUT TYPE=TEXT name=username><INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD name=password><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT></FORM>
