VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential NullPointerException and/or Unsolicited Data Exposure. The exception is caught and logged with sensitive information about the User object, potentially exposing this data in a place where it shouldn't be.

EXPLANATION:
The exception is caught and then logged along with "User.toString()". This can expose sensitive information about the user in log statements. This type of error might be seen by an attacker if they have physical access to the device or can intercept the logs remotely, potentially giving them valuable information about the users of the application. Furthermore, the exception message "Sorry, this application has experienced an error." might not be helpful to the user if an error actually occurs and an alternative method of error reporting would be beneficial. There is a possibility of a NullPointerException if the User object or User.toString() returns null.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a more targeted exception handling mechanism to handle different types of exceptions separately, reducing the chance of masking bugs.
- Avoid using "User.toString()" directly in error logs. Instead, handle it within a try-catch block, this ensures that even if User is null, it will not cause another exception.
- Look into logging the error on a remote server if logs can't be secured on the client side or add extra logs for customer to state what action was done before this exception.
- Create a method that returns the actual error message to avoid adding sensitive information into logs. Include stack traces only for certain types of errors.
- Limit knowledge given to the user when they encounter an error to disable the chance of the client knowing specifics.
