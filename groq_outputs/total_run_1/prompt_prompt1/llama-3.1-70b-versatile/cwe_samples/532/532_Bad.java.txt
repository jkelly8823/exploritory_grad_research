VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Log Injection attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly concatenates user input (`username` and `ccn`) into a logging statement using `logger.info`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious log messages that could be used to bypass logging mechanisms, forge entries, or potentially manipulate logs to cover tracks. This is considered insecure because it allows the logger to be used as a vector for malicious activity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent log injection attacks, avoid directly concatenating user input into log messages. Instead, use parameterized logging, where user input is passed separately from the log message format string. Many logging frameworks support parameterized logging. Here's an example:

```python
logger.info("Username: %s, CCN: %s", username, ccn)
```

Alternatively, you can use Python's f-strings or `.format()` method:

```python
logger.info(f"Username: {username}, CCN: {ccn}")
# or
logger.info("Username: {}, CCN: {}", username, ccn)
```

However, not all logging frameworks support parameterized logging with these methods. Make sure to check the documentation for your logging framework.

Additionally, you may want to consider sanitizing the input data before passing it to the logger.

ORIGINAL CODE:
logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);
