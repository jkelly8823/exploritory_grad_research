VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The provided code contains a vulnerability related to syntax ambiguity and implicit blocks. The semi-colon after the 'Do_X()' call is not a block delimiter and can lead to confusion.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, the condition 'condition==true' controls the execution of 'Do_X()'. However, since there is no explicit block defined for the 'if' statement and the use of parentheses is inconsistent, there's an assumption of implicit block. This semi-colon at the end of 'Do_X()' might terminate the 'if' statement prematurely and can lead to 'Do_Y()' being executed unconditionally, regardless of the condition. This could result in unintended behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, it is recommended to use proper block delimiters (curly brackets) for the 'if' condition and avoid the use of semi-colons as block delimiters. The corrected code should look like this:
```python
if (condition==true) {
    Do_X();
} 
Do_Y();
```
OR

```c
if (condition) {
    Do_X(); 
}
Do_Y();
```
Note that the corrected code snippet assumes a given programming language, and it's usually more idiomatic to write the if condition without == true.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
```
