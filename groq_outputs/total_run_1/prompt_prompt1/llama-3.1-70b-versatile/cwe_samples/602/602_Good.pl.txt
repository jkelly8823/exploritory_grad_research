VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Authentication credentials are stored in plain text, and input validation is not performed on the address provided by the user. Additionally, authentication credentials are sent over the network without proper encryption.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided demonstrates several security vulnerabilities. Firstly, it stores the username and password in plain text variables, which is insecure as an attacker with access to the code can easily obtain these credentials. Secondly, the code does not validate the address provided by the user, which could lead to potential issues such as injection attacks. Lastly, the code sends authentication credentials over the network without any encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.

Furthermore, line 7 has a syntax error. The `writeSocket($sock, "CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n";` statement is missing a closing parenthesis before the semicolon.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure and reliable method for storing and transmitting authentication credentials, such as hashing or encryption.
- Implement input validation on the address provided by the user to prevent potential injection attacks.
- Use a secure protocol such as SSL/TLS for encrypting the network traffic.
- Correct the syntax error in line 7 by adding the missing parenthesis.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
$server = "server.example.com";
$username = AskForUserName();
$password = AskForPassword();
$address = AskForAddress();
$sock = OpenSocket($server, 1234);
writeSocket($sock, "AUTH $username $password\n");
$resp = readSocket($sock);
if ($resp eq "success") {
  # username/pass is valid, go ahead and update the info!
  writeSocket($sock, "CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n";
} else {
  print "ERROR: Invalid Authentication!\n";
}
```

Example of secure code:
```perl
use IO::Socket::SSL;  # For secure connection

# ...

$server = "server.example.com";
$username = AskForUserName();
$password = AskForPassword();
$address = AskForAddress();
$sock = IO::Socket::SSL->new("$server:1234");

# Validate user input
if (!defined $username || !defined $address) {
  print "Error: Invalid user input!\n";
  exit;
}

# Send credentials over SSL/TLS
$sock->print("AUTH $username $password\n");
$resp = $sock->getline;

if ($resp eq "success\n") {
  # username/pass is valid, go ahead and update the info!
  $sock->print("CHANGE-ADDRESS $username $address\n");
} else {
  print "ERROR: Invalid Authentication!\n";
}
```
Note that in the example of secure code, we're using Perl's `IO::Socket::SSL` module to establish a secure connection. Also, we're validating the user input to prevent potential injection attacks.
