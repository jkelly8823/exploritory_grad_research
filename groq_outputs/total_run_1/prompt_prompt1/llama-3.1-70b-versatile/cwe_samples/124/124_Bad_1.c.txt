VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `strcpy` function is used to copy the contents of `srcBuf` to the location in `destBuf` starting at the index `idx`. However, the code does not perform any bounds checking to ensure that the source buffer (`srcBuf`) is not larger than the remaining space in the destination buffer (`destBuf`) from the `idx` position. If the source buffer is larger, the excess characters will be written beyond the boundaries of the destination buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, and crashes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a safer function that checks for buffer boundaries, such as `strncpy`. However, the example below shows how to use `strncpy` correctly and prevent an unintended null terminator truncation. 

```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;

    size_t remainingSpace = sizeof(destBuf) - idx; 
    size_t safeLen = (remainingSpace > strlen(srcBuf)) ? strlen(srcBuf) : remainingSpace - 1;
    strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, safeLen);
    destBuf[idx + safeLen] = '\0';
    ...
}
```

Additionally, consider checking the results of any function calls that involve buffer operations and ensuring that the destination buffer has enough space to hold the source buffer's contents.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
