VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a CWE-89 (SQL Injection) vulnerability, but due to a mismatch between the example provided and the code presented, the original intention seems to be avoiding SQL injection. However the current implementation presented leaves it vulnerable to a different attack. The 'runEmployeeQuery' function is called with a parameter from $_GET['EmployeeName'], which can contain untrusted input. Directly passing this user input to any other part of code that might execute a SQL query like concatenating a query string can provide a pathway for malicious input.


Although this example does not directly take a parameter from $_GET and execute a query on a database it still passes user input and makes the function runEmployeeQuery prone to potential information disclosure since it returns entire employee records and depending how others parts of the code executes the information the returned record may escalate severity due to misuse.


EXPLANATION:
This code is not directly using user input into an inline SQL query and seems to attempt a prepared statement with secure SQL practices for a variable name ($name). But other functionality with no clear scope does pass user input as an argument directly from an HTTP 'GET' request in a separate piece of code that does call the function runEmployeeQuery. This function returns entire employee records to non-related functionality within potentially different scope. However to a broader scope and impact if function runEmployeeQuery could misdirect part of the application this still could be seen under misuse thus ultimately lead directly to various aspects and elevate new classifications as being vulnerable. 


The usage of prepared statements is correct but insufficient details surrounding implementation due to missing scope and function overall requirements leaves the original code example still vulnerable to a various cross attack or unforeseen exposure from either misuse or unexpected error case.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation and sanitization on user input. 
   Ensure proper type-checking on parameters to ensure that a name passed does equal an actual employees name prior before executing an 'EmployeesRecord', if current table column specification must change the table specifications and existing database design.


2. Ensure that all functionalities' input parameters have a clear requirements and defined scope.

3. Ensure proper exception handling and error checking.

4. Never return data without filtering or evaluating their use within their destination parts, especially with entire db column records whose data might be critical like employee addresses.


ORIGINAL CODE:
function runEmployeeQuery($dbName, $name){mysql_select_db($dbName,$globalDbHandle) or die("Could not open Database".$dbName);
                        //Use a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89
                        $preparedStatement = $globalDbHandle->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');$preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name));return $preparedStatement->fetchAll();}
                     /.../
                     $employeeRecord = runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB',$_GET['EmployeeName']);
