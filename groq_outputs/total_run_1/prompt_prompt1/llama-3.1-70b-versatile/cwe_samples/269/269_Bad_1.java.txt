VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Switch Statement Vulnerability Due to Missing Enum Values
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided uses a switch statement based on an enum value. However, the switch statement only handles a default case and one specific value (GUEST). The other enum values (ADMIN and USER) are missing from the switch statement. This could lead to unexpected behavior when a request is made by a user with the ADMIN or USER role, as it will fall under the default case. In this instance, it appears that the code would still work as intended because it prints the current debug state for all non-GUEST users. However, if the code is intended to handle different roles differently or if the default case behavior changes, it could lead to security or functionality issues. Therefore, this can be considered a vulnerability due to the possibility of unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add cases to handle all enum values, including ADMIN and USER. If the behavior for these roles is the same as the default case, you can add them to the default case, or you can create separate cases for them.

```java
public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
  if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
    switch(requestingUser.role){
      case GUEST: System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command"); break;
      case ADMIN:
      case USER:
        System.out.println(currentDebugState()); break;
    }
  }else{
    System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use an if-else statement instead of a switch statement if the roles have different behaviors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public enum Roles {ADMIN,USER,GUEST}
public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
  if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
    switch(requestingUser.role){
      case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
      default:System.out.println(currentDebugState());break;
    }
  }else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
}
```
