VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The os.mkdir() function is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. This is because the 'username' parameter is concatenated with the hardcoded path '/home/' without proper sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to create a new directory for a user using the os.mkdir() function. However, the 'username' parameter is not properly sanitized before being concatenated with the hardcoded path '/home/'. An attacker could potentially inject directory traversal sequences (such as '../') into the 'username' parameter, allowing them to create directories outside of the intended '/home/' directory. This is a classic example of a path traversal attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the 'username' parameter should be properly sanitized before being used to create the directory. This can be achieved by using the os.path.join() function to join the '/home/' path with the 'username', and then using the os.path.normpath() function to normalize the resulting path. This will prevent directory traversal sequences from being injected into the path. Additionally, the code should validate the 'username' parameter to ensure it only contains allowed characters.

Here is an example of how the code can be fixed:
```python
import os

def makeNewUserDir(username):
    # Validate the username
    if invalidUsername(username):
        print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')
        return False

    try:
        # Sanitize the username and create the directory
        user_dir_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join('/home/', username))
        raisePrivileges()
        os.mkdir(user_dir_path)
        lowerPrivileges()
    except OSError:
        print('Unable to create new user directory for user: ' + username)
        return False
    return True
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def makeNewUserDir(username):
    if invalidUsername(username):
        # avoid CWE-22 and CWE-78
        print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')
        return False

    try:raisePrivileges()os.mkdir('/home/' + username)lowerPrivileges()
    except OSError:print('Unable to create new user directory for user:' + username)return False
    return True
```
