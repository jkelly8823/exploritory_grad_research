VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided Perl code is vulnerable to a Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack due to the use of overly permissive backtracking in the regular expression. Specifically, the pattern `(\w+\s?)*` causes the regex engine to backtrack excessively when dealing with certain inputs, potentially leading to significant performance issues or even crashes.

This is because the regular expression contains a repeated capturing group (`(\w+\s?)*`) with an optional quantifier (`\s?`). When the engine encounters an input that doesn't match the pattern, it will go back and try different matches for the repeated group, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of backtracking steps.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this issue, consider modifying the regular expression to avoid excessive backtracking. Here are some suggested changes:

1. Use a more specific and efficient regular expression pattern. For example, if you're only interested in matching word characters and spaces, you could use `\b\w+\b\s*` to match one or more word characters bounded by word boundaries and followed by zero or more spaces.

2. Consider using a possessive quantifier (e.g., `(\w+)*+` instead of `(\w+)*`) to prevent backtracking once a match is found.

3. If possible, use an alternative approach to validation that doesn't rely on regular expressions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $bdrslt = $test_string;
$bdrslt =~ /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
