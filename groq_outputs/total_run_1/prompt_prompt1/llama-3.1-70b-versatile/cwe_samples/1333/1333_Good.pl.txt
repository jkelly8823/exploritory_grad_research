VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regression of DOS (Denial of Service) due to catastrophic backtracking in regular expressions.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a regular expression that may cause catastrophic backtracking, a type of denial-of-service (DOS) vulnerability. The regular expression `/^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i` contains nested repetition (`*`) operators. If the input string does not match the pattern, this can cause the regex engine to perform an exponential number of backtracks, leading to a significant performance degradation or even a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent catastrophic backtracking, we should avoid the use of nested repetition operators and ensure that our regular expressions are matching the expected input format. Here's a more efficient and safer version:

```perl
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $gdrslt = $test_string;
$gdrslt =~ /^\w+$/i;
```
In this modified code, the regular expression `/^\w+$/i` simply matches any word characters from the beginning to the end of the string, preventing the catastrophic backtracking.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $gdrslt = $test_string;
$gdrslt =~ /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
```
