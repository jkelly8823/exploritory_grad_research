VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code segment is vulnerable to an Unauthenticated Information Disclosure and Potential Server Status Disclosure.

EXPLANATION:
The code appears to check the IP address of the requesting user against an allowed IP list. If the IP is not in the list, it displays an "unauthorized" message and redirects the user to an error page. However, after this check, it calls the `getServerStatus` function and directly outputs the server status, regardless of the user's IP. This could potentially disclose sensitive information about the server. Furthermore, this code does not properly handle or validate user input, making it vulnerable to potential attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this issue, you should validate the user's access before disclosing sensitive information about the server. Also, user input should be validated and sanitized to prevent potential attacks.

Here's an example of how to modify the code to address this vulnerability:

```
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if(in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)) {
    $status = getServerStatus();
    echo $status;
} else {
    echo "You are not authorized to view this page";
    http_redirect($errorPageURL);
    exit;
}
```

Note that this is a simplified example and your actual solution may vary based on your specific use case and requirements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
```
