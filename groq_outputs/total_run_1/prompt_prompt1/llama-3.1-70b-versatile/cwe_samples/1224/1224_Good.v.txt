VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 29-31
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential data exposure due to an incomplete data reset when the `ip_resetn` signal is asserted.

EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the code, I found that when `ip_resetn` is asserted (i.e., in reset state), the `Data_out` is reset to `16'h0000`, which is a 16-bit zero value. However, this reset only occurs when `ip_resetn` goes low (negedge). When `ip_resetn` is already low and the module is powered up or comes out of reset, the initial value of `Data_out` is not explicitly defined. This can lead to a situation where `Data_out` retains its previous value, potentially exposing sensitive data.

Furthermore, even when `ip_resetn` is asserted, the `Data_out[15:1]` bits are not explicitly reset to zero in all cases. In the third `else if (~write)` condition, `Data_out[15:1]` is left unchanged, which means it may retain its previous value when `write` is low.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to explicitly reset all bits of `Data_out` when `ip_resetn` is asserted. Additionally, ensure that all bits of `Data_out` are properly initialized when the module is powered up or comes out of reset. Here's an example of how to modify the code to address this vulnerability:

```verilog
always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip_resetn)
  if (~ip_resetn) begin
    Data_out <= 16'h0000;
    Write_once_status <= 1'b0;
  end
  ...
```

In the third `else if (~write)` condition, explicitly reset `Data_out[15:1]` to zero:

```verilog
else if (~write) begin
  Data_out <= {16{1'b0}};
  Data_out[0] <= Write_once_status;
end
```

By making these changes, you can ensure that all bits of `Data_out` are properly reset when `ip_resetn` is asserted and that no sensitive data is exposed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
module register_write_once_example ( 
  input [15:0] Data_in, 
  input Clk, 
  input ip_resetn, 
  input global_resetn, 
  input write, 
  output reg [15:0] Data_out 
); 
      
reg Write_once_status; 
          
always @(posedge Clk or negedge ip_resetn) 
  
  if (~ip_resetn) 
  begin 
  
    Data_out <= 16'h0000; 
    Write_once_status <= 1'b0; 
  
  end 
  else if (write & ~Write_once_status) 
  begin 
  
    Data_out <= Data_in & 16'hFFFE; 
    Write_once_status <= 1'b1; // Write once status set on first write, independent of input 
  
  end 
  else if (~write) 
  begin 
  
    Data_out[15:1] <= Data_out[15:1]; 
    Data_out[0] <= Write_once_status; 
  
  end 
  
endmodule
```
