VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Plain text storage of sensitive data

EXPLANATION:
This piece of code declares a private character array (char*) named "password" which is likely used to store a user's password. However, in its current form, it implies that the password is being stored in plain text. This is a security risk as an attacker gaining access to the memory or database could read the passwords directly. Furthermore, using a plain char* for storing sensitive data does not provide any additional security controls.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

- Use a secure string class or library for storing sensitive data such as passwords. This type of data should be hashed or encrypted before storing and should never be stored in plain text.
- Store the hashed or encrypted result instead of the actual password.
- If feasible, use an existing library or framework for handling passwords securely.
- Hash passwords with a strong hashing algorithm such as bcrypt.

ORIGINAL CODE:
private: char* password;
