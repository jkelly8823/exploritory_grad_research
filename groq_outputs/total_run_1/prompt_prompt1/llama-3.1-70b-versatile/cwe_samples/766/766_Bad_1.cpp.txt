VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow and Logic Bug

EXPLANATION:
The UserAccount class is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. The strcpy function does not perform any bounds checking on the input strings, which can cause a buffer overflow if the input strings are longer than MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH and MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH. 

Additionally, in the authorizeAccess function, the if statement is incorrectly evaluating the return value of strcmp. The strcmp function returns 0 if the strings are equal and a non-zero value if they are not equal. Therefore, the current implementation will only authorize access if the usernames and passwords do not match.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace strcpy with strncpy to prevent buffer overflow. The strncpy function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing a buffer overflow. 

2. Change the implementation of the authorizeAccess function to correctly evaluate the return value of strcmp. The function should authorize access if the return value of strcmp is 0, indicating that the strings are equal.

3. Change the lines 8 and 10 to check for NULL pointers and length before making copies of the username and password. This can be done using strlen and comparing the result with the max length before making a copy.

4. Remove magic numbers and replace them with constants or configurable variables.

5. Avoid using ExitError as it's not a function that seems to be defined anywhere in the code. Consider throwing an exception instead.

6. Consider using more secure methods for storing passwords such as hashing and salting.

ORIGINAL CODE:


#define MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH 15
#define MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH 15

class UserAccount{
public:
    UserAccount(char *username, char *password){
        if ((strlen(username) > MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH) || (strlen(password) > MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH)) {
            ExitError("Invalid username or password");
        }
        strcpy(this->username, username);
        strcpy(this->password, password);
    }

    int authorizeAccess(char *username, char *password){
        if ((strlen(username) > MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH) || (strlen(password) > MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH)) {
            ExitError("Invalid username or password");}
        if (strcmp(this->username, username) || strcmp(this->password, password))
            return 0;

        else
            return 1;

    }

    char username[MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH+1];
    char password[MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH+1];
};
