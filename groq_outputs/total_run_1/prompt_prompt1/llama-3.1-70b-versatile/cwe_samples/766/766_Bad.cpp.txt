VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Plain Text Password Storage

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment indicates that the application stores passwords as plain text, which is a serious security vulnerability. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive user credentials, leading to unauthorized access and identity theft. Storing passwords in plain text makes it easier for attackers to obtain and exploit them if the database or storage is compromised.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure hashing algorithm to store passwords: Instead of storing passwords as plain text, consider using a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2 to hash and store passwords.
2. Use a secure password storage library: Consider using a reputable library or framework to handle password storage, such as OpenSSL or a dedicated password hashing library.
