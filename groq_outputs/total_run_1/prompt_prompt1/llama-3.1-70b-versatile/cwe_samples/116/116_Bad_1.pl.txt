VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes an untrusted input string (`$inputString`) and parses it into a command and an argument. However, it does not validate or sanitize the input before passing it to the file server. Specifically, the code uses the `$cmd` and `$argstr` variables to construct a new command string that is sent to the file server. If an attacker can inject malicious input into the `GetUntrustedArgument("command")` function, they may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the file server.

Additionally, the use of the `UrlEncode` function on the `$argstr` variable does not provide adequate protection against command injection, as it is designed to encode URLs, not command arguments.

The lines 3-4 and 11 are vulnerable, as they use the `$cmd` and `$argstr` variables to construct the command string sent to the file server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following:

* Use input validation and sanitization to ensure that the input string only contains allowed characters and commands.
* Use a whitelist approach to validate the `$cmd` variable against a list of allowed commands.
* Use parameterized commands or prepared statements instead of constructing command strings manually.
* Avoid using `UrlEncode` on command arguments, instead use a library or function designed specifically for command argument escaping.

ORIGINAL CODE:

$inputString = GetUntrustedArgument("command");($cmd, $argstr) = split(/\s+/, $inputString, 2);
# removes extra whitespace and also changes CRLF's to spaces
$argstr =~ s/\s+/ /gs;
$argstr = UrlEncode($argstr);if (($cmd eq "BAN") && (! IsAdministrator($username))) {die "Error: you are not the admin.\n";}
# communicate with file server using a file handle
$fh = GetServerFileHandle("myserver");
print $fh "$cmd $argstr\n";
