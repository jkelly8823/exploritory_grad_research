VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, specifically a Stack-based Buffer Overflow (SBO) due to the use of an unbounded input function `scanf()` with the `%s` format specifier.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `scanf()` with the `%s` format specifier to read a string into the `last_name` array. This format specifier does not perform any bounds checking on the input, which means that if the user enters a string longer than the allocated space for `last_name`, it will overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent variables on the stack. This can lead to undefined behavior, including code injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using `fgets()` instead of `scanf()` to read input from the user. `fgets()` allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read, preventing buffer overflows. Alternatively, you can use `scanf()` with the `%20s` format specifier to specify a maximum input length of 20 characters.

```c
// Using fgets()
char last_name[20];
printf("Enter your last name: ");
fgets(last_name, sizeof(last_name), stdin);

// Using scanf() with bounded input
char last_name[20];
printf("Enter your last name: ");
scanf("%20s", last_name);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char last_name[20];
printf ("Enter your last name: ");
scanf ("%s", last_name);
```
