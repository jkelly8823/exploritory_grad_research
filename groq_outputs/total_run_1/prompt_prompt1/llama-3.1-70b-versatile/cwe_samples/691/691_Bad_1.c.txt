VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Implicit Semicolon, and Implicit Block in a Conditional Statement

EXPLANATION:
The code segment `if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();` contains a potential vulnerability due to implicit semicolons and implicit blocks in a conditional statement. The issue arises when the condition is false. In this scenario, both `Do_X()` and `Do_Y()` will be executed regardless of the condition, because there is no explicit block around `Do_Y()`. The implicit semicolon after the conditional statement does not provide any block scope for `Do_Y()`. This will likely lead to unintended behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the issue, use explicit blocks to define the scope of the conditional statement. Remove unnecessary parentheses around the condition.

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    Do_X();
    Do_Y(); // if Do_Y should also be conditional
}
```
Alternatively, if `Do_Y()` should not be conditional, use proper code formatting and comments to reflect this.

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    Do_X(); // executes only when condition is true
}
Do_Y(); // executes regardless of condition
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
