VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `system` function in the given code is used to execute a shell command with the `$phone` variable. However, the input validation for the `$phone` variable is insufficient. Even though the code checks if the `$phone` variable only contains hyphens and digits, this validation can be bypassed to inject arbitrary shell commands. An attacker could craft a malicious phone number that would execute additional shell commands on the system. This can be done by adding shell meta-characters such as `;`, `|`, or `&` to the input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when executing shell commands to prevent command injection.
2.  Use a whitelist-based input validation approach to ensure that the input conforms to the expected format.
3.  Consider using a safer alternative to the `system` function, such as `exec` or `fork/exec`, to reduce the attack surface.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
$phone = GetPhoneNumber();if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
    # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
    system("lookup-phone $phone");}
else {error("malformed number!");}
```

Example of secure code:

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use IPC::System::Simple 'systemx';

$phone = GetPhoneNumber();
if ($phone =~ /^\d+-\d+$/) {
    # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
    systemx("lookup-phone", $phone);
} else {
    error("malformed number!");
}
```
