VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Information Disclosure. The code checks for a debug flag, and if enabled, it displays the user account number on the page. This can potentially reveal sensitive information to an attacker.

EXPLANATION:
The debug flag 'debugEnabled' is being checked, and based on this flag, sensitive user information is being displayed on the page. This is a potential security risk as an attacker could manipulate the debug flag or find a way to enable it, resulting in sensitive information being exposed. Additionally, even if the debug flag is disabled by default, an attacker may still attempt to bypass or brute-force the flag to reveal sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
- Avoid displaying sensitive information in debug or production environments.
- Use a secure method for debugging, such as logging or error reporting, which does not display sensitive information to users.
- Ensure that sensitive information, such as user account numbers, is properly protected and not displayed unnecessarily.
- Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
    %>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
```
