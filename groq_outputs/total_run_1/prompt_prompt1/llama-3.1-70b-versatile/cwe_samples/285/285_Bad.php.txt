VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated user input is used in a database query, leading to a potential SQL injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes user input from the `$_GET['EmployeeName']` superglobal and passes it directly to the `runEmployeeQuery` function without any validation or sanitization. Although a prepared statement is used, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection, the input is not properly validated. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even possible SQL injection attacks.

In the `runEmployeeQuery` function, the use of a prepared statement with parameterized queries helps to prevent direct SQL injection. However, the input from `$_GET['EmployeeName']` is still not validated and may lead to issues such as SQL errors or unexpected results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input: Use a validation function or regular expression to ensure that the input from `$_GET['EmployeeName']` conforms to expected patterns (e.g., alphanumeric characters, maximum length).
2. Sanitize user input: Use a PHP filter or sanitization function to remove any potentially malicious characters from the input.
3. Use a whitelist approach: Only allow specific values or patterns in the `$_GET['EmployeeName']` input.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function runEmployeeQuery($dbName, $name){
    mysql_select_db($dbName,$globalDbHandle) or die("Could not open Database".$dbName);
    //Use a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89
    $preparedStatement = $globalDbHandle->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');
    $preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name));
    return $preparedStatement->fetchAll();
}
 
$employeeRecord = runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB',$_GET['EmployeeName']);
```
