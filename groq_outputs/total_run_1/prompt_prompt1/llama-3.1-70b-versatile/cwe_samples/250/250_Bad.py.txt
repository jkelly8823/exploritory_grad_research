VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability and Lack of Input Validation.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it directly concatenates the username with a path without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to create a directory outside of the intended directory tree by manipulating the username. 

Additionally, although there is a check for invalid usernames, the definition of "invalid" is not provided in this code snippet. If the check does not properly validate the input, the code may still be vulnerable to attacks.

Furthermore, the function `raisePrivileges()` and `lowerPrivileges()` are not provided in this code snippet, but based on their names, they may introduce additional vulnerabilities if not correctly implemented.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Always use a secure method to construct file paths. In this case, you should use the `os.path.join` function instead of direct string concatenation.
- Implement proper input validation and error handling for the `invalidUsername` function.
- Avoid using `try-except` blocks to catch broad exceptions like `OSError`. Instead, catch specific exceptions that you can handle.
- Validate the username against a whitelist of allowed characters before attempting to create the directory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def makeNewUserDir(username):
    if invalidUsername(username):
        #avoid CWE-22 and CWE-78
        print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')
        return False
    try:
        raisePrivileges()
        os.mkdir('/home/' + username)
        lowerPrivileges()
    except OSError:
        print('Unable to create new user directory for user:' + username)
    return False
    return True
```
