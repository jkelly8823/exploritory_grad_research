VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. The function GetUntrustedInput() retrieves input from an untrusted source, which is then used to construct a filename without proper validation or sanitization. Although the code attempts to prevent access to parent directories with the line `$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;`, this is not sufficient to prevent a Path Traversal attack.

An attacker could still traverse directories using Unicode characters, double encoding, or other encoding techniques that the simple removal of "../" does not prevent. This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the input to prevent Path Traversal attacks. Here are some recommended fixes:

1. Validate the input:
   - Check if the input contains any directory traversal sequences.
   - Use a whitelist approach to only allow valid characters in the input.

2. Use a more secure method to construct the filename:
   - Use a secure method to construct the filename that prevents directory traversal.

3. Sanitize the input:
   - Normalize the input to prevent double encoding attacks.

Here's an example of how you can implement these fixes:

```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();

# Normalize the input
$Username =~ s/\.\.//g;

# Validate the input
if ($Username !~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/) {
    # Handle invalid input
}

my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;

# Use a secure method to construct the filename
my $real_filename = realpath($filename);

# Check if the file is within the expected directory
if ($real_filename !~ /^\/home\/user\/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/) {
    # Handle invalid input
}

ReadAndSendFile($real_filename);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput(); $Username =~ s/\.\.\///; my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username; ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
