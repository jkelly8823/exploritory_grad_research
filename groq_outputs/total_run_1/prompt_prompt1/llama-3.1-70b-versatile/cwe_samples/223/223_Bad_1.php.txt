VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and File Inclusion Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code contains a path traversal vulnerability, which could be used by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. This vulnerability occurs because the `$realFile` variable, which is used to store the resolved path of the file, is not validated or sanitized.

The vulnerability is present in lines 4 and 5, where the code is trying to resolve symbolic links. However, if the file is not a symbolic link, the `readlink()` function is not called, and the original path is used. If the original path is a symbolic link, or if it contains a path traversal sequence such as `../../`, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files.

Additionally, the code does not have any checks to prevent directory traversal attacks. If an attacker can inject a string containing a directory traversal sequence into the `$filename` variable, they could potentially access files outside of the intended directory.

The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that the `fileowner()` function is used to check ownership, which may not prevent attacks if the file has open permissions for other users or groups.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `$filename` variable to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Use `realpath()` instead of `readlink()` to prevent symbolic link attacks.
3. Use `basename()` function to prevent directory traversal attacks.
4. Consider using a whitelist of allowed files and directories to access.
5. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
6. Use more restrictive file permissions to limit the attack surface.

Here is an example of how the function can be modified to address these vulnerabilities:

```php
function readFile($filename) {
    $user = getCurrentUser();
    $realFile = realpath($filename);
    if ($realFile !== realpath(dirname($filename)) . '/' . $realFile) {
        // This means the $realFile is outside of the directory we expect
        echo 'Access denied';
        writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));
        return;
    }
    if (fileowner($realFile) == $user) {
        if (is_readable($realFile)) {
            echo file_get_contents($realFile);
        } else {
            echo 'Access denied';
            writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));
        }
    } else {
        echo 'Access denied';
        writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));
    }
}

// ORIGINAL CODE:
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();
    $realFile = $filename;
    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
}
```
