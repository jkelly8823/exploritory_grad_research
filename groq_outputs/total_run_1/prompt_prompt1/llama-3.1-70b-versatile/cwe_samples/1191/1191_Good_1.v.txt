VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow/Information Exposure via Unchecked Data Copy.

EXPLANATION:
The assignment of `data_d` to `pass_data` without proper bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow or information exposure vulnerability. This occurs because `pass_data` is also a 512-bit vector. However, no input validation or length checks are performed on `data_d` before it is copied to `pass_data`, which could potentially cause an out-of-bounds write.

However, given the information that both `pass_data` and `data_d` are 512-bit vectors, a more pressing concern here could be that the system does not prevent the disclosure of sensitive data by copying it into another variable (`pass_data`) in an unsecured manner.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this issue, always perform input validation and bounds checking before copying sensitive data to another location. Ensure that both the source and destination buffers are of the correct size, and perform a length check to prevent information exposure. 

Consider implementing proper security protocols for handling sensitive data. It is also crucial that mechanisms are put in place to ensure data confidentiality and integrity throughout the system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
logic [512-1:0] data_d, data_q;
...
logic [512-1:0] pass_data;
...
    Write: begin
        
        ...
        
        if (pass_mode) begin
            
            pass_data = data_d;
            state_d = PassChk;
            pass_mode = 1'b0;
        
        ...
        
    end
