VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to the insecure retrieval of sensitive data, specifically the keystore password, from system properties.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code retrieves the keystore password from system properties using the `System.getProperty()` method. However, this approach can be insecure as system properties can be accessed by other processes and users on the system, potentially exposing the sensitive password. Furthermore, this approach does not provide any protection against accidental exposure of the password through logging or debugging.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of retrieving sensitive data from system properties, consider using a more secure approach such as:

* Using environment variables with the appropriate permissions and access controls.
* Using a secure configuration file with proper encryption and access controls.
* Using a secrets management solution to securely store and retrieve sensitive data.

Additionally, it is recommended to handle sensitive data with more care, such as using a char array instead of a String to store the password, and clearing the data as soon as it is no longer needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String keystorePass = System.getProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword");
if (keystorePass == null) {
    System.err.println("ERROR: Keystore password not specified.");
    System.exit(-1);
}
```
Note that the ... in the original code is assumed to be a placeholder for additional code, and is not evaluated as part of this analysis.
