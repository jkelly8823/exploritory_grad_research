VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unvalidated Data Copy in a Finite State Machine (FSM) Transition

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the code where `pass_data` is directly assigned the value of `data_d` without any validation or sanitization. This is a potential security vulnerability, especially in a Finite State Machine (FSM) transition, as it can lead to unintended behavior or even data corruption. In this context, `pass_data` is being assigned the value of `data_d` when the `pass_mode` is enabled, and then immediately transitioning to the `PassChk` state. This lack of validation or boundaries checking on the `pass_data` variable can lead to potential vulnerabilities, especially if the data is used later in the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, validate the `data_d` value before assigning it to `pass_data`. This validation can be as simple as checking for known good data bounds or more complex, such as using a checksum or encryption. Additionally, consider adding a sanity check to the `pass_data` value before using it later in the code.

Consider the following code modifications to address this vulnerability:

```verilog
if (pass_mode) begin
    if (data_d == expected_data || validate_data(data_d)) begin
        pass_data = data_d;
        state_d = PassChk;
        pass_mode = 1'b0;
    end else begin
        // Handle the error or unexpected data scenario
    end
end
```

In this modified code, `expected_data` is a pre-defined known good value or a function call `validate_data(data_d)` that checks the `data_d` value for correctness.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
logic [512-1:0] data_d, data_q
logic [512-1:0] pass_data;
...
        
Write: begin
    ...
        
    if (pass_mode) begin
        pass_data = data_d;
        state_d = PassChk;
        pass_mode = 1'b0;
        ...
        
    end
end
...
```
