VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code uses a weak hashing algorithm, SHA, for password storage. Further, the code invokes a non-existent method 'password.digest()' which should be 'encer.digest()'. It is also hashing the wrong string (it seems it should be hashing the combined plain text and a secret, rather than a possibly provided password in 'secret_password()').

EXPLANATION:
In this code, we see the use of SHA as a hashing algorithm for password storage. SHA is a weak hashing algorithm that can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Furthermore, a hash function like SHA is meant to be fast to compute, which makes it easier for attackers to brute-force passwords. A stronger hashing algorithm, such as PBKDF2, or Argon2 would be more suitable for password storage.

The variable 'password' in 'password.digest()' is non-existent and should be 'encer' which is the instance of 'MessageDigest'.

Additionally, we can see that the code seems to be trying to hash only the provided plain text, rather than a combination of the provided text and the secret password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Switch from SHA to PBKDF2 or Argon2, or a similar strong hashing algorithm.
2. Correct the code by using 'encer' instead of 'password' in 'encer.digest()'.
3. Combine the provided text with the secret password before hashing.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");encer.update(plainTextIn);byte[] digest = password.digest();//Login if hash matches stored hashif (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
