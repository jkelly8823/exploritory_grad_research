VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential information leak due to unencrypted or unhashed sensitive data being written to 'pass_data'.

EXPLANATION:
The code assigns 'data_d' to 'pass_data' without performing any encryption or hashing operations on the sensitive data. This could potentially expose the data if 'pass_data' is being transmitted or stored insecurely. The use of concatenation with zeros might indicate an attempt to pad the data, but it does not provide any meaningful protection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider implementing encryption or hashing operations on 'data_d' before assigning it to 'pass_data'. This will help protect the sensitive data from unauthorized access. Additionally, ensure that 'pass_data' is properly secured when transmitted or stored.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
...
logic [31:0] data_d, data_q
logic [512-1:0] pass_data;
...
    
    Write: begin
       
       ...
          
       if (pass_mode) begin
          pass_data = { {60{8'h00}}, data_d};
          state_d = PassChk;
          pass_mode = 1'b0;
          
       ...
       
    end
...
