VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks from a proxy server using the 'X-Forwarded-For' header. 

EXPLANATION:
The code checks for the presence of the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header in the server variables. However, the logic is flawed; if this header is present, it aborts and does not use it to obtain the client's actual IP address. In its place, it attempts to obtain the client's actual IP by using the 'REMOTE_ADDR' key of the server variables. 

However, this logic fails to consider a key factor. 'X-Forwarded-For' is a header typically used by proxy servers to indicate the actual client's IP address. If this header is present, the code should use its value to obtain the client's IP address instead of simply removing it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of merely aborting when it detects the 'X-Forwarded-For' header, the code should leverage it to obtain the actual IP address. This would involve parsing the 'X-Forwarded-For' header and then using its value instead of the value contained within 'REMOTE_ADDR'. However, to protect from IP spoofing, additional validation should be performed to detect whether or not the IP within 'X-Forwarded-For' actually corresponds to the source IP (e.g., by verifying that the client IP matches an IP range specified as valid). Only utilize the provided value if client and proxy details match your accept and valid proxy range IP addresses.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$requestingIP = '0.0.0.0';if (array_key_exists('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER)) {echo "This application cannot be accessed through a proxy.";return;
else{$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];}
