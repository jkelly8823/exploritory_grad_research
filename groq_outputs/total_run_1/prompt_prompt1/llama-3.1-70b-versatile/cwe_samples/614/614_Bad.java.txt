VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Session Management - Sensitive Data Exposure via Cookies

EXPLANATION:
The provided code sets a cookie named 'ACCOUNT_ID' with the value of 'acctID'. However, there is no indication that this cookie is being flagged as secure or HTTP-only. As a result, an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to steal or tamper with the account ID cookie. Secure cookies should be set with the 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags to mitigate the risk of cookie tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, set the 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags on the cookie to prevent tampering and ensure the cookie is transmitted securely.

```java
Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID);
c.setSecure(true);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
response.addCookie(c);
```

Additionally, consider using a secure communication protocol (HTTPS) to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID);response.addCookie(c);
```
