VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains duplicate form names within a single formset.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, there are two HTML forms with the same name attribute ("ProjectForm") within the same formset. This can lead to a vulnerability as it may cause unexpected behavior or errors when forms are submitted or validated. Duplicate names can cause issues with JavaScript or backend code that relies on unique form names, potentially leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to rename one or both of the forms to have unique names. This will prevent any potential issues with form submission, validation, or JavaScript code that interacts with the forms.

Here is an example of the corrected code:

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm_1"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm_2"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```

Note that the exact fix may vary depending on the specific requirements of the application. However, ensuring that form names are unique within the formset is essential to prevent potential issues.
