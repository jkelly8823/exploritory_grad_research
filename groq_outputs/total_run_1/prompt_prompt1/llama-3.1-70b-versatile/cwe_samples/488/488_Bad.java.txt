VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated and Unsanitized User Input, Missing Validation and Sanitization, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code contains a serious security vulnerability. It uses user-supplied input (`req.getParameter("name")`) directly in the output (`out.println(name + ", thanks for visiting!");`), without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the HTML output of the page, potentially leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `getParameter("name")` method can return any value submitted by the user in the "name" parameter of the request. An attacker can submit malicious code, such as JavaScript, which can be executed by the client's browser when the page is loaded. This could lead to a range of attacks, including the theft of user credentials or session information, defacement of the site, or spreading malware.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should:

1.  Validate user-supplied input. This can involve checking that the input matches a specific pattern or format. For example, if you only expect the "name" parameter to contain letters and spaces, you can enforce this using a regular expression.

2.  Sanitize user-supplied input to prevent any potential malicious code from being executed. This often involves removing or replacing special characters, or encoding the input so that it is not executed as code.

Here's an example of how you can validate and sanitize the input:

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) {
    String name = req.getParameter("name");

    // Basic validation and sanitization
    if (name != null) {
        name = name.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z ]", "").trim();
        if (!name.isEmpty()) {
            out.println(name + ", thanks for visiting!");
        } else {
            out.println("Invalid name");
        }
    }
}
```

Note that this is a basic example and the exact implementation of validation and sanitization will depend on your specific requirements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class GuestBook extends HttpServlet {
    String name;

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) {
        name = req.getParameter("name");
        ...out.println(name + ", thanks for visiting!");
    }
}
```
