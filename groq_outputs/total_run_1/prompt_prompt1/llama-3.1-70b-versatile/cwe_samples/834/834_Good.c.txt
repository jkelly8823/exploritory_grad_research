VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Infinite Recursion Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code contains a function `do_something_recursive` that calls itself recursively until the condition `flg` becomes 0. However, within the recursive call, the value of `flg` is not modified. This can lead to an infinite recursion if the condition `flg` never changes.

In the given code snippet, the function calls itself with the same value of `flg` in the recursive call. This can cause the function to call itself indefinitely, potentially leading to a stack overflow error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the condition that controls recursion will eventually be met. Here are some recommended fixes:

1. Update the condition variable within the recursive function: Modify the recursive call to update the value of `flg` so that it will eventually become 0 and stop the recursion.

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    if (flg > 0) { 
        // Do some work here
        do_something_recursive (flg - 1); // decrement flg
    }
}
```

2. Check for recursion depth limits: Implement a mechanism to limit the depth of recursion. This can prevent the function from calling itself indefinitely.

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg, int depth)
{
    if (depth >= MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH) {
        // Handle recursion depth limit error
    }
    if (flg > 0) { 
        // Do some work here
        do_something_recursive (flg - 1, depth + 1); // increment depth
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    // ... Do some real work here
    // Modify value of flg on done condition
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // returns when flg changes to 0
}

int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
