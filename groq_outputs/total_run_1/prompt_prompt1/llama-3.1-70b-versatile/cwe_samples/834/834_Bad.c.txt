VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite recursion vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code has an infinite recursion vulnerability because the value of the "flg" parameter in the "do_something_recursive" function is never modified within the function. As a result, when the "flg" value is set to a non-zero value, the recursive call to "do_something_recursive" will continue indefinitely. This can cause the program to consume all available stack space, resulting in a stack overflow error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add a base case that modifies the value of "flg" to eventually break the recursion. For example, if the recursion is used for iteration, you can use a counter to limit the number of recursive calls. Alternatively, you can refactor the code to use a loop instead of recursion.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```

Example of fixed code:

```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg, int counter)
{
    if (counter == 0) { return; } // Base case to break recursion
    // Do some real work here
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg, counter - 1); } // Recursive call with modified counter
}

int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
int max_iterations = 100;
do_something_recursive (flag, max_iterations);
```
