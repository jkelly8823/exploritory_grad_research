VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory allocation vulnerability due to potential integer overflow and lack of null pointer checking.

EXPLANATION:
The code multiplies the number of images (`num_imgs`) by the size of each image (`sizeof(img_t)`) to calculate the total memory required for the `table_ptr` allocation. However, if `num_imgs` is large, this multiplication can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller than expected allocation. This can lead to a buffer overflow when data is written to the allocated memory.

Additionally, the code does not check if the `malloc` call returns a null pointer, which indicates that the allocation failed. If the allocation fails, the program will likely crash or exhibit undefined behavior when trying to access or write to the allocated memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities:

1.  Check the result of the `malloc` call to handle allocation failures:

    ```c
table_ptr = malloc(sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs);
if (table_ptr == NULL) {
    // Handle allocation failure, e.g., exit the program or return an error
}
```

2.  Consider using a safer data type to store the number of images, such as `size_t`, to reduce the likelihood of integer overflow.

3.  Verify that `num_imgs` is positive and within a reasonable range to prevent potential arithmetic overflows. You can also use `size_t` casting to prevent negative values.

4.  Consider using `calloc` instead of `malloc` to initialize the memory with zeros, which can help prevent data corruption and uninitialized variable vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
