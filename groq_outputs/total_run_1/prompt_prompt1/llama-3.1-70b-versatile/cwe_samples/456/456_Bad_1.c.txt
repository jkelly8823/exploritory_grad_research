VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an uninitialized pointer variable that may lead to undefined behavior or a null pointer dereference.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the `test_string` pointer is only initialized when `i` is not equal to `err_val`. If `i` is equal to `err_val`, the pointer remains uninitialized. When the `printf` function is called with the `test_string` pointer as an argument, it may lead to undefined behavior or a null pointer dereference. This is because the value of `test_string` is not guaranteed to be valid or point to a valid memory location.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `test_string` pointer is always initialized before it is used. This can be achieved by initializing the pointer when it is declared or by adding an else clause to handle the case when `i` is equal to `err_val`. Additionally, it's a good practice to check for null pointer before using it. Here is an example of how to fix the code:

```c
char *test_string = NULL;
if (i != err_val)
{
    test_string = "Hello World!";
}
if (test_string != NULL)
{
    printf("%s", test_string);
}
else
{
    // Handle the case when i is equal to err_val
    printf("Error: Invalid input");
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char *test_string;
if (i != err_val)
{
    test_string = "Hello World!";
}
printf("%s", test_string);
```
