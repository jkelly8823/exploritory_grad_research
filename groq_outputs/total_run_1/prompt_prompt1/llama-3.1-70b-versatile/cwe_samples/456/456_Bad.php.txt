VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in this code is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to modify data that they shouldn't have access to.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the code takes in user input ($username) and uses it to determine whether or not the user is an administrator. However, there is no validation or sanitization of this input, and it is also used to do further privilege escalation actions (setAdmin($username)). Furthermore, it appears that a variable ($isAdmin) is initialized before checking its validity for further actions (deleteUser($userToDelete)). 

If the current user provides a valid administrator's name in the username field, this will almost always elevate the user to administrator privileges without their actually needing the legitimate administrative password. Since this can be easily guessed and exploited by an attacker, using that attacker as the username elevates the attacker to admin for that session. This essentially breaks the "least privilege policy" for users within that application.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommendation would be to further validate and sanitize any user inputs that are passed into functions that handle sensitive actions. Any input received from users must have robust and correct validation in order to check that user access rights and data privacy is protected and the application does not lose data confidentiality integrity. Here is one revised version:

                 if (authenticate($username,$password) && isValidUser($username)) {
                   $isAdmin = isAdmin($username);
                   if($isAdmin){deleteUser($userToDelete);}
                 }

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  if (authenticate($username,$password) && setAdmin($username)){$isAdmin = true;}
                     /.../
                     
                     if ($isAdmin){deleteUser($userToDelete);}
