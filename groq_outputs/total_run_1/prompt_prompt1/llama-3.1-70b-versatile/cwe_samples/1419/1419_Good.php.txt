VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to potential SQL injection attacks, and possibly other attacks, due to the direct use of user input ($_POST) without any sanitization or validation.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly assigns user input from `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` to variables that are then used in a login function. This direct use of untrusted input can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the `login_user` function interacts with a database. Moreover, the lack of input validation allows for potential buffer overflow attacks or other security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should sanitize and validate the user input before passing it to the `login_user` function. You can use PHP's built-in `filter_var` function or frameworks like OWASP ESAPI for Java and OWASP ESAPI for PHP to validate and sanitize the input. Additionally, consider using prepared statements to interact with the database.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to validate the input:

```php
$user = filter_var($_POST['user'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
$pass = filter_var($_POST['pass'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);

// Validate the input
if (empty($user) || empty($pass)) {
    // Handle invalid input
    exit;
}

if (login_user($user, $pass)) {
    $authorized = true;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
