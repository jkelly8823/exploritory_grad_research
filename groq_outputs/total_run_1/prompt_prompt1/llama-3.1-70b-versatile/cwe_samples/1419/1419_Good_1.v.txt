VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The potential vulnerability is an out-of-bounds memory access or unintended memory initialization.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is implementing a reset operation that initializes an array `acct_mem`. However, the size of the array is determined by `AcCt_MEM_SIZE`, which may not be a constant or may be incorrectly calculated. In SystemVerilog, arrays must have a constant size that is known at compile time. If `AcCt_MEM_SIZE` is not a constant or is greater than the actual size of the array, this can result in out-of-bounds memory accesses or unintended memory initialization.

Additionally, the loop variable `j` is not declared with a specific bit width. In SystemVerilog, the `int` type is used for loop counters by default, and the integer width can be platform-dependent. If the integer width is not sufficient to represent the loop counter, it may cause unexpected behavior or overflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this potential vulnerability, ensure that `AcCt_MEM_SIZE` is a constant or parameter and is correctly calculated. Additionally, declare the loop variable `j` with a specific bit width using the `logic` keyword.

```
module acct_wrapper #(
    ...
    
    parameter logic [31:0] AcCt_MEM_SIZE = 256 // Replace 256 with the actual size of the array
    
    );
    
    logic [31:0] j;
    
    always @(posedge clk_i)
    begin
        if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_6))
        begin
            j = 0;
            while (j < AcCt_MEM_SIZE)
            begin
                acct_mem[j] <= 32'h00000000;
                j = j + 1;
            end
        end
    end
    
    ...

ORIGINAL CODE:
module acct_wrapper #(
...
...
    
    always @(posedge clk_i)
    
        begin
        
            if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_6))
            
                begin
                
                    for (j=0; j < AcCt_MEM_SIZE; j=j+1)
                    
                        begin
                        
                            acct_mem[j] <= 32'h00000000;
                        
                        end
                    
                
                end
            
        
        ...
