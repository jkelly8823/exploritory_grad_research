VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code segment is vulnerable to information disclosure due to the customErrors mode being set to "On".

EXPLANATION:
The customErrors mode is set to "On", which means that ASP.NET will display a custom error page, as specified by the defaultRedirect attribute, in case of an error. However, the defaultRedirect attribute is set to "YourErrorPage.htm", which suggests that a generic error page is being displayed. This configuration can be vulnerable to information disclosure if the error page does not properly handle sensitive information. Furthermore, this setting can be considered as providing a false sense of security, as it can be used to mask error messages, making it harder to diagnose and fix errors. However, the most pressing concern with setting customErrors mode to 'On' without a detailed error setting will only be beneficial when a custom error page is to be displayed for certain exceptions only and a detailed error report will need to be displayed on the local machine when an unhandled exception occurs. A generic setting like this would be better placed elsewhere than as a security testing variable but still may serve as a variable to information disclosure via a less protected route.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to set the customErrors mode to "RemoteOnly" or "Off" (in a development environment) to ensure that detailed error messages are not exposed to remote users. Additionally, it is advised to create a custom error page that properly handles sensitive information and provides a generic error message to users.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" />
