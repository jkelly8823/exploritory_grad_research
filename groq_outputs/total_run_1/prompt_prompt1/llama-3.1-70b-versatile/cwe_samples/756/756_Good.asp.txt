VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The use of `<customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />` can allow an attacker to deduce the nature of an error, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The `<customErrors>` directive in ASP.NET is used to handle and display error messages to users. The `mode="RemoteOnly"` attribute means that custom error pages will be displayed only when the request comes from a remote client, and not when the request is made from the local machine. This can lead to information disclosure, as it allows an attacker to deduce the nature of the error, such as a database connection failure or a file not found error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend using the `<customErrors>` directive with the `mode="On"` attribute, and also setting up custom error pages for specific error codes. This way, sensitive information is not disclosed to the attacker.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />
