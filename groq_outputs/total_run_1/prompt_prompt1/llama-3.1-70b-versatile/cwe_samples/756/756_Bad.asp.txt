VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The customErrors mode is set to "Off" in the application configuration, which allows detailed error messages to be displayed to users.

EXPLANATION:
Having customErrors set to "Off" in a production environment can lead to information disclosure, as it reveals detailed information about the internal workings of the application, including the specific error messages and the line numbers where the errors occurred. This can be exploited by attackers to gather information about the application, including potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to set the customErrors mode to "On" and provide a custom error page for users to see when an error occurs. This will prevent sensitive error information from being displayed to users.

```
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="ErrorPage.aspx" />
```

Alternatively, consider setting up error handling and logging so that errors are logged for monitoring and diagnosis purposes but not exposed to users.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<customErrors mode="Off" />
