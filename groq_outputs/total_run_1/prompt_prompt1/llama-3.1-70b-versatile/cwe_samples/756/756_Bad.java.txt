VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential logging of sensitive information vulnerability. When an ApplicationSpecificException is caught, its string representation is logged, potentially revealing sensitive details about the application.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, when an ApplicationSpecificException is caught, the `ase.toString()` method is called, which may return sensitive information about the application. This sensitive information can then be logged and potentially exposed to unauthorized parties. An attacker can use this information to launch further attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:
1.  Log only non-sensitive information about the exception, such as the exception type or a generic error message. For example:
        ```java
catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
    logger.error("Error occurred: " + ase.getClass().getName());
}
```
2.  Consider logging the exception message or details at a DEBUG level, which is typically not logged in production environments, to balance debugging needs with security considerations:
        ```java
catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
    logger.debug("Exception details: " + ase.toString());
    logger.error("Error occurred");
}
```
3.  Use a logging framework that supports exception logging with a mechanism to filter out sensitive information. For example, some logging frameworks support logging exceptions with a `errorMessage` or `errorDescription` parameter, which can be used to log a sanitized error message.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {
        ...
    } catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
    }
}
```
