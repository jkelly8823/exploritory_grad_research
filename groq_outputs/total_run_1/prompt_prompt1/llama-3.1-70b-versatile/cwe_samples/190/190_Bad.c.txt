VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: The code is incomplete, making it hard to assign exact line numbers. However, the vulnerable lines are related to 'table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);' and lack of validation of 'num_imgs'.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing input validation and potential integer overflow when allocating memory with 'malloc'.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is allocating memory using 'malloc' for an array of 'img_t' structs based on the value of 'num_imgs' obtained from the function 'get_num_imgs()'. However, the code does not seem to perform any validation or bounds checking on the value of 'num_imgs' before using it in the 'malloc' call. This can lead to two potential issues: integer overflow and buffer overflow. If 'num_imgs' is very large, the calculation 'sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs' might overflow and wrap around, resulting in less memory being allocated than intended. Additionally, 'malloc' might fail to allocate the requested amount of memory, returning a null pointer. If not checked for, this can lead to crashes or undefined behavior when trying to access the allocated memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the value of 'num_imgs' before using it to allocate memory. Make sure it's within reasonable bounds.
2. Check the return value of 'malloc' to ensure the operation was successful and handle cases where it returns null.
3. Consider using 'calloc' instead of 'malloc' to initialize the allocated memory, which helps prevent buffer overflows in case 'malloc' only allocates a partial amount of memory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;

...

num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
...
```
