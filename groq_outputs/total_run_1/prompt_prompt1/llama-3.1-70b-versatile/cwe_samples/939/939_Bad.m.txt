VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated User Input in UIWebView
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a client-side JavaScript injection attack. The UIWebView's method writeDataToView is being passed unvalidated user input directly retrieved from URL query. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to security risks such as data theft, remote code execution, or data tampering. 

This vulnerability exists because there is no validation or sanitization of the query data before it is used to generate content for the web view.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and Sanitize User Input: To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to validate and sanitize any user input before passing it to the web view. You can use a whitelist approach to only allow a set of predetermined query parameters.

2. Use WKWebView Instead of UIWebView: WKWebView is a more secure and efficient alternative to UIWebView. WKWebView provides built-in protection against some types of JavaScript injection attacks.

Here's how the validated code might look like:

```objc
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];
    if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
        NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];
        if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
            NSString *queryString = [URL query];
            if([queryString isEqualToString:@"allowedParameter"]) {
                UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:queryString];
            }
            return NO;
        }
    }
    return YES;
}
```
In the recommended code above, the `queryString` is validated against a specific allowed value `"allowedParameter"`. You should replace this with your actual allowed query parameters.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```objc
// iOS
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
        NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
            // Make data available back in webview.
            UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
            return NO;
        }
    }return YES;
}
```
