VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5-6, 8, 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection attacks. This occurs when an attacker injects malicious commands into the system through user input.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, the function 'ExecuteGitCommand' takes in a 'name' string and an array of 'arg' strings. These are then used to construct a command with 'exec.Command' without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage or code execution.

Specifically vulnerable lines include:
- 3: 'c := exec.Command(name, arg...)' because it directly uses the 'name' and 'arg' without proper validation or sanitization.
- 5-6, 8: 'c.Path, err = exec.LookPath(name)' could potentially return incorrect paths if 'name' is malicious. It would be better to directly provide the path instead of relying on exec.LookPath.
- 10-13: The code does not validate the 'name' or 'arg' inputs before passing them to exec.Command. This leaves a potential entry point for injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, proper input validation and sanitization are essential. Consider using 'os/exec' package's 'CommandContext' instead, which allows you to set a timeout and avoid infinite execution.

Here are some steps to improve the code:

- Restrict the commands that can be executed by white-listing the 'name' parameter.
- Sanitize and validate the 'name' and 'arg' arrays before passing them to 'exec.Command'.
- Use 'os/exec' package's 'CommandContext' to set a timeout.
- Implement error checking to handle potential command execution failures.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```go
func ExecuteGitCommand(name string, arg []string) error {
    c := exec.Command(name, arg...)
    var err error
    c.Path, err = exec.LookPath(name)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
}
```
