VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability in this code is a potential data exposure due to a lack of proper error handling when removing a temporary file.

EXPLANATION:
The code creates a temporary file and assigns it to a `FILE*` pointer called `stream`. However, after the file is created and used, the code uses the `remove()` function to delete the temporary file in `rmtmp()`. If any part of the file operations between creation and removal fail, but `remove()` succeeds, the contents of the file may still be exposed on disk until they are eventually overwritten.

For example, if an error occurs between the `tmpfile()` call and the `remove()` call, but `remove()` does not fail, an attacker that has gained access to the system may still be able to read the contents of the temporary file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

- Before deleting the temporary file, check if any file operations have failed and handle the failure accordingly. This will prevent sensitive data from being exposed on disk.
- Consider using the `unlink()` system call instead of `remove()` to delete the file, as it allows for more control over the deletion process.
- Ensure that error checking is done after every file operation to catch and handle any errors that may occur.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  FILE *stream;
if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {
                        
                           perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");return (-1);
                     }
                     // write data to tmp file
                     ...// remove tmp file
rm(tmp());
```
Note: Please note that `rm(tmp())` does not exist in C so its likely a wrapper has been written or should be `remove(tmpfile)`
