VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory traversal vulnerability due to hardcoded relative path.

EXPLANATION:
The `appPropertiesConfigFile` static variable is using a hardcoded relative path, which can potentially lead to a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs because an attacker can manipulate the path to access files outside the intended directory. For instance, if an attacker can influence the path used to load the configuration file, they can potentially access sensitive files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following:

- Use absolute paths for file locations whenever possible. This can be achieved by using a combination of `File` or `Path` classes to build the absolute path.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive paths or file names. Instead, consider using environment variables or secure configuration files to store this information.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization for any user-input parameters that may influence the file path.
- Use a secure directory traversal prevention mechanism, such as the `Path.GetFullPath` method in .NET, to ensure that file access is restricted within the intended directory.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  class SomeAppClass {
                        
                           public:static const string appPropertiesConfigFile = "app/properties.config";
                           ...
                     }
               

Example of a fixed version:
```csharp
using System.IO;

public class SomeAppClass
{
    public static readonly string AppPropertiesConfigFile
    {
        get
        {
            // Use a secure and absolute path for file locations
            return Path.GetFullPath("app/properties.config");
        }
    }
}
```
