VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded sensitive data in source code
EXPLANATION:
 The provided code contains a hardcoded file path to a properties file ("app/Application.properties"). This is potentially sensitive information, as properties files may contain database credentials, API keys, or other confidential data. Hardcoding this information into source code can pose a vulnerability to the application's security.

 In a real-world scenario, this code might be committed to a version control system, making the sensitive information available to unauthorized parties. Moreover, even if access to the version control system is restricted, someone with access to the application's binary or source code can still exploit this vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To address this vulnerability, consider the following approaches:

 1.  Use environment variables: Instead of hardcoding the file path, consider storing it in an environment variable that can be easily updated and changed without modifying the source code.

 2.  Use a secure configuration mechanism: Implement a secure configuration mechanism that allows you to store sensitive information outside of the source code. This could involve using a secrets manager or an encrypted configuration file.

 3.  Apply encryption: If you cannot entirely remove the hardcoded information, consider encrypting the properties file or using an encrypted connection to load the properties.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class SomeAppClass {
    // ...
    public static String appPropertiesFile = "app/Application.properties";
    // ...
}
```
