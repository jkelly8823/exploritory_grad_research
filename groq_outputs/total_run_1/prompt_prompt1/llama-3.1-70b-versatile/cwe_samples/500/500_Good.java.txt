VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoding sensitive data

EXPLANATION:
The variable `appPropertiesFile` is hardcoded with a file path to a sensitive configuration file (`app/Application.properties`). This file path may contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other security-related settings. Hardcoding such information can lead to several security issues, including data breaches and unauthorized system access. An attacker who gains access to the codebase can immediately identify the location of sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following:

1.  Use environment variables: Environment variables can be used to store sensitive file paths. This way, the sensitive information is not hardcoded in the code.

    ```java
public class SomeAppClass {
    public static final String appPropertiesFile = System.getenv("APP_PROPERTIES_FILE");
    ...
}
```

2.  Use a secure configuration management system: Consider using a configuration management tool that securely stores sensitive configuration values.

    ```java
public class SomeAppClass {
    public static final String appPropertiesFile = Configuration.getProperty("app.properties.file");
    ...
}
```

3.  Consider storing sensitive file paths in a separate, secure configuration file that can be loaded at runtime.

    ```java
public class SomeAppClass {
    public static final String appPropertiesFile = ConfigurationLoader.getProperties().getProperty("app.properties.file");
    ...
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  public class SomeAppClass {
                        // ...
                           public static final String appPropertiesFile = "app/Application.properties";...
                     }
