VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Combinatorial logic in sequential always block and non-registered output in an always block.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a mix of sequential and combinational logic in a single always block, which is generally discouraged in good coding practices. Specifically, lines 7 and 10-11 contain non-registered variable 'data_out' and combinational logic (ternary operator for grant_access and data_out), respectively. These construct are better placed in different always blocks, with combinational logic not associated with a specific edge and sequential logic using the 'clk' and 'rst_n' in the sensitivity list.

The usage of 'assign' inside an 'always' block in a sequential circuit will not work as expected and must be avoided.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should separate the combinational logic and sequential logic into different blocks. Here's how you could refactor the code:

ORIGINAL CODE:


always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
begin
  if (!rst_n)
    data_out <= 0;
  else
    data_out <= (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
end

always @ (*)
begin
  grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
end
