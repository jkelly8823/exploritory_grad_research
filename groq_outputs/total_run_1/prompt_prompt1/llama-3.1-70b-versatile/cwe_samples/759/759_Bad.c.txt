VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses a potentially weak hashing algorithm for password verification and also uses an insecure method of comparing the two passwords.

EXPLANATION:
The use of SHA1 for hashing passwords is potentially insecure due to its collisions and the fact that modern GPUs can perform a brute force attack on it relatively quickly. Additionally, the use of the `equal` function for comparing the two passwords may make this code vulnerable to timing attacks. A timing attack can reveal the number of bytes that match between the two passwords by the time taken by the comparison function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended hashing algorithm for passwords is a key-derivation function like PBKDF2, Argon2, or Bcrypt. These functions are designed to be slow, making them more resilient to brute force attacks. Additionally, instead of comparing the two passwords directly, we should compare their hash values using a constant time comparison function to prevent timing attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) { 
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
        login_user();
    }
}
```
