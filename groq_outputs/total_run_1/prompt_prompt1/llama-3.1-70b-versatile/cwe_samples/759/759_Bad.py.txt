VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code stores passwords using the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is known to be vulnerable to collisions and is not suitable for password storage.

EXPLANATION:
The MD5 hashing algorithm is a weak hashing algorithm that was designed for data integrity, not for password storage. It is vulnerable to collisions, which means that different input values can produce the same output hash. Moreover, MD5 is considered to be broken for cryptographic purposes due to its vulnerability to rainbow table attacks. Using MD5 to store passwords can lead to compromised passwords being discovered by attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a strong password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2 to store passwords. These algorithms are designed to be computationally expensive, slow, and memory-intensive, which makes them more resistant to brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks. Additionally, use a salt value to prevent rainbow table attacks. A salt is a random value that is added to the password before it is hashed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def storePassword(userName, Password):
    hasher = hashlib.new('md5')
    hasher.update(Password)
    hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```

Example of how to use a strong password hashing algorithm (bcrypt):

```python
import bcrypt

def storePassword(userName, Password):
    hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashpw(Password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```
