VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses MD5 hashing algorithm, a salt value, and does not check the hash length before storing it.

EXPLANATION:
The main issue with this code is that MD5 is not a secure hashing algorithm for storing passwords. MD5 is considered broken due to collisions and the speed of the algorithm. Additionally, the strength of the password is not validated and the length of the resultant hash is not checked, however this is less problematic than the algorithm strength. Using a salt doesn't necessarily make the hash more secure if the hashing algorithm itself is weak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2, which are widely accepted and have stood the test of time. 
- Use the hashlib's pbkdf2 module for better security. 
- Use os.urandom() to generate a random salt for each user. 
- Implement input validation to check the length and complexity of the passwords.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                        # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                        return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```
