VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present is that of using a sticky broadcast with sensitive data. Sticky broadcasts are used to send data that persist even after the broadcast has been sent, making it accessible to all applications, not just the intended recipients.

EXPLANATION:
The use of `sendStickyBroadcast` in conjunction with sensitive data, in this case, `uname_string`, can be problematic. The 'sticky' nature of the broadcast means that the data is persisted even after the broadcast has been sent. This allows the data to be accessed by any other application that has the appropriate permissions, posing a security risk. Additionally, using Extras to send user credentials in an Intent can expose sensitive data if not handled properly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `sendStickyBroadcast`, consider using a standard broadcast or an ordered broadcast with specific permissions if only certain apps should receive the broadcast. Additionally, consider encrypting or using secure storage for sensitive data such as user credentials. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction("com.example.service.UserExists");
intent.putExtra("Username", uname_string);
sendStickyBroadcast(intent);
```

Note: Always be cautious when dealing with sensitive data, and consider reviewing the Android Developer documentation and platform updates for best practices on securing user credentials and broadcasts in Android.
