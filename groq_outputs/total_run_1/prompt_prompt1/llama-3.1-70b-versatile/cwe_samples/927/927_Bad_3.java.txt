VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to 'Android Intent Exposed Broadcast' vulnerability, which allows unauthorized access to sensitive data or execution of malicious code.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses 'sendBroadcast' method with an Intent that is not explicitly targeted to a specific component or package. This makes the Intent available to any app on the device that has the 'android.permission.INTERNET' permission, which is a common permission used by many apps. A malicious app can receive this Intent and access the data in the 'file_uri' field, potentially leading to data leaks or execution of malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a more targeted approach to broadcasting Intents by specifying the package or component name. This will limit the Intent to only the intended app and prevent unauthorized access.
2. Use 'LocalBroadcastManager' instead of 'sendBroadcast' if the Intent is meant to be used within the same app. This ensures that the Intent is not accessible to external apps.
3. Use 'sendBroadcast' with a limited scope, such as setting the 'Intent.FLAG_INCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES' flag to false, to prevent malicious apps from receiving the Intent even if they are stopped.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction("com.example.BackupUserData");
intent.setData(file_uri);
intent.addFlags(FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
sendBroadcast(intent);

Example of a more secure approach:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent("com.example.BackupUserData");
intent.setData(file_uri);
intent.setPackage(getPackageName()); // Specify the package name
sendBroadcast(intent);
```
