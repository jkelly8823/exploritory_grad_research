VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-After-Free and Double-Free vulnerabilities

EXPLANATION:
The given code segment is vulnerable to both Use-After-Free and Double-Free vulnerabilities. 

In the given code, `ptr` is freed if `abrt` is true, but it is freed again in the following line, regardless of the value of `abrt`. This is a Double-Free vulnerability because the program is attempting to free the same block of memory twice.

Additionally, if `abrt` is true, and the code between the first free and the second free uses `ptr`, it would be a Use-After-Free vulnerability because the code is accessing memory that has already been freed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, we should restructure the code to avoid freeing the same memory twice and avoid using memory after it has been freed. Here is a potential fix:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
// ...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // ptr is now invalid
}
// ...
if (ptr) { // only free ptr if it is still valid
    free(ptr);
}
```
This revised code ensures that `ptr` is only freed once and that we do not use it after it has been freed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
