VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-After-Free vulnerability is present in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be handling memory allocation and error checking. However, it also contains a potential use-after-free vulnerability. After checking the 'err' variable and setting 'abrt' to 1, the code frees the previously allocated memory using 'free(ptr)'. Later, if 'abrt' is true, the code attempts to use the already freed 'ptr' by passing it to 'logError' function.

This use-after-free vulnerability can cause undefined behavior, which may lead to crashes, data corruption, or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, do not use the freed 'ptr' variable in the 'logError' function. If the log error function needs the allocated data, it should be moved before the 'free(ptr)' statement. Alternatively, if the log error function only needs the allocation address, consider using a different variable to store it before freeing the allocated memory.

Additionally, always check the return value of 'malloc' to ensure that the memory allocation was successful. The 'err' variable seems to be used for error checking, but its initialization and meaning are unclear in this code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
if (err) { 
    abrt = 1; 
    free(ptr);
} 
...
if (abrt) { 
    logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
}
