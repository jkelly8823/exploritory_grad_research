VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential NullPointerException (NPE) due to the possibility of currentUser being null when its Info() method is called.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains an object 'currentUser' which is being used to call a method 'Info()'. However, there is no guarantee that 'currentUser' is not null at this point in the code. If 'currentUser' is null, this would cause a NullPointerException (NPE) when trying to call 'Info()'. This type of issue can lead to unexpected app crashes or other runtime errors, especially when used in multithreaded environments or in cases where other parts of the code might set 'currentUser' to null.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to add null checks before calling any methods on 'currentUser'. Here's an example:

```java
final class JavaScriptInterface {
    JavaScriptInterface () { }

    @JavascriptInterface
    public String getUserInfo() {
        if (currentUser != null) {
            return currentUser.Info();
        } else {
            return null; // or any other default behavior suitable for your application
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you could also use the Java 8 Optional class to avoid NPE:

```java
final class JavaScriptInterface {
    JavaScriptInterface () { }

    @JavascriptInterface
    public String getUserInfo() {
        return Optional.ofNullable(currentUser)
                .map(JavaScriptInterface::Info)
                .orElse(null); // or any other default behavior suitable for your application
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
final class JavaScriptInterface {
    JavaScriptInterface () { }

    @JavascriptInterface
    public String getUserInfo() {return currentUser.Info();}
}
```
