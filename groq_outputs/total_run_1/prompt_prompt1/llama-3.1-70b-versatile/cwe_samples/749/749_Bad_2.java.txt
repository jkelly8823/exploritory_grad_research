VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 7, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This Android code is vulnerable to a JavaScript Interface Injection vulnerability. This occurs when a WebView exposes sensitive functionality to untrusted JavaScript through the JavaScript Interface mechanism. If the JavaScript Interface has methods that can be accessed from JavaScript, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code to access those methods and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, a JavaScriptInterface is exposed to the WebView and has a method getUserInfo() that seems to retrieve sensitive user information. However, since this method is accessible from JavaScript, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code to call this method and access sensitive information. The fact that JavaScript is enabled in the WebView makes this possible. Additionally, the WebView is loading a local HTML file which may contain sensitive data or functionality that can be accessed by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, recommend the following changes:

1. Make sure to validate and sanitize any inputs passed to the JavaScript interface methods to prevent XSS attacks.
2. Use the " @JavascriptInterface" annotation on methods in the JavaScript interface class to define which methods can be accessed from JavaScript. However, make sure to only expose methods that do not leak sensitive functionality or data to the JavaScript interface.
3. Consider using an alternative to the JavaScript interface, such as posting messages between JavaScript and the Android app.
4. Validate that the local HTML file loaded into the WebView does not contain sensitive data or functionality that can be accessed by an attacker.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public class WebViewGUI extends Activity {
   WebView mainWebView;
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);mainWebView = new WebView(this);mainWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);mainWebView.addJavascriptInterface(new JavaScriptInterface(), "userInfoObject");mainWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html");setContentView(mainWebView);}
   final class JavaScriptInterface {
      JavaScriptInterface () {}
      public String getUserInfo() {return currentUser.Info();}
   }
}
```
