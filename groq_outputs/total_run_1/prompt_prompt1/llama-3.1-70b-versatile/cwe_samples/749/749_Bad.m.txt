VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a code injection through a UIWebView, as it passes user-controlled data directly into [self writeDataToView:[URL query]]. This allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the app's web view.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the URL scheme is "exampleScheme", and if so, extracts the resource specifier and checks if it has a prefix "specialFunction". However, it does not validate or sanitize the data from the URL query parameter before passing it to the [self writeDataToView:[URL query]] method, which appears to execute JavaScript code within the web view. This could allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the URL query parameter. This type of vulnerability is often referred to as a "code injection" or "DOM-based XSS" vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user-controlled data: Before passing the URL query parameter to [self writeDataToView:[URL query]], ensure that the data is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious code injection.
2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed within the web view. This can help prevent malicious code injection if the validation/sanitization step fails.
3. Avoid using stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString: Instead of using stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString to execute JavaScript code, consider alternative approaches such as using UIWebView's loadHTMLString method to load static HTML content.

ORIGINAL CODE:


// iOS
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
          NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                
               
               // Make data available back in webview.
               UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
         }return NO;
     }return YES;
