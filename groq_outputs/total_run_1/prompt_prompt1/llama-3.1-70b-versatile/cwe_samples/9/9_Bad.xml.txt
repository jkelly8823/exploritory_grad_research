VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unrestricted Method Permission Vulnerability

This vulnerability involves assigning a method permission to the "ANYONE" role, giving unauthorized access to the specified method.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, a method permission is assigned to the "ANYONE" role for the "getSalary" method of the "Employee" EJB. This means that anyone with access to the system can invoke this method, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to extract confidential employee salary information, potentially causing significant harm to the organization.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

* Ensure that method permissions are assigned to specific, legitimate roles rather than the "ANYONE" role.
* Review and refine the role definitions to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive methods.
* Implement access controls to ensure that methods handling sensitive data are secure and can only be invoked by authorized users.
