VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided segment of code is vulnerable to a Resource Leak due to an Unhandled Exception.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, memory is dynamically allocated using the `new` keyword. However, if an exception occurs between memory allocation and deallocation, the memory will not be freed, resulting in a memory leak. Furthermore, if an exception occurs in the `BarObj` constructor, the destructor of `BarObj` will not be called. This can cause resources like file handles or network connections to remain open.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use smart pointers or try-catch blocks to ensure resources are properly cleaned up even if an exception occurs. Here are some fixes:

1. Using smart pointers:

```cpp
void foo() {
    std::unique_ptr<BarObj> ptr = std::make_unique<BarObj>();
    // Do some work with ptr here
}
```

2. Using try-catch blocks:

```cpp
void foo() {
    BarObj* ptr = new BarObj();
    try {
        // Do some work with ptr here
    } catch (...) {
        delete ptr;
        throw;  // Re-throw the exception to maintain the original flow
    }
    delete ptr;
}
```

However, the try-catch block can be avoided with the use of a smart pointer, which is a more C++-way of doing this. Also, exception handling should ideally be kept near the throw point instead of propagating with a re-throw.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```cpp
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    
    ...
    delete ptr;
}
```
