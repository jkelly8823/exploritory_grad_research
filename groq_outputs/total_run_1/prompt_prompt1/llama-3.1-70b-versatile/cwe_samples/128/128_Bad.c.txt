VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
A potential integer overflow vulnerability is present when calculating the size for dynamic memory allocation.

EXPLANATION: 
The calculation for malloc is performed with the product of an int (num_imgs) and sizeof(img_t). The overflow occurs when this product exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by size_t (the return type of sizeof()). This can happen when num_imgs is large, leading to an under-allocation of memory. This under-allocation could potentially cause a buffer overflow, as the data is copied into a region that is smaller than required.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent integer overflow vulnerability, you should ensure that the calculation for memory allocation does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by size_t. This can be achieved by using the product of two size_t values and checking if the result overflows before calling malloc. In C99 and later, you can use the multiplication safe function or calculate and check the maximum before calling malloc.

Here is an example of secure code:

```c
size_t num_imgs_size_t = get_num_imgs();
if (num_imgs_size_t > SIZE_MAX / sizeof(img_t)) {
    // Handle overflow error
} else {
    table_ptr = malloc(num_imgs_size_t * sizeof(img_t));
    // Check for malloc failure
}
```
Note that the above code also includes a check for malloc failure to ensure that the memory allocation is successful.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;

// ...

num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
