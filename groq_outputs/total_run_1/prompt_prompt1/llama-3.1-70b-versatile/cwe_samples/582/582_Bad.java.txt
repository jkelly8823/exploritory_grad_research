VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The class `urlTool` has a static `URL` array `urls` and is publicly accessible, which can potentially lead to malicious code injection or exploitation.

EXPLANATION:
The issue here is that the `urls` array is defined as `public final static`, which means it can be accessed from any part of the program. This can potentially allow malicious code to be injected or executed by modifying the URLs in the array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- The `urls` array should be made `private final static` to restrict access to the class itself.
- Access to the `urls` array should be controlled through getter or setter methods to ensure proper validation and sanitization.
- Consider implementing secure coding practices, such as input validation and URL parsing, to prevent malicious code injection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public final class urlTool extends Applet {
   public final static URL[] urls;
}
```
