VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-After-Free Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code presented has a use-after-free vulnerability. The free function is called twice on the same pointer 'ptr'. This is because both the conditional block and the subsequent free(ptr) statement attempt to free the same memory location. This is a problem because once memory is freed, it can be assigned to another variable or overwritten, and accessing the memory location again can result in unpredictable behavior or crashes.

Although not explicitly shown in the provided segment, if the program continues to use the 'ptr' after it has been freed in the conditional block when 'abrt' is true, this would be classified as a use-after-free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, remove one of the free(ptr) calls. The best practice would be to keep the free(ptr) call only once after the 'ptr' is no longer needed. Also, ensure that no further operations are conducted on 'ptr' after it has been freed.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                   char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
                   ...
                   if (abrt) {
                   
                       free(ptr);
                   
                   }
                   ...
                   free(ptr);
