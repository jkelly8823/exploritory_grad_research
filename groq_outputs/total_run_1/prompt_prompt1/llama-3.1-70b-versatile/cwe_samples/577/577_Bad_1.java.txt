VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-15, 17-18
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak, socket not being closed, and potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to infinite loop and unchecked exceptions.

EXPLANATION:
The code has several issues. 

Firstly, the `ServerSocket` and `Socket` resources are not being properly closed, which will cause resource leaks. 

Secondly, the `while (listening)` loop in the constructor can cause an infinite loop and potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, as the `listening` variable is never set to `false` and the `start()` method is called repeatedly. 

Thirdly, the `try`-`catch` blocks do not handle exceptions properly, and errors are silently ignored. 

Lastly, `extends Thread` is discouraged, as it's better to use the `Runnable` and `Executor` frameworks in Java.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Close `ServerSocket` and `Socket` resources properly using `try-finally` or `try-with-resources` blocks.
- Remove the infinite loop from the constructor and handle exceptions properly.
- Replace `extends Thread` with `implements Runnable`.
- Use `ExecutorService` to manage threads.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
@Stateless
public class StockSymbolBean extends Thread implements StockSymbolRemote {
        
    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
    Socket clientSocket = null;
    boolean listening = false;
    
    public StockSymbolBean() {
        try {
            serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT);
        } catch (IOException ex) {...}
        listening = true;
        while(listening) {
            start();
        }
    }
    
    public String getStockSymbol(String name) {...}
    public BigDecimal getStockValue(String symbol) {...}
    public void run() {
        try {
            clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
        } catch (IOException e) {...}
        ...
    }
        
}
```
 
 Fix the above code to match the recommended changes.

```java
@Stateless
public class StockSymbolBean implements StockSymbolRemote, Runnable {
        
    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
    Socket clientSocket = null;
    ExecutorService executorService;
    
    public StockSymbolBean() {
        try {
            serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT);
            executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            //Properly handle exceptions here
        }
    }
    
    public String getStockSymbol(String name) {...}
    public BigDecimal getStockValue(String symbol) {...}
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try (ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT)) {
            while (true) {
                try (Socket client = server.accept()) {
                    // Handle the client socket here
                } catch (IOException ex) {
                    //Properly handle exceptions here
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            //Properly handle exceptions here
        } finally {
            if (serverSocket != null) {
                try {
                    serverSocket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    //Properly handle exceptions here
                }
            }
        }
    }
    // Start a new task using an ExecutorService in the main function, if required
    public void startService(){
        executorService.submit(this);
    }
    // Stop the executor service, when required 
    public void stopService(){
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
    // Other utility methods to control, pause/restart executor service 
}
