VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Equality Check.

EXPLANATION:
The `isSameAccount` method compares two `BankAccount` objects for equality using the `==` operator. However, in Java, the `==` operator checks for reference equality, not value equality. This means it will only return true if both `accountA` and `accountB` refer to the exact same object instance. Instead of checking if the actual account details are the same, it's checking if the objects are the same instance. This can lead to incorrect results when comparing two objects with the same account details but different instances.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should override the `equals()` method in the `BankAccount` class to compare the actual account details. Here's an example:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true;
    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
    BankAccount otherAccount = (BankAccount) obj;
    return accountNumber.equals(otherAccount.accountNumber) && accountHolder.equals(otherAccount.accountHolder); // Assuming accountNumber and accountHolder are relevant fields.
}
```

Then, modify the `isSameAccount` method to use the `equals()` method:

```java
public boolean isSameAccount(BankAccount accountA, BankAccount accountB) {
    return accountA.equals(accountB);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public boolean isSameAccount(BankAccount accountA, BankAccount accountB) {
    return accountA == accountB;
}
```
