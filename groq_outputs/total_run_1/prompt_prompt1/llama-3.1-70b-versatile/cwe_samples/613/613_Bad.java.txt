VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Session Timeout Configuration
The code has an insecure session timeout configuration, which can lead to session fixation attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The session-config element with a session-timeout of -1 indicates that the session will never expire. This can be problematic, as it allows an attacker to maintain a valid session indefinitely, potentially leading to session fixation attacks. In a session fixation attack, an attacker can fixate a user's session and gain access to the user's account.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to set the session timeout to a reasonable value. This can be done by specifying a positive integer value in the session-timeout element. A common practice is to set the session timeout to a shorter duration, such as 30 minutes. Additionally, consider implementing additional security measures, such as:

- Inactivating and invalidating sessions when a user logs out
- Regenerating the session ID after a successful login
- Using an HTTPS connection to protect the session ID from interception

Here is an example of a more secure session timeout configuration:

<session-config><session-timeout>30</session-timeout></session-config>
