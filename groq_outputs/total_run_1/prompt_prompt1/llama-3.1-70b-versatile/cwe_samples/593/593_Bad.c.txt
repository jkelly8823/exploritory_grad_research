VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to certificate validation issues. In the given code, the use of `SSLv23_method()` and the incorrect use of `SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb()` pose significant security concerns.

EXPLANATION:
In the code snippet, we see `ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_method());`. The `SSLv23_method()` function is used to initialize the OpenSSL context. This method allows the server to decide which protocol to use (including SSLv2 and SSLv3, which are vulnerable). By relying on this method, the server can potentially use an insecure protocol version. In 2014, a severe bug, often known as POODLE, was identified in the SSLv3 protocol.

Moreover, the use of `SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb(ctx, "new default password" != 1)` line suggests the code tries to use a default password that should instead be provided by the user.

Although `seed_prng()` function is good to see for proper initialization of pseudo random numbers (which aids to avoid so many possible weaknesses, like replay attacks), I recommend updating code completely when dealing with SSL versions.

Furthermore, even without directly producing issues with security, the piece of code sets a default password in an unusable way with two sets of parentheses; missing definitions, implementations or variables lead to different error types possibly in here.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Update the OpenSSL version: Ensure you are running the latest version of OpenSSL. This helps you ensure the latest security patches are applied.
2.  Use `TLS_method()` instead: Update `ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_method());` to `ctx = SSL_CTX_new(TLS_method());` and set the following option: `SSL_CTX_set_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 | SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3)`. This sets TLS as the default protocol version, disables SSLv2, and disables SSLv3 to prevent POODLE attacks.
3.  Define and use correct `SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb()`: Implement the password handler function by passing it to `SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb()` along with additional user parameters.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
#define CERT "secret.pem"
#define CERT2 "secret2.pem"

int main() {
    SSL_CTX *ctx;
    SSL *ssl;
    init_OpenSSL();
    seed_prng();

    ctx = SSL_CTX_new(SSLv23_method());
    if (SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(ctx, CERT) != 1)
        int_error("Error loading certificate from file");

    if (SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, CERT, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) != 1)
        int_error("Error loading private key from file");

    if (!(ssl = SSL_new(ctx)))
        int_error("Error creating an SSL context");

    if (SSL_CTX_set_default_passwd_cb(ctx, "new default password" != 1))
        int_error("Doing something which is dangerous to do anyways");

    if (!(ssl2 = SSL_new(ctx)))
        int_error("Error creating an SSL context");

}
