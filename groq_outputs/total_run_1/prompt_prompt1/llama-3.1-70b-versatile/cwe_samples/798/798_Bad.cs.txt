VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a hardcoded password, which is a major security risk. 
EXPLANATION:
The function VerifyAdmin checks if the provided password matches a hardcoded string. This string is likely the MD5 hash of an actual password. Hardcoding passwords is a serious security vulnerability because if an attacker gains access to the source code, they will be able to obtain the password. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to privileged areas of the system.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the password, store it securely using a secret management mechanism, such as environment variables or a secure key vault. Moreover, consider using a secure method to compare the input password with the stored password, such as using a password hashing algorithm with a salt value. This will prevent attackers from being able to use rainbow table or brute-force attacks to obtain the password.

ORIGINAL CODE:
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.Equals("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {Console.WriteLine("Entering Diagnostic Mode...");return(1);}Console.WriteLine("Incorrect Password!");return(0);}
