VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Sensitive Information

EXPLANATION:
The provided ResourceBundle properties file contains hardcoded sensitive information, specifically the LDAP username and password. Storing sensitive information in plaintext within a configuration file is a security risk because it could be accessed by unauthorized entities if the file is compromised.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to externalize sensitive information from the code and properties files to a secure secrets management system. This can be achieved by replacing the hardcoded values with placeholders or environment variables that are populated from a secure source at runtime. 

For example, consider using environment variables or a secrets management tool such as HashiCorp's Vault to securely manage sensitive information. These values can be injected into the application using an environment variable, a properties file, or through a configuration management platform.

Additionally, it's also recommended to consider using secure protocols such as LDAP over SSL/TLS to further protect the communication between the application and the LDAP server.
