VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Password Vulnerability. The code contains a hardcoded password ("Mew!") that can be easily accessed by an attacker.

EXPLANATION:
The `VerifyAdmin` function checks the provided password and compares it to a hardcoded password. This is a significant security risk since the hardcoded password can be extracted from the code with relative ease, either by disassembling the binary or accessing the source code directly. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass the authorization mechanism and potentially gain administrative access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using a more secure authentication approach:
1. Store the password securely: Instead of hardcoding the password, store it securely in an environment variable or a secrets management system.
2. Use a secure comparison: Use a secure comparison function to compare the provided password with the stored password. This will prevent timing attacks.
3. Consider a more robust authentication mechanism: Instead of using a simple string comparison, consider using a more robust authentication mechanism such as a challenge-response protocol or a token-based authentication.

ORIGINAL CODE:
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}
