VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the strcpy function to copy command line input into a fixed-size buffer without checking the input size.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is caused by the strcpy function, which copies the string pointed to by argv[1] into the fixed-size buffer buf without checking the length of the input string. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer, causing adjacent memory locations to be overwritten with potentially malicious data. This vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the strncpy function instead of strcpy, and limit the number of characters copied to the length of the buffer minus one, leaving space for the null-terminator. Alternatively, you can use functions like snprintf or printf to copy the string, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to be copied.

 ORIGINAL CODE:

#define BUFSIZE 256
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char buf[BUFSIZE];
    strcpy(buf, argv[1]);
}
