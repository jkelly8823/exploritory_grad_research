VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Path Traversal Vulnerability and Unvalidated User Input Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability and unvalidated user input. The code constructs a file path using unsanitized user input ("reportName"). This allows an attacker to potentially access files outside the intended directory by manipulating the filename. Furthermore, the code then attempts to delete the file, potentially allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input: 
    - Ensure that user input ("reportName") is validated and verified before being used in a file path construction. 
    - Consider using white-listing to ensure that the input only contains allowed characters and formatting.

2. Implement directory security:
    - Instead of directly concatenating user input to a directory path, use a secure method like the `Path.resolve()` function to build paths relative to a base directory.
    - Make sure that the service running this code does not have permissions to access sensitive files outside of the intended reporting directory.

3. Use a configured upload directory:
    - Store reports in a directory that is not a system-provided upload location but a configured one.

4. Limit access to sensitive operations:
    - Ensure that operations such as file deletion are executed under an account with restricted rights, minimizing potential damage from a successful exploit.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
...rFile.delete();
```
