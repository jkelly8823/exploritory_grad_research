VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Assignment instead of comparison.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a condition where an assignment is made instead of a comparison. In the first line of the code, `cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` assigns the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the variable `cert`. This will evaluate to true in most cases because the assignment operation returns the value assigned. However, in C and C-derived languages, the assignment operator `=` has a lower precedence than the comparison operator `==`, which might result in unintended behavior if there's an overlapping condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the assignment operator `=` to the comparison operator `==`. The corrected code line should be: 
`if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) != NULL)`. 

However, note that this still contains the assignment inside the condition. A better practice is to separate the assignment from the condition for improved readability:
```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // rest of the code
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERRCERT_NOT_YET_VALID==foo))
        //do stuff
}
```
