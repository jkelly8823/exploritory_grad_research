VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Denial of Service (DoS) and Information Disclosure vulnerability due to InetSocketAddressResolver DNS reversal of a tainted request Remote IP address.

EXPLANATION:
The code presented is attempting to determine if the remote request is coming from a trusted source by resolving the IP address to a hostname and then checking if the hostname ends with "trustme.com". However, this approach is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack and an information disclosure vulnerability. 

The DoS occurs because a malicious actor can manipulate the DNS service to cause the DNS lookup to take an excessively long time, leading to a DoS of the application.

Additionally, there is an information disclosure vulnerability. If an attacker can control the DNS service for the IP address of a machine making a request to this system, they may be able to make DNS lookups for internal systems and retrieve their hostnames and resolve them back to an IP that allows them to infer information about the internal network. 

The use of `InetAddress.getByName()` should also be scrutinized as this does a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookups are meant to validate the host name of the incoming IP address.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider using alternative methods to determine if the request is coming from a trusted source, such as validating against a list of known trusted IP addresses or using a more robust authentication mechanism. Additionally, consider implementing DNS lookup caching or using alternative methods such as checking the `X-Forwarded-For` header. Be sure to log any failures of this check and consider implementing additional logging for each client that it tests as you will want know which clients are making spoofed requests.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {trusted = true;}
