VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a remote file inclusion (Path Traversal) and is also vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). However, the most significant vulnerability here is based on the usage of a potentially tainted cookie and user data. The problems arise in that users are given control of the authentication decision and the fact that a cookie is used in determining this status. The usage of the cookie and user data directly make this code vulnerable to a DOM-based and cross-site scripting (XSS) attack as well as potential Path Traversal. Furthermore, potential insecure practices such as storing passwords, using "Die",  lack of  validation of passed information, and not enforcing secure communication to data servers.


EXPLANATION:
This code has several major issues but the two most significant problems that it poses relates to what happens when the AuthenticateUser and DisplayMedicalHistory functions. As seen in the code, AuthenticateUser is designed to take the user entered information from post, authenticate it with some unknown resource,  and then returns a value depending on the success or failure.  On the surface this might seem fine, but one problem arises when AuthenticateUser and its resource do not actually manage to check or escape certain forms of injected information. Then, the subsequent function call: DisplayMedicalHistory($_POST['patient_ID']) forces one to ask at least two questions: What ensures the authenticity of the entered patients Identification number, and assuming the identification number is fake or maliciously formed what safeguards does DisplayMedicalHistory function have that prevent information leaks on all data associated the entered Identification Number.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Escape or validate the all POST data, especially patient_ID before passing it as an argument. This is particularly for security against DOM-based and cross-site scripting attacks (XSS). A popular library or module exists for virtually all languages and could be easily be implemented for help here, this include Twig, Django and Django_Crispy_form to name a few.

2. Follow all industry recognized conventions in creating, encrypting, checking and protecting all users' entered information. While knowledge of the AuthenticateUser functions inner mechanics are unknown, safe practices dictate that one should be careful how and with what a password is compared to (Such as comparing the entered string, with its input in some hashed form in respect, in its appropriate columns) This can be proven by examining how each of these functions access data in the code.

3. Protect user data by enforcing all rules for communication with any programs or data APIs by turning on HTTPS protocol (SSL/TLS or its now default protocol TLS v 1.3.) as well all other code protocol when security should be ensured. Furthermore, Protect information in post's with the methods offered by current chosen POST server from not required cookies.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$auth = $_COOKIES['authenticated'];if (! $auth) {if (AuthenticateUser($_POST['user'], $_POST['password']) == "success") {// save the cookie to send out in future responsessetcookie("authenticated", "1", time()+60*60*2);}else {ShowLoginScreen();die("\n");}}DisplayMedicalHistory($_POST['patient_ID']);
