VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability exists in the code due to the inconsistent application of debug mode checks.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, `debug_mode_i` is used to conditionally assign a value of `0` to `key_big0` and `key_big1`. However, this check is missing in the assignment of `key_big2`. This inconsistency raises concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive data in non-debug environments. If `key_big2` contains sensitive data, it will be used in `key_big` regardless of the debug mode.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to consistently apply the debug mode check across all key assignments. The corrected code for `key_big2` should be:

```verilog
assign key_big2    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key2[0], key2[1], key2[2], key2[3], key2[4], key2[5]};
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
assign key_big0    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key0[0],
key0[1], key0[2], key0[3], key0[4], key0[5]};

assign key_big1    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key1[0],
key1[1], key1[2], key1[3], key1[4], key1[5]};

assign key_big2    = {key2[0], key2[1], key2[2],
key2[3], key2[4], key2[5]};
...
assign key_big = key_sel[1] ? key_big2 : ( key_sel[0] ? key_big1 : key_big0 );
```
