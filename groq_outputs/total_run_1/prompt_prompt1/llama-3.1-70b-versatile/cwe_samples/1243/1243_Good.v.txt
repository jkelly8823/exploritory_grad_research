VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The vulnerability is a potential side-channel attack through debug mode information leakage.

EXPLANATION:
The debug_mode_i variable appears to be a conditional that decides the value of key_big0, key_big1, and key_big2. When debug_mode_i is true, these variables are set to all zeros, and when it's false, they are set to their actual values based on key0, key1, and key2. However, in secure cryptographic implementations, debug information should not reveal any sensitive information. This conditional assignment could potentially introduce a side channel vulnerability.

Additionally, the implementation seems to allow the key values to be disabled or set to all zeros when debug_mode_i is true. If an attacker has control over the input or the environment of the debug mode, this can potentially allow them to exploit or backdoor the cryptographic system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it's recommended to:

1. Avoid the use of debug_mode_i for setting sensitive cryptographic variables like key values. Instead, use environment-specific constants or switches, and make sure they are not under an attacker's control.

2. If the intention of the debug_mode_i is to test the functionality of the cryptographic component under test conditions, use proper testing strategies and mock variables to mimic real values.

3. Implement proper secure key management practices. Keep the key values confidential, and never set them to all zeros, as this could compromise the security of the system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
assign key_big0    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key0[0], key0[1], key0[2], key0[3], key0[4], key0[5]};
assign key_big1    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key1[0], key1[1], key1[2], key1[3], key1[4], key1[5]};
assign key_big2    = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : {key2[0], key2[1], key2[2], key2[3], key2[4], key2[5]};
...
assign key_big = debug_mode_i ? 192'b0 : (key_sel[1] ? key_big2 : (key_sel[0] ? key_big1 : key_big0));
