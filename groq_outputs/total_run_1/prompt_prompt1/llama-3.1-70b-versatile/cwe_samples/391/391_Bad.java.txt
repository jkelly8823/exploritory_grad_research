Uncaught Exception and Potentially Unhandled Exception Path

EXPLANATION: 
The code provided contains an exception-handling block, which catches a `RareException`. However, the comment suggests that the developer does not expect this exception to occur. The issue here is that the exception is caught but not handled or logged, which may mask an actual underlying issue that led to the exception occurring. If an unexpected exception is thrown, this will still allow the program to continue, but may leave the system in an unknown or unpredictable state.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Always log or handle exceptions to provide visibility into any issues that occur.
- Consider whether catching the exception is sufficient or if it should be re-thrown to propagate the error.
- Validate the `RareException` type to ensure that it is correctly being caught, if expected exceptions may be being masked.

ORIGINAL CODE:
try {doExchange();}catch (RareException e) {
      // this can never happen
  }
