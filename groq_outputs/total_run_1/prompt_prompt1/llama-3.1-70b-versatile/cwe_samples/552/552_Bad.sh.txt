VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The script sets 'allow-blob-public-access' to true, which can expose blob data in the storage account to the public.

EXPLANATION:
The '--allow-blob-public-access' option controls anonymous access to blob data in the storage account. By setting this option to true, any user with the blob URL can access the data, which can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. This is a significant vulnerability as sensitive data should not be made publicly accessible.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
We highly recommend setting '--allow-blob-public-access' to false to restrict public access to blob data in the storage account. This will ensure that access to blob data is limited to authorized users only.

Use the following command to update the storage account:
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false

If anonymous access is required, consider implementing a more secure and controlled solution such as Azure Storage's "Public access level" or Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access true
