VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unrestricted Access to Storage Buckets.

EXPLANATION:
The given code segment appears to be a JSON-formatted configuration for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Identity and Access Management (IAM) bindings. The vulnerability lies in granting public access to the storage buckets by including "allUsers" in the members for the "roles/storage.legacyBucketReader" role. This means anyone with internet access can read the contents of the storage bucket, potentially exposing sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove or replace "allUsers" with a more restrictive set of members (e.g., specific service accounts or accounts within the organization).
- Consider using more fine-grained access control mechanisms, such as bucket-level access control or object-level access control, instead of legacy bucket roles.
- If public access is necessary, implement additional security controls, such as signed URLs or user authentication, to ensure that access is restricted to only those who need it.

      "projectEditor: PROJECT-ID",

  {
    "members":[
      "allUsers",
