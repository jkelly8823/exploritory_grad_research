VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Prototype Pollution Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. Prototype pollution occurs when an application allows an attacker to inject properties into the Object.prototype using a technique known as prototype pollution. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties into any object, which can lead to a wide range of attacks, including remote code execution, privilege escalation, and data tampering. In this case, the code is using `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype` to set a property directly on the Object prototype, allowing an attacker to pollute the prototype chain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use a library or function that safely merges objects without exposing the prototype. Avoid using `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype` directly when setting properties on objects. Consider using a more secure method of merging or setting properties, such as using the `Object.assign()` or `Object.create()` methods.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```javascript
setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
```
