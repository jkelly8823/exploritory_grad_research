VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Prototype Pollution and Insecure Property Updates.

EXPLANATION:
The given code function `setValueByPath` allows setting values to nested properties of an object by a dotted path. However, the function does not properly validate and sanitize the input. 

On line 11, the function does not validate the attribute name fully before creating a new object. This can lead to the creation of unintended nested objects. Additionally, the check against attributes resolving to object prototype is incomplete.

Moreover, on line 16, the function directly assigns a value to an object's property. This allows an attacker to pollute the prototype of an object by crafting a malicious input path.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Complete validation of attribute names is recommended. Additional checks should be performed on attribute names before creating new objects or updating their properties.
2. Instead of directly assigning values to properties, consider using `Object.create()` or `Object.defineProperty()` to create new objects or define new properties, respectively. This helps in preventing prototype pollution.
3. Ensure that input paths do not allow escaping or manipulating the prototype chain.
4. Implement defensive programming techniques to prevent potential denials of service or unintended code execution resulting from insecure property updates and prototype pollution.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
function setValueByPath (object, path, value) {
    const pathArray = path.split(".");
    const attributeToSet = pathArray.pop();
    let objectToModify = object;
    for (const attr of pathArray) {
        // Ignore attributes which resolve to object prototype
        if (attr === "__proto__" || attr === "constructor" || attr === "prototype") {
            continue;
        }
        if (typeof objectToModify[attr] !== "object") {
            objectToModify[attr] = {};
        }
        objectToModify = objectToModify[attr];
    }
    objectToModify[attributeToSet] = value;
    return object;
}
```
