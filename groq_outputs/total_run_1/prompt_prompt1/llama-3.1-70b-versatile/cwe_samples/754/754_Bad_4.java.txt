VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a NullPointerException. The 'setInputFile' function is declared to take a String input, but it does not actually assign this input to the 'readFile' File object. The 'readFromFile' function then tries to read from this File object, without checking if it has been properly initialized. 

EXPLANATION:
The problem with this code is that 'readFile' is never initialized. Although 'setInputFile' function is declared to set 'readFile', it doesn't do it. In 'readFromFile', the program tries to create a new 'FileReader' object with 'readFile', and if 'readFile' is null, the 'FileReader' constructor will throw a NullPointerException. Also, it's worth noting that 'setInputFile' should ideally throw an exception if the 'inputFile' parameter is null or an empty string to prevent further problems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Assign 'inputFile' to 'readFile' in 'setInputFile' method. It should handle 'null' and empty strings as well. Consider throwing an exception if the input is invalid.

   ```java
public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
   if (inputFile == null || inputFile.isEmpty()) {
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input file cannot be null or empty.");
   }
   readFile = new File(inputFile);
}
```

2. Initialize 'readFile' with a file path, if required.

3. Check for null before using 'readFile' in 'readFromFile'.

   ```java
public void readFromFile() {
   if (readFile == null) {
       throw new IllegalStateException("Input file has not been set.");
   }
   try {
       reader = new FileReader(readFile);
       // read input file
   } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
private File readFile = null;
public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
    // create readFile File object from string containing name of file
}
public void readFromFile() {
   try {
       reader = new FileReader(readFile);
       // read input file
   } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}
}
```
