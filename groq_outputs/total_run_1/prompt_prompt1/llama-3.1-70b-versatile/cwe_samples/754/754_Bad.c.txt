 Buffer Overflow and Lack of Input Validation 

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to buffer overflow and lack of input validation. Two potential issues have occurred - potential exceeding of static buffer size limits using fgets and excessive data copied with an insecure string copy function. 

The fgets function does not include the null character in the count for which fgets has space for a null character. However, another issue arises in this case. 
The string copy - as performed here is as insecure as gets has been declared to be. 

This presents two potential issues. First potential issue - exceeding of the static buffer limits as set forth for buf and cp_buf and then excessive insecure data copied to cp_buf.

Second potential issue- the excessive data while being copied might overrun the cp_buf buffer with non-checked copied data potentially and then over-run its allocated space.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid buffer overflow and lack of input validation:

1. Use fgets with proper error checking and handling.
2. Set the fgets buffer limit equal to the length of the buffer, and accounting for an extra null character which fgets will append:
   fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin);
   
3. Avoid using strcpy due to the associated security risks. Use strncpy or snprintf instead to copy data into fixed size character arrays/buffers. And always ensure that the nul-terminate null character is appended where a null is a requirement.

    char buf2[20];
    strncpy(buf2, buf, sizeof(buf2)-1);
    buf2[sizeof(buf2)-1] = '\0';

4. Before using a pointer to copy data, check if it is null.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char buf[10], cp_buf[10];fgets(buf, 10, stdin);strcpy(cp_buf, buf);
