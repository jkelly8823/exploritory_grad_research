VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability occurs because the `strcpy` function does not perform any boundary checking on the destination buffer. This means that if the `srcBuf` is longer than the remaining space in `destBuf`, it will overflow the buffer, potentially causing undefined behavior, crashes, or even code injection attacks.

Specifically, the issue lies in the line `strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);`. Here, the function `strcpy` is called with a pointer to a location within the `destBuf` array, and the contents of `srcBuf` without any bounds checking. If `srcBuf` is longer than the remaining space in `destBuf`, it will overwrite adjacent memory locations, causing undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can use the `strncpy` function instead of `strcpy`, and specify the maximum number of characters to copy, to prevent overflowing the buffer. Additionally, you should check the length of `srcBuf` before copying it to ensure it does not exceed the remaining space in `destBuf`.

For example:
```c
size_t remainingSpace = strlen(destBuf) - idx;
size_t srcLen = strlen(srcBuf);
if (srcLen > remainingSpace) {
    // Handle buffer overflow error
} else {
    strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, remainingSpace + 1);
    destBuf[idx + remainingSpace + 1] = '\0'; // ensure null-termination
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
