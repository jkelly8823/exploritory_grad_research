VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Null Pointer Dererference and Out-of-Bounds Access vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The allocation of memory for WidgetList is done based on the user input value numWidgets. However, in line 8, an attempt is made to access and assign a value to `WidgetList[numWidgets]` which is out of the allocated array size. This will cause an out-of-bounds access, potentially resulting in a segmentation fault or a crash. This line of code is intended to set a sentinel value (NULL) at the end of the array for `showWidgets(WidgetList)` function, but the correct approach should be done by checking the actual allocated memory. Furthermore, there is no check if the memory allocation was successful.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace line 8 with a correct array access: Replace the incorrect line with a correct approach to mark the end of the array, e.g., return a value from the InitializeWidget function that can be used as an end indicator by showWidgets function or do not store the NULL value inside the array but have the showWidgets function check the array accessor for NULL value and handle accordingly.
- Add a check for successful memory allocation: Include a check after the malloc statement to handle potential out-of-memory error cases.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int i;
unsigned int numWidgets;
Widget **WidgetList;
numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();
if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {
    ExitError("Incorrect number of widgets requested!");
}
WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));
printf("WidgetList ptr=%p\n", WidgetList);
for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {
    WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();
}
WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;
showWidgets(WidgetList);
```
