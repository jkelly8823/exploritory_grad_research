VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a LDAP injection attack. This occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is directly concatenated into an LDAP search filter.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises in the line where the searchFilter variable is defined. User input, represented by the 'address' variable, is concatenated directly into the LDAP search filter without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the LDAP query and potentially extract or modify sensitive information.

LDAP injection attacks can be particularly severe, as they can provide an attacker with access to sensitive data or allow them to modify existing data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the user's input should be properly sanitized and validated before it is used in the LDAP search filter. Here are some steps to follow:

1.  Use a whitelist to validate the input: Ensure that the 'address' variable only contains valid characters and does not contain any special characters that could be used to manipulate the LDAP query.

2.  Use parameterized queries: If possible, use parameterized queries to separate the query logic from the user's input.

3.  Escape special characters: If parameterized queries are not an option, escape any special characters in the user's input to prevent them from being interpreted by the LDAP server.

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to use parameterized queries:

```java
SearchControls searchCtls = new SearchControls();
searchCtls.setSearchScope(SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE);
String[] attrIDs = { "StreetAddress" };
searchCtls.setReturningAttributes(attrIDs);
String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=<>";
String searchValue = address;
context = new InitialDirContext(env);
Object[] params = new Object[]{searchValue};
NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, params, searchCtls);
```

4.  Consider using a secure coding framework: There are several secure coding frameworks available that can help identify and prevent common security vulnerabilities, including LDAP injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
context = new InitialDirContext(env);
String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address;
NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);
```
