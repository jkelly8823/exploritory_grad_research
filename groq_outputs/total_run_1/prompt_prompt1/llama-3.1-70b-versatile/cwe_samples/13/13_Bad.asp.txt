VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This segment of code contains a clear-text password vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
The clear-text password vulnerability is caused by the presence of the password in plain text within the code. This represents a significant security risk as it could allow unauthorized access to the application's database if the code is ever accessed by an unauthorized party. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should consider the following options:

1. Use environment variables: Store database credentials as environment variables. This will keep the credentials out of your application's codebase.
2. Hash the credentials: At a minimum, hash the password using a secure password hashing algorithm. 
3. Use a secure configuration store: Instead of hardcoding the connection string, store it in a secure configuration store, such as an encrypted file or a secrets manager.
4. Use Integrated Authentication: Instead of using a username and password, use integrated authentication with Windows Authentication or a similar mechanism. This is generally more secure than using a username and password.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  <connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>
