VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability, which occurs when user input is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses the `intval` function to convert the input from the `$_COOKIE["mid"]` to an integer, which might provide some minimal protection against SQL injection attacks. However, this conversion can still be bypassed in certain scenarios such as casting the variable to a string and performing Unicode and hexadecimal attacks. Furthermore, even if the intval function is able to prevent SQL injection attacks in this case, it is still better practice to use parameterized queries whenever possible. 

Moreover, this function does not check the return value of the SQL query to make sure it was successful, and in PHP7.0 the  'mysql_query extension' was deprecated and is removed in PHP7.0.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be achieved using libraries like `mysqli` or `PDO`. Check if the user has the required permissions to query the database. Additionally, the deprecated `mysqli` extension in PHP 7.0 was replaced with `mysqli` and `PDO`. We will be using 'mysqli' below.

```php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name");

$id = $_COOKIE["mid"];
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = ?");

$stmt->bind_param("i", $id); 

$stmt->execute();
$stmt->store_result();
$stmt->bind_result($MessageID, $Subject); 
$stmt->fetch();

$stmt->close();
$mysqli->close();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$id = intval($_COOKIE["mid"]); 
mysql_query("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'");
```

Please replace the host, username, password, and database name in the above solution with your own database information.
