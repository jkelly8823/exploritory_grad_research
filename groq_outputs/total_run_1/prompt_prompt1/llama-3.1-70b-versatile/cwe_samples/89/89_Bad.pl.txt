VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code segment is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. 

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the direct injection of user input ($name) into the SQL query string. Although the code attempts to filter the input using the `allowList` function, the regular expression used may not be sufficient to prevent all possible SQL injection attacks. Furthermore, the `allowList` function itself is not a standard PHP function and its implementation is not shown here. However, even with a well-implemented `allowList` function, it is still possible for a crafted input to bypass the filter. 

Moreover, an even more significant vulnerability arises from the direct injection of `$userKey` and `$name` into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or escaping. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input data. Here's an example of how to use prepared statements with PDO or MySQLi:

For PDO:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO last_names VALUES(:userKey, :name)");
$stmt->bindParam(':userKey', $userKey);
$stmt->bindParam(':name', $name);
$stmt->execute();
```

For MySQLi:

```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO last_names VALUES(?, ?)");
$stmt->bind_param('ss', $userKey, $name);
$stmt->execute();
```

Additionally, consider using a robust validation function to ensure that the user input data conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious characters.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$userKey = getUserID();
$name = getUserInput();
# ensure only letters, hyphens and apostrophe are allowed
$name = allowList($name, "^a-zA-z'-$");
$query = "INSERT INTO last_names VALUES('$userKey', '$name')";
```
