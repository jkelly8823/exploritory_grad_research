VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The code takes user input from a cookie (`$_COOKIE["mid"]`) and directly inserts it into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query by injecting malicious SQL code. For example, if the attacker sets the cookie to `13 OR 1=1`, the query would become `SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '13 OR 1=1'`, which would return all messages instead of just one.

Additionally, the use of `mysql_query` is deprecated and insecure. It is recommended to use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of directly injecting user input into the query.
2. Validate and sanitize user input data before using it in the query.
3. Avoid using deprecated functions like `mysql_query`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$id = $_COOKIE["mid"];
mysql_query("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = '$id'");
```

Note: The following is an example of how the code could be rewritten to prevent SQL injection attacks. This example uses the MySQLi extension and prepared statements:

```php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");

$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT MessageID, Subject FROM messages WHERE MessageID = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("i", $id);
$id = $_COOKIE["mid"];

$stmt->execute();
$stmt->bind_result($messageID, $subject);

$stmt->fetch();

// Do something with the results
```
