VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Data Exposure, Sensitive Data Exposure, and Server-side Request Forgery via unsanitized and unprotected data directly displayed on the page.

EXPLANATION:
This code presents a significant vulnerability as it directly displays sensitive and protected information such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and Credit Card Numbers (CCNs) on the webpage without proper encryption or protection. The use of ERb (Embedded RuBy) syntax (e.g., <%= %> ) indicates that the data is being dynamically generated from server-side variables, which should be protected and encrypted to meet PCI DSS requirements for credit card numbers and HIPAA requirements for protected health information, such as Social Security Numbers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid displaying sensitive and protected information directly on the page unless absolutely necessary.
2. If display of this information is necessary, ensure proper encryption and protection according to the relevant standards and regulations (e.g., PCI DSS for credit card numbers, HIPAA for protected health information).
3. Implement proper storage, handling and transportation of sensitive data.
4. Utilize secure display of masked data to reduce exposure risks.
5. Validate the necessity of keeping this sensitive information and storing it according to relevant security requirements.
