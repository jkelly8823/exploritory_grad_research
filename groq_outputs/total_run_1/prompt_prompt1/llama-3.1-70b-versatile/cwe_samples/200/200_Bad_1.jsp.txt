VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential Debug Information Disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs because the debug mode is enabled based on a user-controlled parameter ("debugEnabled"), which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the system.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the "debugEnabled" parameter is true, and if so, it outputs the user account number. This could potentially reveal sensitive information to an attacker, especially if the debug mode is not properly secured or is accessible to unauthorized users. The use of the system property "debugEnabled" as a conditional statement could also potentially be manipulated by an attacker, allowing them to enable debug mode and gather sensitive information about the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following:
1. Restrict access to debug information: Only allow authorized users to access debug information, and make sure that this information is not accessible to the public.
2. Use a secure method for enabling debug mode: Instead of relying on a user-controlled parameter, use a secure method for enabling debug mode, such as a configuration file or a secure authentication mechanism.
3. Use proper logging mechanisms: Instead of outputting sensitive information directly, use a logging mechanism that logs sensitive information securely and makes it accessible only to authorized users.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  <% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
                        %>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
