VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA (the provided snippet is an error message rather than code)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The error message indicates that a sensitive password is visible in plain text, which is a security vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided snippet is an error message generated by the `mysql_pconnect()` function, indicating that the connection attempt to the database has failed due to an incorrect password. However, this error message exposes sensitive information, including the database username (`root`) and password (`N1nj4`). This type of information should never be visible to unauthorized users, as it can lead to unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Avoid using plain text usernames and passwords in your code. Instead, store them securely in environment variables or encrypted files.
2. Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information. Consider using custom error handling to mask or redact sensitive information.
3. Restrict access to error logs and ensure that they are not stored in publicly accessible locations.
4. Upgrade to a more secure database driver, if possible, and use secure protocols (e.g., `mysqli`) instead of the outdated `mysql` extension.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 Warning: mysql_pconnect(): Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: N1nj4) in /usr/local/www/wi-data/includes/database.inc on line 4

Please note that since the original snippet is an error message and not the actual code, the recommendations provided are general guidelines to improve security in this context.
