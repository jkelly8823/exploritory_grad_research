VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided Perl code does not sanitize user input and uses it directly to query for username and password. It lacks proper input validation and error handling, making it vulnerable to various attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to potential SQL injection and/or command injection attacks. The param function is used to retrieve user input, which is not sanitized or validated. These inputs are passed to functions IsValidUsername and IsValidPassword, which may contain SQL or system commands. An attacker could use this to inject malicious code or escape the intended functionality.

Furthermore, the error messages provided (e.g., "Login Failed - incorrect password" or "Login Failed - unknown username") give potential attackers information on valid usernames, which could be used in a brute force attack to guess the password.

Lastly, the code does not follow secure coding practices such as secure use of functions like param, secure username and password validation checks and etc.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize user input: Use Perl's built-in functions (e.g., lc, normalize) to remove any whitespace, convert to lowercase, and validate the input before passing it to any functions.
2. Validate user input: Ensure that the input conforms to a specified format by using regular expressions or parsing user input.
3. Implement secure password hashing: Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to store and verify password.
4. Use parameterized queries or an ORM: Avoid the use of string concatenated SQL queries to minimize the risk of SQL injection.
5. Avoid providing detailed error messages: Use generic error messages to prevent giving potential attackers valuable information about the system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $username=param('username');
my $password=param('password');

if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
{
                  if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
                  {
                  print "Login Successful";
                  }
                  else
                  {
                  print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
                  }
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
