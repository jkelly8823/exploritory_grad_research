VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code has a vulnerability related to Error Handling and Information Disclosure. Specifically, it catches a general Exception and then echoes sensitive information, including the full exception message and the location of the database configuration file.

EXPLANATION:
When an exception occurs, the code prints the exception message and the location of the database configuration file. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the database configuration, credentials, or the file system of the server. An attacker could use this information to plan a targeted attack or gain unauthorized access to the system.

Furthermore, catching a general Exception can lead to a broad spectrum of error handling issues. It could potentially mask bugs, suppress crucial error information, or even introduce new vulnerabilities by performing incorrect error handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1.  Be more specific when catching exceptions. Instead of catching a general Exception, catch specific exceptions that the code is designed to handle.
2.  Avoid echoing sensitive information. Instead of printing the full exception message and the location of the database configuration file, log this information securely, such as to a file on the server that is not publicly accessible.
3.  Use a more secure error handling mechanism. Instead of simply echoing an error message, consider using a custom error handling class or a logging library to handle and log errors securely.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
try {openDbConnection();}
//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
```
