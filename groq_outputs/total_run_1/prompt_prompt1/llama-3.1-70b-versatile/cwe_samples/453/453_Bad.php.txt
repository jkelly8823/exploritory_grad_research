VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Handling of User Input for Authentication

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates insecure handling of user input for authentication purposes. The variables $user and $pass are directly used in the login_user function, and there is no visible validation or sanitization of this input. This raises concerns about the possibility of authentication bypass or exploitation of potential SQL injection or other injection vulnerabilities if the login_user function does not properly handle the input.

Additionally, the variable $authorized is set based on the result of the login_user function, but it is not clear what measures are taken to prevent an attacker from bypassing or manipulating this authorization check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To improve the security of this code, consider the following recommendations:

1. Validate and sanitize user input: Before processing the user input in the login_user function, validate and sanitize it to prevent potential SQL injection or other injection vulnerabilities.

2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries: Ensure that the login_user function uses prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent injection vulnerabilities.

3. Implement additional security measures: Consider implementing additional security measures such as rate limiting for failed login attempts, session management, and secure password storage.

4. Securely handle authentication result: Ensure that the result of the login_user function is securely handled and cannot be manipulated by an attacker.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
...
if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
