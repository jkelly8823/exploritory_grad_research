VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to direct user input injection and potential authentication bypass attacks.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the `$user` and `$pass` variables are directly assigned values from the `$_POST` superglobal without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input into the `login_user` function. The lack of validation and sanitization increases the risk of authentication bypass attacks or potentially other types of attacks depending on the implementation of `login_user`.

Furthermore, using direct user input without validation or sanitization is a common anti-pattern that can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication bypass attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement input validation and sanitization on the `$user` and `$pass` variables before passing them to the `login_user` function.

Here are some possible ways to fix this code:

1. Validate user input:
```php
$user = filter_var($_POST['user'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
$pass = filter_var($_POST['pass'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```

2. Implement a whitelist approach to restrict the format of the input:
```php
$allowed_chars = '/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/';
if (preg_match($allowed_chars, $_POST['user']) && preg_match($allowed_chars, $_POST['pass'])) {
    $user = $_POST['user'];
    $pass = $_POST['pass'];
    // Proceed with the rest of the logic
} else {
    // Handle input validation error
}
```

3. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with a database to prevent SQL injection:
```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password');
$stmt->bindParam(':username', $user);
$stmt->bindParam(':password', $pass);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
