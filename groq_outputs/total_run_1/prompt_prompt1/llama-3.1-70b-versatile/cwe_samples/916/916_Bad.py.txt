VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code stores user passwords insecurely using MD5 hashing.

EXPLANATION:
The MD5 hashing algorithm used in this code has been widely deprecated due to its susceptibility to collisions and preimage attacks. Moreover, it's an outdated hashing algorithm that can be bruteforced in a matter of seconds, making it inefficient for password storage. This means that an attacker can easily reverse-engineer the hashed password into its original, plaintext form.

Additionally, the code lacks any form of salt or pepper, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. This further exacerbates the insecurity of the password storage mechanism.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upgrade to a more secure hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. Use a library that provides secure password storage, such as passlib or cryptography.
3. Store a random salt along with the hashed password to protect against rainbow table attacks.
4. Consider using an authentication library that provides built-in secure password storage, such as Django's authentication framework or Flask-Login.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def storePassword(userName, Password):
    hasher = hashlib.new('md5')
    hasher.update(Password)
    hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName, hashedPassword)
```
