VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses an insecure hashing algorithm (MD5) and a fixed salt value to store passwords. This is vulnerable to both rainbow table attacks and collision attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses MD5 as the hashing algorithm, which is no longer considered secure for password storage due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. Collision attacks occur when two different inputs produce the same output hash. Additionally, the salt value is fixed ('SaltGoesHere'), which increases the risk of rainbow table attacks. A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions. By using a fixed salt value, the code makes it easier for attackers to create rainbow tables that can be used to reverse the hashed passwords.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a stronger hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. These algorithms are specifically designed to be resistant to collision and rainbow table attacks.
2. Use a random, unique salt value for each user's password. This will help to protect against rainbow table attacks.
3. Iterate the hashing function multiple times to slow down the process and make it more resistant to brute-force attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def storePassword(userName,Password):
    hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')
    hasher.update(Password)
    hashedPassword = hasher.digest()

    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```

Note: Consider using libraries such as `passlib` or `bcrypt` to handle password hashing securely.
