VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is storing sensitive login credentials in plaintext, which can be a serious security vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be configuration settings for an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) connection in a web application. Storing sensitive credentials such as usernames and passwords in plaintext can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security-related issues. Attackers can easily exploit this vulnerability if the configuration file is compromised or accidentally exposed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store credentials securely: Instead of hardcoding credentials in plaintext, consider using environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets management system to store and retrieve sensitive credentials.
2. Use encryption: Encrypt the credentials before storing them, and decrypt them when needed. This will add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.
3. Limit access: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the configuration files, and that access is restricted to a minimum.
