VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Serialization Vulnerability due to attribute assignment in HttpSession object.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the DataGlob class is used to store user data and potentially other sensitive information. When called, the `addToSession` method assigns an instance of this class directly to an HttpSession attribute. HttpSession attributes in Java are serialized, and if an attacker is able to manipulate the session, they could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in deserialization by providing malicious objects. Additionally, storing classes with mutable state in HttpSession objects could lead to unintentional side effects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
When objects are assigned to HttpSession attributes in Java, ensure they are either immutable or carefully validated and sanitized to avoid introducing potential serialization vulnerabilities. 

Recommended fixes: 

* Instead of using instance-level attributes for storing session data, use collections to store your data as collections, as this is safer.
* Use defensive object deserialization for objects retrieved from HttpSession objects, ensuring objects are only accepted if properly validated.
* Avoid mutable static state.
* Do not assign your mutable data classes directly to HttpSession objects.
* Defensive copying is also recommended when pulling data from HttpSession objects and elsewhere.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class DataGlob {
    String globName; String globValue;
    public void addToSession(HttpSession session) {
        session.setAttribute("glob", this);
    }
}
```
