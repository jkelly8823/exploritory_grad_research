VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to inadequate host-based authentication. The code attempts to validate the authenticity of a request by resolving the IP address to a hostname and then checking if the hostname ends with a specific domain name.

EXPLANATION:
The code assumes that if the resolved hostname ends with "trustme.com", the request comes from a trustworthy source. This approach has several issues. Firstly, an attacker can easily spoof the IP address to fake a trusted hostname. Secondly, hostname resolution can be influenced by DNS cache poisoning, which can also enable an attacker to fake a trusted hostname.

Furthermore, even if the hostname resolution process is secure, this approach does not verify that the request is coming from the actual machine with the trusted hostname, which could be used by an attacker. Lastly, an attacker can also exploit any possible vulnerabilities in the DNS system or in the lookup mechanism itself.

Another issue with this code is that it silently fails when the hostname does not match the specific domain. In such cases, the "trusted" variable remains in an indeterminate state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of solely relying on hostname-based authentication, other identification mechanisms, such as certificate-based authentication or secret key-based authentication, should be used to secure connections. Implementing proper input validation and input sanitization should also be considered.

The current implementation's design flaws and vulnerabilities should be addressed by considering other approaches that involve both server-side and client-side authentication and authorization processes. Implementing more secure methods of validation, such as those involving machine-to-machine authentication protocols that consist of handshake mechanisms (like Kerberos), could be an even more effective approach.

To directly fix this issue in this piece of code, implementing an IP whitelisting mechanism as a complement to the current approach could enhance its security. This can include implementing policies for rejecting or flagging suspicious incoming traffic that does not originate from specific IP addresses.

The existing hostname resolution approach may need to be supplemented with complementary methods to prevent spoofing, enhance the reliability of lookups, or adopt DNSSec for lookups.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
    trusted = true;
}
```
