VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code is vulnerable to a resource leak as it does not properly close the PrintWriter and Socket in case of an exception.

EXPLANATION: 
In the given code, the Socket and PrintWriter are not closed in a finally block or using a try-with-resources statement. If an exception occurs during the execution of the code within the try block, the resources will not be closed, potentially leading to resource leaks and sockets being left in an open state.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix the vulnerability, you should use a try-with-resources statement or ensure that the resources are closed in a finally block. The revised code should look something like this:

```java
try (Socket sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);
     PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true)) {
    // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
    ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle the exception.
}
```

Alternatively, if you're not using Java 7 or later, you can use a try-finally block:

```java
Socket sock = null;
PrintWriter out = null;
try {
    sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);
    out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);
    
    // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
    ...
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle the exception.
} finally {
    if (out != null) {
        out.close();
    }
    if (sock != null) {
        try {
            sock.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle the exception.
        }
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
Socket sock;PrintWriter out;
try {
    sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);out = new PrintWriter(echoSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
  
    // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
    ...
}
```
