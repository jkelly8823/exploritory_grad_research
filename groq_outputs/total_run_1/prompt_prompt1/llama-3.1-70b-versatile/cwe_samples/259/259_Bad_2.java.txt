VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4/NA
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded sensitive data in a configuration file.

EXPLANATION:
Storing sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, in plain text within a configuration file is a significant security risk. This information can be accessed by unauthorized parties, either through direct access to the file or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application that lead to file disclosure. If an attacker obtains this sensitve information, they can use it to access critical systems or services, leading to significant data breaches or disruption of services.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we recommend using a secure configuration management approach. Here are a few alternatives:

1. **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables that are only accessible to the application. This way, sensitive data is not hardcoded and is separated from the application code.

2. **Password Vaults or Secret Management Tools:** Store sensitive information in a secure password vault or secret management tool. These tools provide secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information, often with additional features such as encryption and access controls.

3. **Secure External Configuration Files:** Store sensitive information in secure external configuration files that are not committed to version control. This way, sensitive information is separated from the application code and is not accessible to unauthorized parties.

4. **Encryption:** If sensitive information must be stored within the application, consider encrypting the values in the configuration file. This will make it more difficult for an attacker to access the sensitive information.
