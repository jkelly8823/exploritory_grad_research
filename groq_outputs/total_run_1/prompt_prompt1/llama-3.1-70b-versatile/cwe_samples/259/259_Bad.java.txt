VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials make the database vulnerable to unauthorized access.

EXPLANATION:
The code presents a hard-coded username and password, ("scott", "tiger") that are commonly used as default database access credentials for Oracle databases. Hardcoding credentials makes the database vulnerable to unauthorized access in case the code falls into the wrong hands or is found through debugging logs. A malicious actor could use these credentials to gain administrative privileges to the database, compromising its integrity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To minimize this vulnerability, consider using environment variables or secure file storage for the credentials, such that they are not visible in plain text within the source code. Also, rotating and updating credentials after a set period of time or based on changes within the organization can enhance database security. More advanced methods might include impersonation mechanisms or employing an external user management system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  ...DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");...
