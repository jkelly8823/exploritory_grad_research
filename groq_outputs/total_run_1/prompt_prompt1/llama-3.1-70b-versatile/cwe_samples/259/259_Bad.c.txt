VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure comparison of sensitive data (password) using strcmp.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses strcmp to compare the input password with the hardcoded password "Mew!". This approach has two issues: 
1. strcmp returns 0 if the strings match, but the if condition in the code will actually be true if the strings do not match (because of the implicit conversion of the result to a boolean). This means that the condition is incorrectly checking for inequality instead of equality. This might be considered a minor bug, but in combination with the security concerns below, it becomes much more serious.
2. strcmp can be vulnerable to timing attacks. Many platforms will implement strcmp in a way that takes longer to return for characters that are earlier in the alphabet, and earlier in the user-supplied password. A clever attacker might use this information to reconstruct the password, one character at a time.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To fix the bug mentioned above, we should explicitly check for inequality, for instance, if (strcmp(password, "Mew!") == 0) or more idiomatically in C: if (!strcmp(password, "Mew!")).
2. For the timing attack vulnerability, consider using a constant-time comparison function for sensitive data. There are several libraries that offer such functionality.

Here's an example fix:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define a constant-time comparison function for two strings, 
// assuming both have length 'len'.
int constant_time_strcmp(char const * s1, char const * s2, size_t len) {
    int res = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        res |= s1[i] ^ s2[i];
    }
    return res;
}

int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    char admin_password[] = "Mew!";
    if (strlen(password) != strlen(admin_password)) return 0;

    if (constant_time_strcmp(password, admin_password, strlen(password))) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return 0;
    } 
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
    return 1;
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
    if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0)
    }
    printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
}
```
