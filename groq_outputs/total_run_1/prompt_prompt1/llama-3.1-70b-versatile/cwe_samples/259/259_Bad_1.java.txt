VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code contains a hardcoded password vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a hardcoded password ("Mew!") that is directly compared to the user-provided password. This is insecure for several reasons: 
1. Hardcoded passwords are difficult to keep secret and may be easily obtained by attackers with access to the code or reverse engineering of the binary.
2. The use of hardcoded passwords limits the overall security of the system, as all administrators would share the same password.
3. The hardcoded password is short (4 characters) and does not follow standard password security practices.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's recommended to replace the hardcoded password with a secure password storage mechanism, such as storing the hashed version of the password and comparing the hashed version of the user-provided password with it. Also, consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to further improve system security.

ORIGINAL CODE:
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {return(0)}//Diagnostic Modereturn(1);}
