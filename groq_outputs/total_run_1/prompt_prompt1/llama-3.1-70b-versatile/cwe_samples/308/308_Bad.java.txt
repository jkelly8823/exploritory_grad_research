VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Use of SHA for Password Storage

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is using a weak cryptographic algorithm (SHA) to store and compare passwords. SHA is not suitable for password storage due to its high speed and susceptibility to collision attacks. Additionally, there are issues with the digest calculation - it is incorrectly assigned to 'digest' from 'password.digest()'. This could be due to a variable name mistake where 'encer' is used instead of 'password'.

Moreover, the variable 'plainTextIn' is used to update the 'encer' but it is assigned to 'plainText' via a new String. This can potentially allow attackers to compare the two variable values as they are created separately, allowing an attacker to introduce inconsistencies in hashing.

Finally, storing hashed passwords securely typically requires using iterative hashing algorithms like PBKDF2, Bcrypt or Argon2 with high computational overhead to make it more resistant to attacks. Without this, an attacker with physical or logical access to the password database can attempt to reverse-engineer or crack these passwords using rainbow table attacks, brute force attacks or side channel attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use a secure password hashing library that supports well-vetted password hashing algorithms such as PBKDF2, Bcrypt, or Argon2.
Use MessageDigest correctly by using its digest() method.
Use consistent variable names in code to avoid mistakes.

Insecure line 'byte[] digest = password.digest();' should be replaced with:
```java
byte[] digest = encer.digest(plainTextIn);
```

The insecure hash storage and comparison should be changed to something like the following example using BCrypt:
```java
String hashedPassword = BCrypt.hashpw(plainText, BCrypt.gensalt());
if (BCrypt.checkpw(plainText, hashedPassword)) {
    // Valid user
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
```
