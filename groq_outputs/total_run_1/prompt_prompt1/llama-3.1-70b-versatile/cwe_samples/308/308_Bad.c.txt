VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to timing attacks and insecure password storage.

EXPLANATION:
The code is using the "equal" function to compare two hashes. However, this function is likely to be comparing the hashes in a way that is vulnerable to timing attacks. A timing attack can be used to determine the length of the shared prefix between the two hashes, allowing an attacker to determine the hash value. Additionally, the use of 'sha1' is a weak hashing algorithm that is no longer secure for storing passwords. Finally, the use of 'simple_digest' with 'sha1' and a secret password suggests that the password is being hardcoded and stored in plaintext, which is insecure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following changes are recommended:
1. Use a secure hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 to store passwords. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.
2. Compare hashes using a constant time comparison function to prevent timing attacks. This function should compare the two hashes bit by bit, and not return until all bits have been compared.
3. Avoid hardcoding passwords or storing them in plaintext. Instead, store a hashed and salted version of the password.
4. Avoid using weak hashing algorithms like 'sha1' for storing passwords.

ORIGINAL CODE:
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
        login_user();
    }
}
