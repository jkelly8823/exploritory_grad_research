VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This function is vulnerable to a remote file inclusion vulnerability and has weak authorization checks.

EXPLANATION:
The provided function reads the contents of a file using the file_get_contents() function and returns it to the user if the user is the owner of the file. However, the $filename variable is not validated, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious input. If the function is called remotely, this could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. For example, if the attacker provides '/etc/passwd' as the filename, they can retrieve the system's password file.

Another vulnerability is the fact that the 'isOwnerOf' function is not shown, and it is assumed that it is implemented securely. However, it may introduce additional security risks if not implemented properly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper file name validation: Before reading the file, validate that the filename is within a safe directory and is a file that can be accessed by the application.
2. Restrict access to directories: Ensure that the system is correctly configured so that the web server does not have access to sensitive directories.
3. Implement secure authorization checks: Ensure that the 'isOwnerOf' function is implemented correctly and that it performs robust authorization checks. It should check the ownership of the file and verify that it's accessible to the user before allowing access.
4. Always use absolute file paths and/or whitelisting: Use a known safe base directory when constructing the filename to avoid vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
function printFile($username,$filename){
    //read file into string
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
