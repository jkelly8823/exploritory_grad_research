VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
DoubleCloseOperationDouble

EXPLANATION:
This segment of code is vulnerable to a double free operation. Specifically, the fclose() function is called twice on the same file pointer. This is problematic because when fclose() is called, the resources associated with the file stream are released. If fclose() is called twice, the second call will attempt to release resources that have already been released, leading to undefined behavior. This issue can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, remove the second fclose() call. This call is unnecessary and introduces the vulnerability. Only call fclose() once, when you're done using the file.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char b[2000];
FILE *f = fopen("dbl_cls.c", "r");
if (f)
{
    b[0] = 0;
    fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);
    printf("%s\n'", b);
    int r1 = fclose(f);
    printf("\n-----------------\n1 close done '%d'\n", r1);
    int r2 = fclose(f);    // Double close
    printf("2 close done '%d'\n", r2);
}
```
