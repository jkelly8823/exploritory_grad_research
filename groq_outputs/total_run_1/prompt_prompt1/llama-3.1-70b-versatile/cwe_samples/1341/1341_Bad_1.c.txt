VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: /NA (code not numbered, also the snippet is not fully represented in a single code block), however the issue can be identified in the use of 'free(ptr)' after the conditional statement.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double-Free Vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
The issue lies in the use of 'free(ptr)' in two separate instances: once after the conditional check for 'abrt' and once outside of it. This can potentially lead to freeing the same pointer twice. When this happens, the application's memory becomes corrupted. If an attacker is able to control the execution flow (e.g., by controlling 'abrt' variable), they can trigger a double-free, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, you can ensure that 'free(ptr)' is only called once. You can achieve this by setting the 'ptr' to NULL after freeing it. Here is a revised version of the code:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
//... your code here
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
}
// ... rest of your code here
if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
}
```

Alternatively, you can consider moving the second 'free(ptr)' inside the 'else' block of 'abrt' check:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
//... your code here
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
} else {
    // ... rest of your code here
    free(ptr);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
```
