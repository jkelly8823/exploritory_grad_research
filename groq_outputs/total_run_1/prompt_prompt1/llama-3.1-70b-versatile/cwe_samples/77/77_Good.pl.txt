VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to regex denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks.
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `^\w[\w\-]+$` is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks because it contains nested quantifiers and character classes that can be easily exploited by an attacker. The `\w` character class matches word characters, and the `+` quantifier allows for multiple repeats. An attacker can craft a malicious input string that causes the regex engine to take an excessive amount of time to process, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent ReDoS attacks, it's recommended to use anchored regex patterns, avoid nested quantifiers, and use possessive quantifiers if possible. Here's an example of a revised regex pattern that mitigates the ReDoS vulnerability:

```perl
if ($name =~ /\A[\w-]+\z/) ...
```

This revised pattern uses the `\A` and `\z` anchors to ensure the regex engine only matches the entire string, and the possessive quantifier `()+` is not necessary in this case. However, note that this is a simplification and the original regex might have been designed to allow for more complex input patterns.

ORIGINAL CODE:


if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) ...
