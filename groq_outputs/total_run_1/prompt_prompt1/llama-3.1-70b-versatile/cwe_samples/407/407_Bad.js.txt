VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The variable "test_string" contains user-defined input, however the pattern used in the regex "bad_pattern" does not adequately filter out all potentially malicious input. Certain special characters and non-word characters can still pass through this filter.

EXPLANATION:
In JavaScript, certain regex patterns are vulnerable to ReDoS attacks if they contain matching patterns which force the regex engine to recursively call itself. Here, the regex pattern "bad_pattern" uses "\w+" which matches one or more alphanumeric characters, and it uses a lazy "*?" quantifier which can lead to recursion. Although this particular scenario doesn't contain an extremely complex or deep recursion which is typically a requirement for ReDoS attacks, the use of "?", "+" and "*" could still potentially allow for the construction of a DoS attack.

Additionally, the regex pattern is incomplete, and may not catch all malicious special characters and bad input patterns, leading to potential injection attacks. This is because the pattern "bad_pattern" doesn't accurately validate, or reject malicious inputs in "test_string", i.e., inputs that contain any characters other than those that the regex specifies.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To make the code more secure, we should limit user input, verifying that only specific, acceptable values are allowed, the checking of regex should be conducted with extreme care to prevent recursively excessive use. Ensure any regular expressions are vetted before being pushed to production and set proper anchors at the start and end to ensure the pattern must match fully.

   If allowed change this, i.e., consider changing "\w" (alphanumeric characters plus "_ ")
 by setting what is allowed, i.e., "ascii" A-Z, a-z, 0-9.  Always explicitly exclude characters rather than, assuming all other values aren't ever included:
regex example:  /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/


A better check for this test, using certain "string tests":

   function validate(var_input){
    return (/^[a-zA-Z0-9 \t\n\r\f\v]*$/.test(input));
}
 Call as: validate(bad_pattern);

Test validate(var_input String) with Strings such as, i.e. "1002 ASD"
 

ORIGINAL CODE:
               var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
               var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
               var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
