VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. It prints the connection string to the console, which includes sensitive database credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The code is securely storing the database credentials in a string variable `cs`, but it is then printing this string to the console using `Console.Writeline(cs)`. This means that anyone with access to the console output of the program can see the database credentials, including the server name, database name, and potentially the username and password. This is a serious security vulnerability, as an attacker could use this information to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the connection string should be stored securely and not printed to the console. Instead, the connection string should be read from a secure configuration file, such as a web.config or app.config file, or a secure environment variable. This way, even if an attacker gains access to the console output of the program, they will not be able to see the database credentials.

Additionally, consider using a secure way to store sensitive data such as Entity Framework Core's "User Secrets" or Azure Key Vault.

ORIGINAL CODE:
string cs="database=northwind; server=mySQLServer...";SqlConnection conn=new SqlConnection(cs);...Console.Writeline(cs);
