VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an IP spoofing attack and insecure redirection.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` to get the IP address of the client making the request. However, this value can be easily spoofed using techniques like a proxy server or VPN. A malicious user could potentially spoof the IP address to bypass the IP address check. Furthermore, the code redirects the user to another page using `http_redirect($errorPageURL)` without validating the `$errorPageURL` variable. This could potentially lead to an open redirect vulnerability if the `$errorPageURL` variable is not properly sanitized.

Additionally, the code prints the status of the server using `echo $status`. However, there is no validation on the status before printing it out, potentially exposing internal server details.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use more reliable IP detection methods: Use a combination of `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']` and `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` to detect the IP address of the client.
2. Validate the `$errorPageURL` variable: Use a whitelist of allowed URLs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
3. Sanitize the `$status` variable: Validate and escape the `$status` variable to prevent disclosure of internal server details.
4. Use HTTPS for secure redirection: Use `https_redirect` instead of `http_redirect` to prevent eavesdropping and tampering during the redirection process.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
```
