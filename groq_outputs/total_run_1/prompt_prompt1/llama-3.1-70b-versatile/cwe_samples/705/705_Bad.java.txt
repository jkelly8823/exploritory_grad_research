VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A DNS Rebinding Vulnerability exists in this code due to the use of InetAddress.getByName(ip) followed by addr.getHostName() which can lead to resolving a malicious IP address to a hostname within the target's internal network.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the IP address from the request to resolve the hostname using InetAddress.getByName(ip) and then printing the hostname. However, if the IP address in the request is not validated properly, an attacker can manipulate the IP address and send it to a malicious IP that resolves to a hostname within the target's internal network, thus bypassing internal network restrictions. This can potentially allow an attacker to gather internal information that would be not accessible otherwise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend to never use the InetAddress.getByName(ip) with an untrusted IP address, especially one received from an HTTP request. 

A better approach is to use a different method to identify the client requesting your resource. For example, you could set the hostname based on your domain name. 

Here's a safer implementation:

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
    String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();    
    String hostname = "example.com"; // Your server's fixed hostname
    out.println("hello " + hostname);
}
```

Alternatively, you can also validate the IP address using allow or denylists (white or blacklists) based on your application requirements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());}
```
