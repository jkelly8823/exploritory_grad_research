VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability and Auth Bypass Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attack because the $filename variable is directly passed to the file_get_contents function without any proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially traverse the file system and access sensitive files.

Additionally, the $username is not validated and is solely relied upon for authorization. This could potentially lead to Auth Bypass Vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the $username value.

It is also worth noting that the code uses a single line for multiple statements, which is against the best practices for code readability and maintainability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a whitelist of allowed file paths and extensions to prevent path traversal.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the $filename and $username variables.
3. Use a more secure authorization mechanism to prevent Auth Bypass Vulnerability.
4. Follow best practices for code readability and maintainability, and separate multiple statements into their own lines.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    //read file into string
    $file = file_get_contents($filename); //This line is particularly vulnerable
    if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
        echo $file;
        return true;
    }else{
        echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
    }
    return false;
}
```
A potential secure implementation of this function could look like this:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    $allowedExtensions = array('txt', 'pdf', 'doc');
    $allowedDirectories = array('/user_files/', '/public_files/');

    // Validate and sanitize the $filename variable
    $filename = realpath($filename);
    if (substr($filename, 0, strlen($allowedDirectories[0])) === $allowedDirectories[0] &&
        in_array(pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION), $allowedExtensions)) {
        if (isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
            echo file_get_contents($filename);
            return true;
        } else {
            echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
        }
    } else {
        echo 'Invalid file path';
    }
    return false;
}
```
