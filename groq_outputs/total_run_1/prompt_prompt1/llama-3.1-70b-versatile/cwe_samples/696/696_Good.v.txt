VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability in the grant access control mechanism. The password or ID used for granting access to data_out is hardcoded and easily discoverable.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference when granting access to data_out based on the usr_id. The hardcoded value (3'h4) used to authenticate access can be easily guessed or discovered through reverse engineering, allowing unauthorized access to the data_out.

Furthermore, the variable grant_access is assigned a value in a manner that is easily reverse engineerable by viewing the code. The user of the module might expect that this could never be known, and a user of the module would certainly expect it not to have a hardcoded value.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the hardcoded usr_id value with a securely generated key or token that can be verified through secure means, such as from a securely stored database or an authentication module. Additionally, implement a more secure authentication and authorization mechanism that doesn't expose sensitive information. It would be better to add support for modification of the authenticated user ID. To prevent reverse engineering of easily readable Verilog, consider what HDL (verilog, VHDL, etc.) code might look like when compiled. Always test after synthesis of HDL with netlist analysis techniques.
ORIGINAL CODE:


       			always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
       			begin
			    
				  if (!rst_n)
				  
					data_out = 0;
				  
				  else
				  
					assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
					data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
				  
			    
			    end
       			endmodule
