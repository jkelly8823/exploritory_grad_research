VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential "Resource Leak" vulnerability exists in this code. 

EXPLANATION:
The code is attempting to create a database connection using the DriverManager.getConnection() method, but it is not properly handling potential resource leaks. If an exception occurs after the DriverManager.getConnection() method call, the connection object (con) will not be closed, resulting in a resource leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the resource leak vulnerability, consider using a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the connection object, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. Here's how you can modify the code:
```java
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string)) {
    // Perform database operations
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(e);
}
```
This way, the connection object will be automatically closed at the end of the try block, preventing a resource leak.

ORIGINAL CODE:
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}
