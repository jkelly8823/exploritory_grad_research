VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a Division by Zero vulnerability in the function `rec_big`. 

EXPLANATION:
The function `rec_big` performs two divisions: one by `y` and another by `z`. Both of these divisions could potentially divide by zero if `y` or `z` are zero. The initial values for `y` and `z` appear to be non-zero, but this does not prevent future callers of `rec_big` from passing zero. 

A division by zero could result in a panic that causes the program to terminate. Depending on the context in which this function is used, this could potentially be used as a denial-of-service attack vector.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to add checks for `y` and `z` being zero before performing the divisions. Here's how you could modify the `rec_big` function to add these checks:
```rust
fn rec_big(y: BigRational, z: BigRational) -> Result<BigRational, &'static str> {
    if y.is_zero() {
        return Err("Cannot divide by zero!");
    }
    if z.is_zero() {
        return Err("Cannot divide by zero!");
    }
    Ok(
        BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(108))
        - ((BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(815))
        - BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(1500)) / z)
        / y)
    )
}
```
Alternatively, you could use the `checked_div` or `safe_div` methods provided by some `BigRational` libraries.

Also, you should modify the calls to `rec_big` to handle these potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```rust
    Use num_rational::BigRational;

    fn rec_big(y: BigRational, z: BigRational) -> BigRational
    {
    BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(108))
    - ((BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(815))
    - BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(1500)) / z)
    / y)
    }
    
    fn big_calc(turns: usize) -> BigRational 
    {
    let mut x: Vec<BigRational> = vec![BigRational::from_float(4.0).unwrap(), BigRational::from_float(4.25).unwrap(),];
    
    (2..turns + 1).for_each(|number| 
    {
    x.push(rec_big(x[number - 1].clone(), x[number - 2].clone()));
    });
    x[turns].clone()
    }
```
