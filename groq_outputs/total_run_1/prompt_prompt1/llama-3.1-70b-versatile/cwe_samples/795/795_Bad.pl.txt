VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The variable `$Username` is retrieved from an untrusted source `GetUntrustedInput()`, and then sanitized using a regular expression to remove any leading "../" sequences. However, the sanitization is insufficient, as an attacker could still provide a string that, when concatenated with the fixed path "/home/user/", would allow them to access arbitrary directories. For example, if the attacker provides a string like "foo/../../../etc/passwd", the resulting `$filename` would point to the system's password file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following:

* Implement more robust sanitization and validation of the `$Username` variable, considering all possible cases that could lead to a path traversal attack.
* Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific values for `$Username` that do not contain any special characters or path separators.
* Consider using a library or framework that provides a more secure way of handling file paths and directory access.
* Avoid using the `.` and `..` notation in file paths, as it can lead to confusion and security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/^\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
               
Note: This vulnerability analysis assumes that the `GetUntrustedInput()` function retrieves input from an external, untrusted source, such as a user input field.
