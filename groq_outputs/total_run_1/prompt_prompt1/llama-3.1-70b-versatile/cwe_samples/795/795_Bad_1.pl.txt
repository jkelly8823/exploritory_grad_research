VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory by manipulating the input provided to the `$Username` variable. The input is not properly sanitized before being used to construct the file path. Although the code attempts to mitigate this vulnerability by removing any occurrences of '../' at the beginning of the `$Username`, it does not address the case where '../' is used at the end or in the middle of the string. Additionally, the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the input can still lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input.
2. Validate that the provided input only contains characters that are expected (e.g., alphanumeric characters).
3. Consider using a whitelisting approach to limit the input to only allowed characters.
4. Replace the concatenation of the path with a secure method that resists path traversal attacks, such as using a framework that provides secure file handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput(); if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') { $Username = substr($Username, 3); } my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username; ReadAndSendFile($filename);
