VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: NA ( Cannot directly identify specific lines as the code snippet is incomplete, but the vulnerabilities exist in these lines)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A resource leak and possible NullPointerException vulnerability exist in this code snippet. 

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not include error handling for potential NullPointerExceptions that can occur if the property "sub" is not found or if the fis.read(arr) operation fails. Furthermore, the FileInputStream 'fis' is not properly closed in case of an exception, causing a resource leak. 

Additionally, if 'cfg' is null or if 'cfg.getProperty("sub")' returns null, a NullPointerException can be thrown when attempting to concatenate '.txt'. 

Lastly, 'fis.read(arr)' may return -1 if the end of the file is reached, which can result in 'amt' being -1. This can potentially lead to problems down the line if the value of 'amt' is used in subsequent operations without being properly checked.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, use try-catch blocks for exception handling and make sure to close the FileInputStream in a finally block to prevent resource leaks. It's also important to validate and check for null values before using variables. Here is a more secure version of the code:

```java
try {
    String sub = cfg.getProperty("sub");
    if (sub == null) {
        throw new Exception("Property 'sub' not found.");
    }
    fis = new FileInputStream(sub + ".txt");
    amt = fis.read(arr);
    out.println(arr);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle IOException
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle Exception
} finally {
    if (fis != null) {
        try {
            fis.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle IOException during close
        }
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```
fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt");amt = fis.read(arr);out.println(arr);
```
