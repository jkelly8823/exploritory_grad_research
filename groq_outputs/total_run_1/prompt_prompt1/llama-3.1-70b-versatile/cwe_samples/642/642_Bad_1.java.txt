VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and Unvalidated Redirect vulnerabilities present due to use of untrusted input in file operations.

EXPLANATION:
The code presented uses untrusted input (`request.getParameter("reportName")`) in constructing a file path. This input is not sanitized or validated before being concatenated to a base path. As a result, an attacker can manipulate the `reportName` parameter to access or delete any file on the system that the application has access to. For example, an attacker could set the `reportName` parameter to `../../../etc/passwd` (on Unix-based systems) or `..\..\Windows\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Boot.ini` (on Windows-based systems) to access sensitive system files.

Additionally, since the file is being deleted, this can also be used to delete important system files, leading to significant disruptions to system operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user input: Perform thorough validation and sanitization on the `reportName` parameter to prevent any malicious inputs. This includes checking the length, allowed characters, and format of the input.
2. Use a whitelist: Instead of letting the user specify the report name, provide a list of allowed report names or ids and let the user select from them.
3. Use a secure method for file access: Instead of directly accessing files based on user input, use a more secure method such as using a resource-based approach where the file is identified by a unique id or token.
4. Implement proper access control: Use proper access control to restrict access to files and prevent any potential exploitation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
... 
rFile.delete();
