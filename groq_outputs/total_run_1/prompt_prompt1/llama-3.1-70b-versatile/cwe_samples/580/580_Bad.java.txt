VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to object cloning. The Kibitzer class has a clone method that creates a new instance of itself directly, instead of calling Object's clone method, which can lead to inconsistent state in subclasses.

EXPLANATION:
The problem arises because the Kibitzer class does not call the Object's clone method, but instead creates a new instance of itself. This can cause issues when subclasses of Kibitzer override the clone method. When they call super.clone(), they will get a clone of the Kibitzer instance, not a new instance of the subclass. This is what's happening in the FancyKibitzer class, which can lead to inconsistent state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this, the Kibitzer class should call Object's clone method to ensure that the correct type of object is created. Here's an updated version of the Kibitzer class:

```java
public class Kibitzer implements Cloneable {
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

By calling super.clone(), we ensure that the correct type of object is created, whether it's Kibitzer or a subclass like FancyKibitzer. Also, note that we're implementing the Cloneable interface, because Object's clone method checks if the class implements Cloneable before cloning.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class Kibitzer {
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = new Kibitzer();...
    }
}
public class FancyKibitzer extends Kibitzer{
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = super.clone();...
    }
}
```
