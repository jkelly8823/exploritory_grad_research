VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The method `getRSACipher` catches exceptions and handles them in an inadequate manner. Instead of properly propagating or handling these exceptions in a production environment, it logs an error message that indicates this "should never happen" and then continues with the execution of the program, potentially causing unknown behavior.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, the exceptions `NoSuchAlgorithmException` and `NoSuchPaddingException` are caught and logged as a critical error with a message saying "this should never happen". This approach to exception handling makes it difficult to identify and fix the root cause of this problem since it doesn't notify the calling code about what went wrong. If an exception of this kind does occur, the calling method has no way of knowing that something went wrong and will just be passed a null Cipher object. 

This lack of proper exception handling can lead to a situation where the Cipher object returned is null, and subsequent code can throw a `NullPointerException`, potentially concealing the root cause of the issue. 

Additionally, hard-coding the error message "this should never happen" may give the developers a false sense of security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of catching exceptions in this method and logging them, consider either:
- Propagating these exceptions by re-throwing them after logging, so that they can be handled by the calling code.
- Specify a clear, defined behavior when exceptions occur, so that the program is not left in an unknown state.
- If you want to make these exceptions be handled within this method itself, ensure you restore your object into a valid state after handling these exceptions.

Here's an example of better exception handling for this situation:

```java
public Cipher getRSACipher() {
    Cipher rsa = null;
    try {
        rsa = javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance("RSA/NONE/NoPadding");
        if (rsa == null) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to get RSA cipher instance");
        }
    } catch (java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException | javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException e) {
        log("Error getting RSA cipher instance", e);
        // You can either re-throw the exception, or handle the condition inside the catch block.
        // Re-throwing the exception example:
        throw new RuntimeException("Error getting RSA cipher instance", e);
    }
    return rsa;
}
```
Alternatively, you can return Optional in Java or a similar wrapper in other languages:
```java
public Optional<Cipher> getRSACipher() {
    try {
        Cipher rsa = javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance("RSA/NONE/NoPadding");
        return Optional.of(rsa);
    } catch (java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException | javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException e) {
        log("Error getting RSA cipher instance", e);
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public Cipher getRSACipher() {Cipher rsa = null;try {rsa = javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance("RSA/NONE/NoPadding");}catch (java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {log("this should never happen", e);}catch (javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException e) {log("this should never happen", e);}return rsa;}
```
