VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: All lines with 'free(ptr)'
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a double-free vulnerability. This occurs when the same block of memory is freed multiple times, which can lead to undefined behavior and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the 'ptr' is freed if 'abrt' is true, but it is also freed later regardless of the value of 'abrt'. If 'abrt' is true, the 'ptr' will be freed twice, which is a double-free vulnerability. This is because 'free(ptr)' is called twice, once in the if block and again outside the if block.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the second call to 'free(ptr)' should be wrapped in a null check to ensure that 'ptr' is not freed twice. Here is an example of the fixed code:
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // set ptr to NULL to prevent double-free
}
...
if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
}
```
Alternatively, you could restructure the code to ensure that 'free(ptr)' is only called once. This would eliminate the possibility of a double-free vulnerability.
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (ptr != NULL) {
    if (abrt) {
        free(ptr);
    } else {
        // use ptr here
        free(ptr);
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
}
...
free(ptr);
```
