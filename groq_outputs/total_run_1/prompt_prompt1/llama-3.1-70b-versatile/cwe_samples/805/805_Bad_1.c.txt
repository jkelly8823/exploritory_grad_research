VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow and Out-Of-Bounds Read

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet lacks complete implementation details of the returnChunkSize function, but the manner in which it is being used in the main function introduces potential security vulnerabilities. 

By subtracting 1 from the return value of returnChunkSize(destBuf), the code is attempting to account for the null-terminator character when dealing with strings. However, this approach does not guard against integer overflows, and it also neglects to account for the potential size value of -1 that the function indicates as an error. 

Such uses often result in a -2 size value being passed to memcpy, potentially causing an out-of-bounds read, or undefined behavior if it overflows the integer type it was cast to.

Moreover, even when the returnChunkSize function returns a non-error value, using it with such arbitrary correction(-1) to determine buffer size for memcpy operations could potentially introduce buffer overflows. This can happen if the destination buffer is not as large as the copied data.

Additionally, because destBuf and srcBuf are not sanitized before being used with memcpy and returnChunkSize functions, they can hold any values and point anywhere in memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability:

1. Implement bounds checking in the returnChunkSize function to ensure valid return values.

2. Correctly determine the required size for the destination buffer when performing the memcpy.

3. Ensure both source and destination buffers are correctly initialized, and null checks are performed before using them with returnChunkSize and memcpy.

4. Validate data before passing to returnChunkSize.

The code should account for cases where the return value is -1 and for cases where the size returned exceeds the actual capacity of the destination buffer, thus ensuring there are no out-of-bounds reads or buffer overflows. This might involve utilizing safer functions for copying, such as strncpy_s in C.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int returnChunkSize(void *) {
    ...
} int main() {... memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
```
