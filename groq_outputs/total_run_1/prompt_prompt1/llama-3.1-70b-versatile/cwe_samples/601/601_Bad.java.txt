VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Redirect, also known as Open Redirect, is present in this code. This allows an attacker to manipulate the URL parameter to redirect a victim to a malicious website.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a vulnerability where the 'url' parameter is directly retrieved from the request query string and then used to redirect the user without proper validation. This can be exploited by an attacker by crafting a URL with a malicious 'url' parameter to redirect the victim to their own site, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware installation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper validation and whitelisting for the redirect URLs. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the redirect URL is one of the pre-approved, trusted URLs. Additionally, consider using a safe redirect approach where you redirect to a relative URL within your own application, or use a controller method to handle redirects.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public class RedirectServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String query = request.getQueryString();
        if (query.contains("url")) {
            String url = request.getParameter("url");
            response.sendRedirect(url);
        }
    }
}
