VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Cookie Creation

EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to insecure cookie creation. When creating a new Cookie object, it is essential to configure the cookie with the 'secure' and 'httponly' flags. The 'secure' flag ensures that the cookie is transmitted over a secure protocol (HTTPS) and the 'httponly' flag restricts JavaScript access to the cookie, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. However, in this code snippet, these flags are not set, making the cookie vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the 'secure' and 'httponly' flags should be enabled when creating the Cookie object. Here's how to do it:

Cookie cookie = new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID);
cookie.setSecure(true);
cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
response.addCookie(cookie);

ORIGINAL CODE:
response.addCookie( new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID);
