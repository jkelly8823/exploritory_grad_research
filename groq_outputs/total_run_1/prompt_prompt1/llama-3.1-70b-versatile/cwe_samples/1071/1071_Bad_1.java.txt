VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Synchronization on this Object is not secure.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is synchronizing on the this object, which is not secure. This can lead to Deadlocks or other synchronization-related issues, because the this object can be also used for synchronization by other classes when your class is subclassed, or when other objects synchronize on it directly. It also can lead to a "Non-final Lock" issue, a synchronized block on a non-final field or object is fragile, because other classes may be synchronizing on the same object, then modifying it, thereby introducing a race condition and making the lock fragile.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Synchronize on a private final field instead. 
- Synchronize methods if they are to be used as instance methods. Do not mix public synchronized methods (if there are any) with synchronized blocks on the private lock object.
- Ensure that nested synchronized methods and blocks are synchronized on distinct objects if nested synchronization is unavoidable.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  synchronized(this) { }
