VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hard-coded sensitive information vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided loads a configuration file and retrieves a password from it, then uses that password to establish a database connection. However, the code does not handle the password securely, and there are signs that it could be using hard-coded or non-validated input to load sensitive information. The biggest issue here is that, though the password itself is not hard-coded in the java code presented, the connection clearly is retrieving that value without any encryption or hashing. 
Moreover, this can easily allow an attacker to leak the configuration file to extract clear text passwords, with it potentially not following best practices. 
 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit access to the configuration file ("config.properties") and ensure it's encrypted. 
2. Implement a secure mechanism for managing sensitive configuration data. 
3. Use secure password storage and comparison. Never store clear-text passwords; use argon2id like libraries, to ensure that all passwords have been hashed using a sufficiently hard memory password hashing algorithm, PBKDF2 can be used too, which might make it simpler for a user, like storing the related work factors, each one is different and never reused because part of the given hash, since code version dependent and updated information can differ the work factor count, resulting in different hashes and the inability to reproduce results easily.
 
4. Avoid using Properties file and hard-coded secrets to store sensitive info. Instead, look for alternatives like loading them from environment variables or using Secrets Managers like HashiCorp's Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or AWS Secrets Manager.
