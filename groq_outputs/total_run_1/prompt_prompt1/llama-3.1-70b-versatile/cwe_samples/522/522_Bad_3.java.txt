VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be from a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file. The vulnerability lies in lines 3-4, where sensitive information (LDAP username and password) is hardcoded directly into the properties file. This is a significant security risk as it exposes the credentials to unauthorized access. If the properties file is accessed by an attacker, they can obtain the sensitive information and use it to authenticate to the LDAP service, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive information instead of hardcoding it directly into the properties file. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Remove the hardcoded credentials from the properties file.
2. Store the credentials in environment variables or a secure secrets management system, such as HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
3. Update the properties file to reference the environment variables or use a secure mechanism to retrieve the credentials from the secrets management system.
