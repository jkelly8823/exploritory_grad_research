VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1/1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials

EXPLANATION:
The given segment of code contains a hardcoded database connection string with plain-text username and password, making it a high-risk vulnerability. If an attacker gains access to this configuration file, they can obtain the database credentials, allowing them to access the database and potentially exploit sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, do not hardcode database credentials in the code or configuration file. Instead, store sensitive information such as database passwords securely using environment variables or a secrets management system like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp's Vault. 
Replace the hardcoded credentials with placeholders or environment variables.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
