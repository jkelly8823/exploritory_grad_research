VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential SQL Injection, Insufficient Access Control, or Information Exposure Vulnerability due to insecure coding practices for role-based access control.

EXPLANATION:
The code presented has a method `accessGranted(String resource, String user)` that takes a user and checks their roles against administrative roles for a certain resource. However, the function call is incorrect as the return type of both methods is `private boolean void` instead of `private boolean`. Moreover, the method 'accessGranted(String resource, String user)' contains hardcoded administrative roles but it calls `accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles)` passing `ADMIN_ROLES`. If the hardcoding of `ADMIN_ROLES` is not subject to proper validation and sanitization, a code injection or an information exposure vulnerability may occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update the method return types to match. Here, I'll assume you want a `private boolean` return type.
2. Pass secure, validated user roles rather than hardcoded administrative roles.

Here is the updated version of your code. 

```java
private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...; 

private boolean accessGranted(String resource, String user) { 
   String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user); 
   return accessGranted(resource, userRoles); 
} 

private boolean accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
   if (userRoles == null) {
      throw new NullPointerException("User roles must not be null.");
   }
   
   // grant or deny access based on user roles
   // ... 
} 

// Usage example with validation of user roles:
private String[] getUserRoles(String user) {
   // implement secure, validated user role retrieval here
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...; 
public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user) { 
   String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user); 
   return accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES);
} 
private boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
   
    // grant or deny access based on user roles
   ...
}
```
