VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Input Validation Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a part of a form validation system, and it defines rules for various form fields. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the regular expressions (regex) used for input validation are not properly anchored. This allows an attacker to bypass the validation by entering a string that matches the regex pattern but has additional malicious characters.

For example, in the "state" field, the regex pattern `[a-zA-Z]{2}` only checks if the input string starts with two alphabetic characters, but it does not prevent additional characters from being appended. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if the input is not further validated. Similarly, the "zipcode" field's regex pattern `\d{5}` only checks if the input string contains exactly five digits, but it does not prevent non-digit characters from being appended.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the regex patterns to properly anchor the input. For example:

- For the "state" field, use `^[a-zA-Z]{2}$` to ensure that the input string contains exactly two alphabetic characters and no additional characters.
- For the "zipcode" field, use `^\d{5}$` to ensure that the input string contains exactly five digits and no additional characters.

Additionally, it is recommended to implement further validation and sanitization on the input data to prevent unexpected behavior or security issues.
