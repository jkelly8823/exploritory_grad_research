VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Index Out of Bounds Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment is vulnerable to an Index Out of Bounds vulnerability. The code catches the IndexOutOfBoundsException that can be thrown by the get method of the ArrayList class but does not handle it properly. Instead of completely avoiding the exception, it should be caught and managed to prevent exploitations of the situation. 

Moreover, this exception handling could result in hiding the bug. Rather than fixing the logic to not access the index beyond the bounds of available indices, it just silently fails, masking the problem. Also, if an attacker knew the productArray had indices larger than MAX_PRODUCTS, they might be able to leverage this lack of input validation to execute attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate all array indices against the ArrayList's bounds before attempting to access the element. This can be done by comparing the index against productArray.size().
2. Use the size method provided by ArrayList to make sure the index does not exceed the number of elements it contains.
3. Prevent potential abuse by terminating immediately when encountering a boundary that doesn't abide by the size expectation.
4. This could be re-written as "try { if (index < 0 || index > productArray.size()) { ... handle exception ...  } catch ( no exception ) ", though don't catch if the error code was going to be ignored - silently failing usually just helps hide errors, don't catch unless you resolve this issue then and there.

ORIGINAL CODE:
ArrayList productArray = new ArrayList(MAX_PRODUCTS); 
... 
try { 
    productSummary = (String) productArray.get(index); 
} 
catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {...}
