VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Predictable Random Number Generation Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `Random` class with a fixed seed (`SEED`) to generate a random account ID. This makes the generated numbers predictable and reproducible. An attacker can easily recreate the sequence of generated numbers by using the same seed, allowing them to potentially predict or guess valid account IDs. This can lead to security breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:
- Use a secure random number generator, such as `SecureRandom`, instead of `Random`.
- Do not use a fixed or predictable seed. Instead, use a randomly generated seed or a source of entropy, such as the system clock or a secure random number generator.
- Consider using a more secure method for generating unique identifiers, such as UUIDs or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).

ORIGINAL CODE:
private static final long SEED = 1234567890;public int generateAccountID() {Random random = new Random(SEED);return random.nextInt();}
