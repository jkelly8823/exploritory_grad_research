VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection attacks because it directly uses user-provided input in the `command` and `args` variables without proper sanitization or validation. This can allow attackers to inject malicious commands or arguments, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. The lines of code that are vulnerable are the ones where the `command` variable is used to determine which action to take, as well as the lines where the `args` variable is used to input data to those actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
1. Validate and sanitize user input data before using it in the `command` and `args` variables. This can be done by using a whitelist of allowed commands and arguments, and checking the input against this whitelist.
2. Use a secure method to map the user input to the corresponding actions, such as using a dictionary or a lookup table to map commands to actions.
3. Avoid directly using user input in function calls or system commands, and instead use secure methods such as parameterized queries or prepared statements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def dispatchCommand(command, user, args):
    if command == 'Login': 
        loginUser(args)
        return
    
    # user has requested a file
    if command == 'Retrieve_file':
        if authenticated(user) and ownsFile(user,args):
            sendFile(args)
            return
            
    if command == 'List_files':
        listFiles(args)
        return
        
    ...
```
