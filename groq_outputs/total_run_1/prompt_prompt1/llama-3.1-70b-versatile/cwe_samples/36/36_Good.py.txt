VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The filename passed as a command-line argument is directly used to construct the path to the file without proper validation. This can be exploited by an attacker to read any file on the system, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure. For example, an attacker could pass a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` to read the system's password file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the filename to ensure it is not trying to traverse up the directory hierarchy. You can use the `os.path.basename` function to get the filename without the directory path and then use it to construct the full path. Additionally, you should also use try-except block to catch and handle any potential exceptions that may occur when trying to open the file.

Here's an example of how the vulnerable line can be fixed:
```python
filename = os.path.basename(sys.argv[1])
if not filename or filename.startswith('/'):
    print("Error - invalid filename")
    sys.exit(1)
path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
import os
import sys
def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.normpath(f"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}")
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")

main()
```
