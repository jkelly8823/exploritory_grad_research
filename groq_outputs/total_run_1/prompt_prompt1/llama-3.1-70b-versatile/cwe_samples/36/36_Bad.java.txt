VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The filename is taken from a system property without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate the system property to point to a different file, possibly resulting in sensitive data exposure or even code execution.

The use of `System.getProperty` to retrieve a file path, especially when combined with `File` class usage, increases the risk of path traversal attacks if the retrieved path is not properly validated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate the filename to ensure it does not contain malicious paths. This can be done by:

1. Using a whitelist-based approach to only allow specific, pre-approved files and directories.
2. Removing any malicious or unwanted paths by normalization or canonicalization of the file path.
3. Using a secure library or function to access and validate the file path.

Here's a more secure version of the code:
```java
String filename = System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile");
// Validation and sanitization of filename
String baseDirectory = "/path/to/allowed/directory";
File baseDir = new File(baseDirectory);
File dictionaryFile = new File(baseDir, filename);
if (!dictionaryFile.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(baseDir.getCanonicalPath())) {
    throw new SecurityException("Invalid file path: " + filename);
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String filename = System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile");
File dictionaryFile = new File(filename);
```
