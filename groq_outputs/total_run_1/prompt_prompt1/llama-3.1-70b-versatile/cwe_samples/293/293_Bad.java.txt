VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code is vulnerable to a referer-based authentication bypass vulnerability. The code relies solely on the 'referer' header to determine whether to grant privileged access.

EXPLANATION:
The 'referer' header is easily spoofable by an attacker, as it can be modified in the request sent to the server. This means an attacker can potentially bypass the security check by setting the 'referer' header to the trusted value, even if they do not originate from that domain. Furthermore, the referer header is often considered unreliable, as some browsers may not send it, and some networks may strip it for privacy reasons.

The code uses the equals() method for string comparison, which can throw a NullPointerException if the 'referer' header is missing. However, the major security issue remains the reliance on the referer header.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should use a more secure authentication mechanism that does not rely solely on the referer header. Some potential approaches include:

- User-based authentication with sessions or tokens.
- IP-based access control lists (ACLs) if the incoming IP addresses are known and trustworthy.
- Request signing or encryption.

For the sake of this task, we will assume that we want to stick with a referer-based check as an additional security precaution, but we will add additional checks to ensure its security.

```java
boolean processConnectionRequest(HttpServletRequest request) {
    String referer = request.getHeader("referer");
    String trustedReferer = "http://www.example.com/";
    if (referer != null && referer.startsWith(trustedReferer)) {
        // Additional checks can be performed here to further verify the request.
        // Examples include IP-based ACLs, request signing, or encrypted cookies.
        openPrivilegedConnection(request);
        return true;
    } else {
        sendPrivilegeError(request);
        return false;
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
boolean processConnectionRequest(HttpServletRequest request){
    String referer = request.getHeader("referer")
    String trustedReferer = "http://www.example.com/"
    if(referer.equals(trustedReferer)){
        openPrivilegedConnection(request);
        return true;
    }else{
        sendPrivilegeError(request);
        return false;
    }
}
```
