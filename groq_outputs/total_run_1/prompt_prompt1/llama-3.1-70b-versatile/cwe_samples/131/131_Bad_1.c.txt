VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory leak in dynamic memory allocation using malloc.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, dynamic memory is allocated using malloc to store an array of img_t structures. However, there is no corresponding call to free this memory. If an error occurs or this memory is no longer needed, the allocated memory will not be released, resulting in a memory leak. This can lead to memory exhaustion and potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Additionally, malloc can fail if there is not enough memory available, and it returns NULL in that case. However, the code does not check for this possibility, which can cause a segmentation fault or undefined behavior if the returned pointer is dereferenced.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:
- Use malloc only when necessary and check its return value to prevent null pointer dereferences.
- Free the allocated memory when it is no longer needed using free(table_ptr).
- Consider using smart pointers or a memory-safe alternative to manual memory management with malloc.

ORIGINAL CODE:

img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);

Consider rewriting the code as follows:

img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = malloc(num_imgs * sizeof(img_t)); // Remove unnecessary cast
if (table_ptr == NULL) {
    // Handle memory allocation failure
}
...
// When table_ptr is no longer needed
free(table_ptr);
