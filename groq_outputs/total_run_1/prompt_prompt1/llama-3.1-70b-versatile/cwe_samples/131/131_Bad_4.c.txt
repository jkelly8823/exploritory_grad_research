VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to missing free().

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for an array of three integers using malloc(), but does not free this memory when it is no longer needed. This can cause a resource leak, where memory is allocated but never released, potentially leading to performance issues or even crashes. In this case, the code does check for the successful allocation of memory and exits with a non-zero status if the allocation fails. However, it does not handle the possibility of an exception occurring after the allocation but before the memory is used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a call to free() should be added to release the allocated memory when it is no longer needed. This should be done at the end of the function or when the id_sequence is no longer in use, to prevent a resource leak.

Additionally, it's a good practice to check the return value of malloc() and handle the error condition properly. In this case, the error handling is done but it would be better to use a more informative error message or handle the error in a more robust way.

Improvements to the code could include:

- Error handling: Add proper error handling to ensure the code behaves as expected in case of allocation failure.
- Memory Management: Always free allocated memory to prevent resource leaks.
- Code organization: Consider separating the allocation, initialization, and deallocation of the id_sequence into separate functions for better code organization.

ORIGINAL CODE:
int *id_sequence;
                    
 /* Allocate space for an array of three ids. */
 
 
id_sequence = (int*) malloc(3);if (id_sequence == NULL) exit(1);
 
 /* Populate the id array. */
 
 
id_sequence[0] = 13579;id_sequence[1] = 24680;id_sequence[2] = 97531;
