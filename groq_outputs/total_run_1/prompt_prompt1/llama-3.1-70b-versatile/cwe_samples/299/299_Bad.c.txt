VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an assignment vulnerability in the if statement condition.

EXPLANATION:
The code inside the if statement will always execute because the condition uses a single equals sign (=) which is the assignment operator, rather than a double equals sign (==) which is the equality operator. This means that cert will be assigned the value of SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) and then the if statement will evaluate to true if the assignment was successful, and false if it was not. However, it seems that the intention of the code is to check if cert is not NULL, not to assign a value to it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the if statement to use the equality operator (==) to correctly compare the value of SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) to cert. Here is the corrected code:
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))

Alternatively, you could assign the result of SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl) to cert before the if statement and then check if cert is not NULL:
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL)

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got a certificate, do secret things
}
