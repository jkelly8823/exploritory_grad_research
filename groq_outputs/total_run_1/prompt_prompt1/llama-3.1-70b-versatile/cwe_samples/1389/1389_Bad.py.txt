VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Subprocess Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `run_ping` function uses the `subprocess.call` method to execute the `ping` command with the input IP address. However, the input IP address is not sanitized or quoted properly, which makes it vulnerable to command injection attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data loss, or system compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you can use the following approaches:

1.  Use the `subprocess.call` method's `stdout` and `stderr` arguments to suppress output and prevent command injection attacks.
2.  Use the `shell=False` argument to prevent the `subprocess.call` method from using the shell to execute the command. This is the default behavior in Python 3, but it's good practice to be explicit.
3.  Instead of using the `subprocess.call` method, consider using the `subprocess.run` method, which is a higher-level interface that's safer and more flexible.

Here's an updated version of the `run_ping` function that addresses the vulnerability:

```python
import subprocess

def run_ping(ip: str):
    validated = validate_ip(ip)
    result = subprocess.run(["ping", validated], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    print(result.returncode)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
import subprocess

def validate_ip(ip: str):

    split_ip = ip.split('.')
    if len(split_ip) > 4 or len(split_ip) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid IP length")

    for octet in split_ip:
        try:
            int(octet, 10)
        except ValueError as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Cannot convert IP octet to int - {e}")

    return ip

def run_ping(ip: str):
    validated = validate_ip(ip)
    result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
    print(result)
```
