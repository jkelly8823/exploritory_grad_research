VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) and command injection attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression used in the `validate_ip_regex` function is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. The use of repeated capturing groups and nested quantifiers makes the regular expression vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, which can cause a denial of service. Additionally, the `subprocess.call` function is vulnerable to command injection attacks, as it does not properly sanitize its arguments.

Furthermore, the regular expression used in the `validate_ip_regex` function does not properly validate IP addresses, as it allows for trailing periods and does not account for IPv4 address restrictions. For example, it does not enforce the requirement that the first octet not be zero.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure IP address validation library to validate IP addresses, such as `ipaddress` in Python.
2. Use a safe and efficient regular expression to validate IP addresses. For example, `re.compile(r"^((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d\.){3}(25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d))$")
3. Use the `subprocess.Popen` function instead of `subprocess.call` to execute system commands, and properly sanitize its arguments to prevent command injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
import subprocess
import re

def validate_ip_regex(ip: str):
  
    ip_validator = re.compile(r"((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}")
    if ip_validator.match(ip):
      return ip
    
    else:
      raise ValueError("IP address does not match valid pattern.")

def run_ping_regex(ip: str):
  
  validated = validate_ip_regex(ip)
  result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
  print(result)
```
