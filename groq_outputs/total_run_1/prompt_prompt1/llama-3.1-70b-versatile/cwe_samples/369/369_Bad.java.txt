VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Possible division by zero vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment performs integer division to calculate the average response time. However, it does not check if the divisor (numRequests) is zero before performing the division. This can lead to an ArithmeticException or divide-by-zero error at runtime if numRequests is zero.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add input validation to ensure that numRequests is not zero before performing the division. This can be achieved by throwing a custom exception or returning an error message when numRequests is zero. Additionally, consider using floating-point division (double or float) instead of integer division to handle cases where the average response time is not an integer.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests) {return totalTime / numRequests;}
