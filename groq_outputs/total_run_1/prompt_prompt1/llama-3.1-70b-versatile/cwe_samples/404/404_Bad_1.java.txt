VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak due to unhandled exception.

EXPLANATION:
The given code tries to establish a database connection but does not handle the resource properly. In the event of an exception, the method only logs the error and does not close the connection. This can result in a resource leak because an unclosed connection consumes valuable database resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The best practice is to close the database connection within a finally block, which ensures it gets closed regardless of the result of the method. Alternatively, using Java 7's try-with-resources statement is recommended for resource handling.

```
try (Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string)) {
    // database operations here
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(e);
}
```

However, if using an older version of Java, the finally block can be used:

```
Connection con = null;
try {
    con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);
    // database operations here
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(e);
} finally {
    if (con != null) {
        try {
            con.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            log(ex);
        }
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}catch ( Exception e ) {log( e );}
