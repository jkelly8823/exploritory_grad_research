VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a memory corruption vulnerability due to mismatched memory deallocation.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises from the fact that the memory was allocated using `malloc`, which typically returns a pointer that must be deallocated using `free`. However, the code instead uses `delete` to deallocate the memory. This can lead to undefined behavior, including memory leaks, crashes, or other forms of memory corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the correct deallocation function should be used, which in this case is `free` since `malloc` was used to allocate the memory. Here's the corrected code:

    class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));free(ptr);}

However, if this code is intended to be used in a C++ environment where `new` and `delete` are generally preferred over `malloc` and `free`, the allocation and deallocation functions should be consistent. For example:

    class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = new int;delete ptr;}

Alternatively, using smart pointers or automatic variables can help avoid memory management issues altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  
                  class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));delete ptr;}
