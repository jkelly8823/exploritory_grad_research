VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection and Potential Resource Leak

EXPLANATION:
The given code segment demonstrates potential SQL Injection vulnerability and a potential resource leak. 
The `queryString` is directly assigned to `SqlCommand` object without any validation or sanitization. This can allow malicious users to inject SQL code, leading to unauthorized access or modifications to sensitive data.
Furthermore, proper error handling mechanisms are not in place, leading to potential resource leaks. If any errors occur while executing the SQL command, the connection and SqlDataReader objects might not be properly closed, resulting in resource leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks. This involves defining the SQL query string with placeholders for parameters, then supplying the actual parameter values separately.
2. Implement try-catch-finally blocks to manage potential errors and ensure that connections and SqlDataReader objects are properly closed.
3. Consider using the `using` statement in C# to ensure that connections and SqlDataReader objects are automatically disposed of when they go out of scope.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```csharp
...SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);cmd.Connection = conn;conn.Open();SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();HarvestResults(rdr);conn.Connection.Close();...
```

Example of improved code with parameterized query and proper error handling:

```csharp
using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString))
{
    conn.Open();

    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString, conn))
    {
        // Assuming queryString is modified to accept @ParamName parameters
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ParamName", paramNameValue);

        try
        {
            using (SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
            {
                HarvestResults(rdr);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle exceptions as needed
        }
    }
}
```

In this improved code segment, the `using` statement is used to ensure that connections and SqlDataReader objects are properly closed and disposed of, regardless of whether errors occur. A parameterized query is used to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
