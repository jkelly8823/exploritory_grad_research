VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code is vulnerable to a File Path Traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by providing a specially crafted file name.

EXPLANATION:
The `processFile` method takes a file name as input without properly validating or sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to provide a file name that can traverse the directory structure and access sensitive files, potentially leading to unauthorized data disclosure or code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input file name to ensure it does not contain any path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `..\\`, etc.).
2. Use a white-list approach to only allow access to files within a specific directory or with a specific extension.
3. Use a secure method to read files, such as using a `FileInputStream` with a `File` object instead of a `FileReader` with a file name.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
private void processFile(string fName){ 
    BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName)); 
    String line; 
    while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){ 
        processLine(line); 
    }
}
```

Note: There is also a mistake in the original code. The correct class name in Java is `BufferedReader`, not `BufferReader`.
