VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Side Channel Attack (SCA), specifically timing analysis.

EXPLANATION:
The code calculates `password_ok` by iterating over each password digit. When the entered digit matches the stored password digit, the code executes `password_ok |= 1;`, whereas when it doesn't, it executes `password_ok |= 0;`. However, since `password_ok` is initially 0, the execution paths and their corresponding power consumption profiles are different for correct and incorrect digits. An attacker can use sophisticated techniques such as power analysis or timing analysis to determine the correct password.

An additional concern is that the entire password is checked at once. Instead, each digit of the entered password should be compared separately to the corresponding digit of the stored password to prevent differential power consumption patterns that can be used to gain insight into the authentication process.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure the code, implement the following changes:

1. Handle correct and incorrect comparisons of password digits in a way that the execution flow has the same pattern for both outcomes.

```c
boolean password_correct = true;
for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++) {
    if (GetPasswordByte() != stored_password[i]) {
        password_correct = false;
        break;
    }
}
password_ok = password_correct;
```

2. Compare each entered password digit one by one:

```c
password_ok = true;
for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++) {
    byte entered_digit = GetPasswordByte();
    if (entered_digit != stored_password[i]) {
        password_ok = false;
        break;
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static nonvolatile password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
do

    while (password_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
    password_ok = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++)
    
        if (GetPasswordByte() == stored_password([i])
        
            password_ok |= 1; // Power consumption is different here
        
        else
        
            password_ok |= 0; // than from here
        
    end
    if (password_ok > 0)
    
        password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
        break_to_Ok_to_proceed
    
    password_tries--;
    
    while (true)
    // Password OK
```
