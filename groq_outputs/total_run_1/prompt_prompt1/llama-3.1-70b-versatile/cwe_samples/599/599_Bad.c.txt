VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Assignment vulnerability in conditional statement.

EXPLANATION:
The given segment of code contains a vulnerability due to improper use of the assignment operator in a conditional statement. In the line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))`, a single equals sign is used, which will assign the return value of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the `cert` variable and then check its value. This may not be the intended behavior, especially in a conditional statement where a comparison is expected.

While this code may still work as intended if the `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` function returns a non-zero (or "truthy") value, this assignment behavior can lead to unexpected results if the return value is zero or another "falsy" value. This could potentially introduce a security vulnerability by opening the door to incorrect certificate validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a comparison operator (`==`) instead of an assignment operator (`=`) to check the return value of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` in the conditional statement.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
}
```
However, if the author's intention is to check whether `cert` is assigned a valid certificate, it is better to do the assignment outside the conditional statement and then check for `cert != NULL` or a similar condition.

```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
}
```
