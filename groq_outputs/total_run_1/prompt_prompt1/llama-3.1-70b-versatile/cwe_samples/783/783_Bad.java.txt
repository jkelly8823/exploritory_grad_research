VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The calculated Return on Investment (ROI) may result in an incorrect value due to operator precedence.

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to calculate the ROI by subtracting the initial investment from the current value and then dividing by the initial investment. However, the subtraction operator has higher precedence than the division operator, so the division operation will be performed before the subtraction. This will lead to incorrect results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code should use parentheses to ensure that the subtraction operation is performed before the division. Here is the corrected line:

returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;

Alternatively, the code could also simplify the calculation by using a formula that directly calculates the ROI:

returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;

However, it's worth noting that the code can be further simplified to directly calculate the ROI:

returnROI = (currentValue / initialInvestment) - 1;

This formula is more accurate and follows the conventional formula for calculating ROI.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public double calculateReturnOnInvestment(double currentValue, double initialInvestment) {
    double returnROI = 0.0;
    // calculate return on investment
    returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment;
    return returnROI;
}
```
