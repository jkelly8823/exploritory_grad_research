VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is an Unhandled Exception and Insecure Use of System_EXIT. The application is catching a custom exception (ApplicationSpecificException) but then uses `System.exit(1)` which terminates the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) immediately. 

EXPLANATION:
The main concern with this code is that it terminates the JVM when an ApplicationSpecificException is caught. This is problematic because `System.exit(1)` does not allow for a clean shutdown of the application or its resources, which can lead to memory leaks or data corruption. It can also cause the entire application server to terminate if this code is part of a servlet, impacting other users who are accessing the server. Additionally, calling `System.exit(1)` can interfere with error handling mechanisms that the servlet container may have in place.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
A better approach to handling this exception would be to throw it as a ServletException, allowing the servlet container to handle the error. This would help maintain the expected execution flow of the application. The exception should also be reported, ideally with more context about what went wrong.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {...} 
    catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
```
