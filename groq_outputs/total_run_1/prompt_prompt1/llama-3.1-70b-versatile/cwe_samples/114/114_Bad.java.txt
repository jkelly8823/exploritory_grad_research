VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dynamic Link Library (DLL) Injection Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The given code is vulnerable to DLL injection attacks. By loading a DLL file using `System.loadLibrary()` method, an attacker can manipulate the DLL file and make the program load and execute malicious code. This can happen if the program loads a DLL from an untrusted location or if the DLL file has been tampered with.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

- Load DLLs from trusted locations only.
- Use fully qualified paths to load DLLs to prevent execution of malicious code placed in other locations of the system's DLL search order.
- Validate the DLL file before loading it to ensure it has not been tampered with.
- Use exception handling to handle situations where the DLL loading fails or throws an exception.

ORIGINAL CODE:
System.loadLibrary("library.dll");

Example of secure code:
```java
try {
    System.loadLibrary(System.getProperty("user.home") + System.getProperty("file.separator") + "library.dll");
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

In the secure code example, the DLL is loaded from the user's home directory using a fully qualified path, reducing the risk of loading malicious code. The code also includes exception handling to handle any loading errors.
