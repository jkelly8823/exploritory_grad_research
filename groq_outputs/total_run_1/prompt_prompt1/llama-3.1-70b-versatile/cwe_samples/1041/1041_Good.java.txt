VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a potential vulnerability due to a redundant and potentially time-consuming call to the ComplexMath method. Additionally, the main method attempts to assign a value to the variable 'surface_area' without ensuring it is within the scope of both 'if' clauses.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided is comparing the 'r' variable to different conditions (0.0 and 1.0), and only performing the ComplexMath operation if those conditions are true. However, it does not handle the case where 0.0 < r <= 1.0. Furthermore, the result of ComplexMath is assigned to 'surface_area' twice if 'r' is greater than 1.0. This has no actual effect as the second assignment overwrites the result of the first. It leads to the first operation being redundant. Without ensuring it's within scope for both 'if' clauses, 'surface_area' remains uninitialized when r <= 0.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the vulnerability, the 'main' method can be revised as follows:
- Merge the two 'if' clauses into a single 'if' clause using logical operators.
- Initialize the 'surface_area' variable before entering any conditional blocks.
Here is a revised version of the code:

```java
public class Main {
    private double ComplexMath(double r, double s) {
        //complex math equations
        double pi = Math.PI;
        double surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
        return surface_area;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double s = 10.0;
        double r = 1.0;
        double surface_area = 0.0;
        if(r > 0.0 && r > 1.0) {
           surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
        } else if (r > 0.0) {
           surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
        } else {
            //default setting
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, a simpler way would be to eliminate the second 'if' and the second ComplexMath call because any r > 1.0 is also greater than 0.0:

```java
public class Main {
    private double ComplexMath(double r, double s) {
        //complex math equations
        double pi = Math.PI;
        double surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
        return surface_area;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double s = 10.0;
        double r = 1.0;
        double surface_area = 0.0;
        if(r > 0.0) {
           surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
        } else {
            //default setting
        }
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public class Main {
    private double ComplexMath(double r, double s) {
        //complex math equations
        double pi = Math.PI;
        double surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
        return surface_area;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double s = 10.0;
        double r = 1.0;
        double surface_area;
        if(r > 0.0) {
           surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
        }
        if(r > 1.0) {
           surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);
        }
    }
}
