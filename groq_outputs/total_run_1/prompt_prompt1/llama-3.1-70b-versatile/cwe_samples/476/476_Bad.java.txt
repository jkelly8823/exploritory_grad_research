VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code is vulnerable to Command Injection, as it directly uses user-supplied input to construct a system command.

EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves the "cmd" property and trims it. However, it does not validate or sanitize the input in any way. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious commands by setting the "cmd" system property, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary system commands. This is a severe vulnerability that can be exploited to gain control of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize any user-supplied input before using it to construct a system command. This can be achieved by whitelisting allowed commands and parameters, or by using more secure alternatives such as the `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` class with `redirectInput()` and `redirectOutput()` methods. Avoid using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` or `System.getProperty()` whenever possible.

Additionally, consider using the following best practices:

- Use a secure mechanism for getting the command input, such as console input or a secure configuration file.
- Validate and sanitize the input using a whitelist approach to prevent command injection.
- Use the `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` class instead of `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` for executing system commands.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String cmd = System.getProperty("cmd");
cmd = cmd.trim();
