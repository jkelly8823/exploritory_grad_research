VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Resource leak vulnerability due to improper handling of the response body.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, there is a potential resource leak vulnerability. When an error occurs while making the HTTP request, the `response` object is not checked for `nil` before attempting to close its body. If the `response` object is `nil`, this will result in a panic. However, the main issue is that the code properly checks for `err`, and if there is an error, then the response is not valid, thus this warning still should go ahead and be presented, given response could be valid.
Moreover, it's also worth noting that `defer response.Body.Close()` might not be the most efficient way of handling this, as it will be executed regardless of whether the request was successful or not.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should only attempt to close the response body if the `response` object is not `nil`. It's also a good practice to check for the value of `err` before proceeding with the rest of the function. Here's how you can modify the code:

```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()
    // Rest of the function...
}
```

Or, using Go 1.13+ with the `context` package:

```go
func HandleRequest(ctx context.Context, client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()
    // Rest of the function...
}
```

However, handling potential resource leaks would be enhanced using Go 1.13+ context.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    defer response.Body.Close()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // ... rest of your code ...
}
```
