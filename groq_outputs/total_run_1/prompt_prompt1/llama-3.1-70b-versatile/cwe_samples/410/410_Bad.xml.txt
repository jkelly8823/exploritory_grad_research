VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains an insecure hardcoded database password.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provides a Resource configuration for a MySQL database connection. The database password 'testpass' is hardcoded directly into the code, which poses a security risk. Hardcoding sensitive information such as passwords directly into the code can lead to unauthorized access to the database, especially if the password is not changed frequently. Additionally, if the code is shared or exposed publicly, it can reveal the password to malicious actors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Environment variables or property files can be used to store sensitive information such as database passwords.
2. Consider integrating a secrets management solution, such as Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
3. Instead of directly hardcoding the password, store it in a secure location outside of the code and retrieve it programmatically.

ORIGINAL CODE:
