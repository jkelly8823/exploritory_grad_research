VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Session ID Length

EXPLANATION:
The provided code sets the session ID length to 8 bytes, which can be vulnerable to session fixation and prediction attacks. A session ID length of 8 bytes (64 bits) is considered insecure, as it can be brute-forced or predicted by an attacker. This can lead to unauthorized access to user sessions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we recommend increasing the session ID length to a minimum of 16 bytes (128 bits). This can be done by setting the `idLengthBytes` property to a value of 16 or greater. Here's an updated version of the code:
```xml
<sun-web-app>
    ...<session-config>
        <session-properties><property name="idLengthBytes" value="16"><description>The number of bytes in this web module's session ID.</description></property></session-properties>
    </session-config>...
</sun-web-app>
```
Original session length should also be inspected for it may be shorter then the value set here.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```xml
<sun-web-app>
    ...<session-config>
        <session-properties><property name="idLengthBytes" value="8"><description>The number of bytes in this web module's session ID.</description></property></session-properties>
    </session-config>...
</sun-web-app>
