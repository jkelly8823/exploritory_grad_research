VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential off-by-one buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the use of strncpy with a size equal to the size of the buffer. 

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the strncpy function is used to copy the contents of argv[1] and argv[2] into the Filename and Pattern character arrays. However, the sizeof operator returns the total size of the array including the null terminator. If the string in argv[1] or argv[2] is large enough, this could result in a buffer overflow, causing undefined behavior. This vulnerability is caused by the fact that strncpy does not perform any bounds checking on the source string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a safer alternative such as snprintf or strcpy_s (if available), or limit the number of characters to be copied to (sizeof(Filename) - 1) and then explicitly null-terminate the string. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

strncpy(Filename, argv[1], sizeof(Filename) - 1);
Filename[sizeof(Filename) - 1] = '\0';

Alternatively, you can use snprintf for both cases:

snprintf(Filename, sizeof(Filename), "%s", argv[1]);
snprintf(Pattern, sizeof(Pattern), "%s", argv[2]);

ORIGINAL CODE:
int main(int argc, char **argv){
   char Filename[256];char Pattern[32];

   /* Validate number of parameters and ensure valid content */
   ...

   /* copy filename parameter to variable, may cause off-by-one overflow */
   strncpy(Filename, argv[1], sizeof(Filename));

   /* copy pattern parameter to variable, may cause off-by-one overflow */
   strncpy(Pattern, argv[2], sizeof(Pattern));
   printf("Searching file: %s for the pattern: %s\n", Filename, Pattern);
   Scan_File(Filename, Pattern);
