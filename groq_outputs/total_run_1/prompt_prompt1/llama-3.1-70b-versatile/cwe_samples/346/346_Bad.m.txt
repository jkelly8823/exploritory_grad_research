VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to the use of untrusted data being executed as a query.

EXPLANATION:
The line `[self writeDataToView:[URL query]]` is vulnerable because it takes untrusted input from the URL's query string and executes it as a query on the web view. This can be exploited by an attacker who crafts a malicious URL that contains a script, which will then be executed by the web view. This allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web view, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The method `[self writeDataToView:[URL query]]` appears to be written by the developer and it's being passed user input from the URL query string without proper validation and sanitization. Without more context about the method implementation, it's hard to say exactly how it will execute the data. However, in general, using untrusted data as input to a method that writes data to the web view can have security implications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize any user input before passing it to the method `[self writeDataToView:]`.
2. Do not use untrusted data to execute a query on the web view.
3. Use a whitelist approach for accepted characters.
4. Consider using a different approach that separates data from the functionality of the web view.
5. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to define which sources of content are allowed to be executed.

                  -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
                     NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
                           NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                               
                                       
                                       // Make data available back in webview.
                                       UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
                                }return NO;
                          }return YES;
                  }
