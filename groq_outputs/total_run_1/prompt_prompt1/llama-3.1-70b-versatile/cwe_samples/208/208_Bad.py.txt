VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL injection or similar authorization bypass attacks by potentially exposing comparison details through timing attacks, allowing an attacker to compare the input character-by-character.

EXPLANATION:
The function validate_password is vulnerable to timing attack exploitation. The function immediately returns upon finding a mismatch in the length or characters between the actual and typed passwords. This early exit reveals information about the actual password that an attacker can exploit by measuring the response time. An attacker could use this to iteratively guess the password one character at a time. 

Additionally, using 'len' in a for loop directly is not correct. 'len' returns the length of the string, but the for loop is expecting a sequence (string, list, set etc.). It will throw an error because int object is not iterable. It should be replaced with 'range' function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The function should be modified so that it always takes the same amount of time to process any input, disguising the exact point of failure or mismatch.

The use of 'len' in a for loop should be corrected using 'range' function.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    if len(actual_pw) != len(typed_pw):
        typed_pw = '*' * len(actual_pw)
        
    for i in range(len(actual_pw)):
        if actual_pw[i] != typed_pw[i]:
            typed_pw = '*' * i + '*'
            
    return actual_pw == typed_pw
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    if len(actual_pw) <> len(typed_pw):
        return 0
    for i in len(actual_pw):
        if actual_pw[i] <> typed_pw[i]:
            return 0
            
    return 1
```
