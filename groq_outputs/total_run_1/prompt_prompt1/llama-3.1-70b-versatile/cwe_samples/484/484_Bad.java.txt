VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A fallthrough vulnerability is present in the given switch statement implementation. 

EXPLANATION:
The given code is an example of a poorly implemented switch statement in Java. In Java, switch statements without explicit break statements exhibit fallthrough behavior. This means that once a matching case is found, all subsequent cases are also executed. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and inaccurate results. 

In the given code, calling `printMessage(1)` will print "January March..December" which is clearly not the intended behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to add break statements after each case in the switch statement. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public void printMessage(int month){
    switch (month) {
        case 1: 
            print("January");
            break;
        case 2: 
            print("February");
            break;
        case 3: 
            print("March");
            break;
        case 4: 
            print("April");
            break;
        case 5: 
            print("May");
            break;
        case 6: 
            print("June");
            break;
        case 7: 
            print("July");
            break;
        case 8: 
            print("August");
            break;
        case 9: 
            print("September");
            break;
        case 10: 
            print("October");
            break;
        case 11: 
            print("November");
            break;
        case 12: 
            print("December");
            break;
    }
    println(" is a great month");
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use an enum to represent the months and print the enum's name.

```java
enum Month {
    JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER
}

public void printMessage(int month){
    Month m = Month.values()[month-1];
    print(m.name());
    println(" is a great month");
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public void printMessage(int month){
    switch (month) {
        case 1: print("January");case 2: print("February");case 3: print("March");case 4: print("April");case 5: print("May");case 6: print("June");case 7: print("July");case 8: print("August");case 9: print("September");case 10: print("October");case 11: print("November");case 12: print("December");
    }
    println(" is a great month");
}
```
