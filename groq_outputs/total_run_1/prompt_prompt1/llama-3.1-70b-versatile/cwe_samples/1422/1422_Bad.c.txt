VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access and potential NULL pointer dereference.

EXPLANATION:
The function `call_victim` appears to be vulnerable to out-of-bounds array access. The `array` is accessed with an index that is multiplied by 4096, but the boundaries of the array are not checked. This could lead to a buffer overflow or access to memory outside the bounds of the array. Furthermore, the code assumes that `trusted_ptr` is non-NULL, but if it is NULL, a segmentation fault or null pointer dereference will occur.

Additionally, the line `*arg_copy = untrusted_arg;` does not seem to be checking the type or value of `untrusted_arg` before assigning it to `arg_copy`. This could also lead to buffer overflow or unexpected behavior if `untrusted_arg` is larger than expected or of the wrong type.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the boundaries of the array `array` before accessing it to prevent out-of-bounds array access.
2. Ensure that `trusted_ptr` is non-NULL before dereferencing it.
3. Validate the type and value of `untrusted_arg` before assigning it to `arg_copy`.
4. Consider using safe and bounds-checked array access functions or alternatives to prevent such vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

				  
				  void call_victim(size_t untrusted_arg) {
				  
					*arg_copy = untrusted_arg;
					array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];
				  
				  }

To demonstrate how to implement some of these recommendations here is an example.

				  
	  void call_victim(size_t untrusted_arg) {
		  if(untrusted_arg <= MAX_ARG){
			  *arg_copy = untrusted_arg;
		  } else {
			  *arg_copy = MAX_ARG;
		  }
		  if(trusted_ptr != NULL && trusted_ptr_value <= MAX_INDEX){
			  array[trusted_ptr_value * 4096];
		  } else {
			  
		  }
	  }
