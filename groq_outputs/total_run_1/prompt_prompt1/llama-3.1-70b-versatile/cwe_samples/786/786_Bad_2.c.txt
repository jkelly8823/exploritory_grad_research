VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unbounded string copy due to use of strcpy() which can lead to buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a potential vulnerability as it employs the `strcpy` function to copy data into `destBuf`. This function does not check the destination buffer's bounds, making it possible for the source data to exceed the buffer's capacity, resulting in a buffer overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, and data corruption.

The vulnerability stems from two lines: 
1. Line 3: Initialization of a pointer (`idx`) by subtracting the base address of `destBuf` from the result. This calculation provides an offset within the buffer, and when used in conjunction with the subsequent `strcpy`, can be exploited for a buffer overflow attack.
2. Line 4: Execution of `strcpy`, which assigns data from `srcBuf` to `destBuf` starting at the index `idx`. This line enables the overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace `strcpy` with `strncpy`, specifying the maximum number of characters that can be safely copied into `destBuf`, preventing buffer overflow. Calculate and enforce the capacity of `destBuf` before the copy operation, ensuring sufficient space to prevent overflow. 

An updated version of the code might resemble this:
```c
char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
size_t idx = result - destBuf;
strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, sizeof(destBuf) - idx - 1); // leave one character for null-termination
destBuf[sizeof(destBuf) - 1] = '\0';
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
