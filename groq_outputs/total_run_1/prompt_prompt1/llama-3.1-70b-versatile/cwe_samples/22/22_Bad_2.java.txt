VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Vulnerable directory path traversal (Path Traversal Vulnerability) is present in the code.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the filename is not properly validated. An attacker could send a request with a malicious filename containing path traversal sequences (e.g., "..\..\..\_evil_file.txt") to write files outside the designated directory. The code currently uses the filename as-is and appends it to the(uploadLocation) which is a constant. This could lead to potential overwriting of sensitive files or could lead to elevation of privileges by writing executable files in key locations. 

Moreover,  using "bw.write(line)" to write user-controlled data directly to a file is not a best practice as it does not limit the amount of data being written to the file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Validate filenames**: Always validate filenames from user input using a whitelist approach (e.g., only allowing certain extensions). 
2. **Use filename sanitizer libraries**: Utilize a sanitizing library to parse and modify file paths safely (e.g. "java.io.File.renameTo()").
3. **Ensure proper directory permissions**: Ensure the upload location is owned by the application's user and group, and ensure that write permissions are not granted to unwanted users.
4. **Limit the length of user input data**: Modify the code to discard any filename input beyond a certain number of characters to prevent buffer overflow type attacks.
5. **Proper exception handling**: When any errors are encountered during the upload, log the related data along with complete stack traces.
6. **Proper Security Checks**: Properly validate 'request' object input before calling 'getInputStream' as different requests may have different HTTP methods invoked (making the code fail under different circumstances). 

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
    ...
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        ...
        // verify that content type is multipart form data
        if (contentType != null && contentType.indexOf("multipart/form-data") != -1) {
            ...
            // extract the filename from the Http header
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getInputStream()));
            ...
            pLine = br.readLine();
            String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));...
            // output the file to the local upload directory
            try {
                BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));
                for (String line; (line=br.readLine())!=null; ) {
                    if (line.indexOf(boundary) == -1) {
                        bw.write(line);
                        bw.newLine();
                        bw.flush();
                    }
                } //end of for loop
                bw.close();
            } catch (IOException ex) {...}
            // output successful upload response HTML page
        }// output unsuccessful upload response HTML page
        else{...}
    }...
