VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks and Unrestricted File Uploads.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code allows users to upload files to the server without any proper validation. This can lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker could potentially upload a malicious file to a sensitive location on the server. Furthermore, the lack of file type validation makes it vulnerable to unrestricted file uploads, which could result in the execution of malicious code on the server.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement the following security measures:

- Validate the file type and only allow specific file extensions.
- Use a secure upload directory that is not accessible by the web server or other applications.
- Limit the size of the uploaded files to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Sanitize and normalize file names to prevent path traversal attacks.
- Use a secure upload mechanism, such as a temp directory or a streaming upload, to prevent malicious file execution.
- Implement proper error handling and logging to monitor potential security incidents.
