VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8, 14-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and Potential Arbitrary File Access vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses user-provided input (sys.argv[1]) to construct a file path without proper validation. Although it uses os.path.normpath to normalize the path, it does not prevent a malicious user from providing a manipulated path, allowing for potential directory traversal attacks. Additionally, the try-except block catches the FileNotFoundError exception but does not handle other potential exceptions, such as PermissionError or IsADirectoryError, which could also be caused by a malicious path.

Furthermore, the code assumes that the provided filename is a normal file, not a directory or a special file. If a malicious user provides a directory or special file, the code may attempt to read from it, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, consider the following:

1. Validate user-provided input: Use a whitelist approach to validate the provided filename against a set of allowed file extensions and directories.

2. Handle exceptions properly: Catch and handle all relevant exceptions that may be raised when attempting to open and read a file.

3. Check file type and existence: Use os.path.exists() to check if the file exists, and os.path.isfile() to check if the path is a regular file before attempting to open and read it.

Here's an updated version of the code that addresses these vulnerabilities:

```python
import os
import sys

def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    allowed_extensions = ['.txt', '.log']  # Define allowed file extensions

    if not filename.endswith(tuple(allowed_extensions)):
        print("Error - invalid file type")
        return

    path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)

    if not os.path.exists(path) or not os.path.isfile(path):
        print("Error - file not found or not a regular file")
        return

    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except PermissionError as e:
        print(f"Error - permission denied: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error - unexpected error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
import os
import sys

def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.normpath(f"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}")
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")

main()
```
