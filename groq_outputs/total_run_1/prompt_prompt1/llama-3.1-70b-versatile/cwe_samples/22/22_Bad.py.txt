VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Path Traversal and Uncaught FileNotFoundError Exception
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the filename to access files outside the intended directory. Additionally, the exception handling for the FileNotFoundError does not cover all possible exceptions that may occur when reading a file. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and information disclosure.
The line numbers 9-11 are vulnerable because the os.path.join function does not prevent path traversal attacks when dealing with user-provided input. Although os.path.join provides some level of protection, a well-crafted filename could still allow an attacker to escape the current working directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, consider using a secure way to handle file input, such as using the pathlib module and ensuring that the file exists and is accessible before attempting to read it. Also, ensure that the error handling covers all possible exceptions when reading a file.

Here is a revised version of the code:
```python
import os
import sys
import pathlib

def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = pathlib.Path(os.getcwd(), filename)
    
    if path.exists() and path.is_file():
        try:
            with open(str(path), 'r') as f:
                file_data = f.read()
        except OSError as e:
            print("Error reading file:", e)
    else:
        print("Error - file not found")

main()
```
This revised code checks that the file exists and is a file before attempting to read it, and also covers all possible OS-related exceptions that may occur during file reading.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
import os
import sys
def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")
    main()
```
