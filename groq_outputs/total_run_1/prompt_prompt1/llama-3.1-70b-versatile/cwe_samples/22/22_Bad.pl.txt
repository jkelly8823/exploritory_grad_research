VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack (CVE-2020-25650) due to direct concatenation of user input to a file path.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the way the `$profilePath` is constructed. The `param` function is used to retrieve user input, which is then directly appended to the `$dataPath`. This creates a pathway for potential attacks. An attacker can manipulate the `user` parameter to traverse the directory and access sensitive files outside of the `$dataPath`.

For example, if an attacker passes `../../../etc/passwd` as the `user` parameter, the file path would become `/users/cwe/profiles/../../../etc/passwd`, potentially allowing access to sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is highly recommended to use a library or module that provides secure path manipulation functionality. A possible fix is to use a path canonicalization library to ensure that the resulting path is within the intended directory.

Here is an example of how the code can be modified using the `Path::Tiny` library in Perl:

```perl
use Path::Tiny qw(path);

# ...

my $dataPath = path("/users/cwe/profiles");
my $username = param("user");
my $profilePath = $dataPath->child($username);

if (!$profilePath->is_child_of($dataPath)) {
  ExitError("Invalid profile path: $username");
}

open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");
print "<ul>\n";
while (<$fh>) {
  print "<li>$_</li>\n";
}
print "</ul>\n";
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles";
my $username = param("user");
my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");
print "<ul>\n";
while (<$fh>) {
  print "<li>$_</li>\n";
}
print "</ul>\n";
```
