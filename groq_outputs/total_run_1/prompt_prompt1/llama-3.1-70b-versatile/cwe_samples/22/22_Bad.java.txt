VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a File Path Traversal vulnerability, potentially allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

EXPLANATION:
The "System.getProperty" method is used to retrieve a property from the Java system properties. However, the user can potentially manipulate this property, allowing them to influence the filename. Moreover, the filename is directly used in the "File" constructor without proper validation. This can lead to a file path traversal attack, where an attacker can inject malicious file paths to access files outside the intended directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following steps can be taken:
- Validate the filename before using it. Regular expression can be used to ensure the filename is valid and within a given directory.
- Consider using a safer way to manage files, such as having a mapped directory, or loading files as a classpath resource.
- Implement proper error handling to handle unexpected errors when working with files.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
String filename = System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile");File dictionaryFile = new File(filename);
```
