VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a DNS Rebinding Attack, which allows an attacker to bypass network restrictions and access internal resources.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the use of `InetAddress.getByName()` to resolve the IP address obtained from `req.getRemoteAddr()`. This method performs a DNS lookup, which can be manipulated by an attacker to return a malicious hostname that points to an internal resource. An attacker can then use this hostname to access internal resources that may not be accessible otherwise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid using `InetAddress.getByName()` with user-provided input. Instead, use the IP address directly without performing a DNS lookup. Here's an example of the modified code:

```java
// Avoid DNS lookup with user-provided input
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
    String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
    out.println("hello from " + ip);
}
```

Alternatively, if you need to perform a DNS lookup, ensure that the input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent malicious hostnames. You can use a whitelist of allowed hostnames or implement additional security measures to mitigate this vulnerability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
    String ip = req.getRemoteAddr();
    InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
    ...out.println("hello " + addr.getHostName());
}
```
