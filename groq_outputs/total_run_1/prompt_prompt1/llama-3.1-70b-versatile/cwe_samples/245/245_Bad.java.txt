VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database connection string vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code provided includes a hardcoded database connection string within the `DatabaseConnection` class. This poses a significant security risk as it stores sensitive database connection information in plain text within the source code, making it accessible to unauthorized parties who may gain access to the source code. This can lead to database exploitation, data breaches, or unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Externalize the database connection string: Store the database connection string in a secure, external configuration file (such as environment variables, properties file, or secrets manager) rather than hardcoding it within the source code. 
2. Use secure storage mechanisms: When storing sensitive data, consider using encryption, secure storage solutions (like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager), or secure environment variables.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static final String CONNECT_STRING = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysqldb";
    private Connection conn = null;
    public DatabaseConnection() {}
    public void openDatabaseConnection() {
        try {
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(CONNECT_STRING);
        } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
    }
    // Member functions for retrieving database connection and accessing database...
}
```
