VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure authorization implementation

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the way authorization is implemented for the `printDebugInfo` method. The `isAuthenticated` method is not further checked for the actual role of the user. The method grants access to the system's debug information as long as the user has any role other than `GUEST`. This can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive system information if they have any non-GUEST role.

Additionally, the `case GUEST` is the only explicit case handled in the switch statement. If a new role is added in the future, it will be treated as a default case, which is to print the current debug state. This can lead to unintended access if the new role is not intended to have access to the debug information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the code should be modified to explicitly check for authorized roles before granting access to the debug information. Additionally, a more comprehensive authorization mechanism should be implemented. Here are a few recommendations:

- Modify the switch statement to explicitly handle all possible roles, and default to a "denied" state if an unknown role is encountered.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to check the user's permissions before granting access to the system's debug information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public enum Roles {ADMIN,USER,GUEST}
public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
    if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
        switch(requestingUser.role){
            case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
            default:System.out.println(currentDebugState());break;
        }
    }else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
}
```
