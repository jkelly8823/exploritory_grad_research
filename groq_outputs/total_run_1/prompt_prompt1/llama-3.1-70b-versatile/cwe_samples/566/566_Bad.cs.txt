VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it uses a parameterized query, but the SqlCommand object 'objCommand' is used to execute the query. However, this object is not the same one that was defined in the previous line, 'query'. This suggests that 'objCommand' is defined elsewhere in the code and its query might not be parametrized. If 'objCommand' contains a non-parameterized query that uses input from the user, this could be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Even if 'objCommand' contains a parameterized query, using a previously defined object to execute a query can lead to mistakes like this. In the given code, it seems that the SqlCommand 'query' is created but 'objCommand' is used to execute the query, suggesting confusion between these two variables.

However, in this specific provided code segment we cannot confirm SQL injection in "objCommand" without seeing where 'objCommand' is declared. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid the error in the given code segment ensure that you are using the correct SqlCommand object to execute your query. The correct line should be as follows:
```csharp
SqlDataReader objReader = query.ExecuteReader();
```
In order to analyze for SQL injection vulnerability analyze the 'objCommand' declaration and whether it's parameterized. Make sure 'objCommand's query is also parameterized and doesn't directly accept input from the user without proper validation.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);
conn.Open();
int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text);
SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);
SqlDataReader objReader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();
```
