VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded SSLContext Protocol and cipher version

EXPLANATION:
 The code defines multiple instances of ssl.SSLContext with hardcoded protocols such as ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT, ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER, and ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS. 
This may lead to security vulnerabilities if the protocols used are deprecated or prone to known attacks. 
Additionally, some of the test cases use hardcoded cipher suites that may be insecure. For instance, RC4 and 3DES are considered insecure.

However, there is one insecure usage here. 
With warnings_helper.check_warnings(), we can suppress the warnings. However, when ctx is initialized without any protocol, it defaults to ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS and no warning is given. This is insecure and it is seen in the following test cases.

    with warnings_helper.check_warnings():
        ctx = ssl.SSLContext(protocol)
    ...
    with warnings_helper.check_warnings():
        ctx = ssl.SSLContext()

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 The code should use the latest and secure TLS protocols and cipher suites. Here are the recommendations:

1.  Use the latest version of the TLS protocol. This can be achieved by setting the protocol version explicitly to the latest available version, which is currently TLS 1.3.

    ```python
ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_3)
```

2.  Use secure cipher suites. The recommended cipher suites are AES-256-GCM-SHA384 and AES-128-GCM-SHA256. The following is an example of how to set these cipher suites:

    ```python
ctx.set_ciphers('AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256')
```

3.  Verify the server's identity and hostname in the SSLContext. This can be achieved by setting the verify_mode to CERT_REQUIRED and check_hostname to True.

    ```python
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
ctx.check_hostname = True
```

4.  Remove the ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS initialization and replace it with a secure protocol initialization as mentioned in the previous recommendations.

5.  Ensure to upgrade the security protocols whenever new secure versions are released.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 ```python
    def test_constructor(self):
        for protocol in PROTOCOLS:
            if has_tls_protocol(protocol):
                with warnings_helper.check_warnings():
                    ctx = ssl.SSLContext(protocol)
                self.assertEqual(ctx.protocol, protocol)
        with warnings_helper.check_warnings():
            ctx = ssl.SSLContext()
```
```python
    with warnings_helper.check_warnings():
        ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)
```
```python
    def test_verify_mode_protocol(self):
        with warnings_helper.check_warnings():
            ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)
```
