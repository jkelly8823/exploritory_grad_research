VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. In this case, the href attribute of the anchor tag (`<a>`) is directly using the user-controlled input (`http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html`). If an attacker could manipulate this input, they could inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL. 

When a user clicks on this link, their browser would attempt to load the malicious script from the attacker's site, potentially leading to various attacks like:

- Stealing user cookies and session information
- Redirecting the user to malicious websites
- Hijacking the user's session
- Displaying unwanted content on the page

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize user input:** Before using any user input in HTML attributes, sanitize it to remove potentially harmful characters and scripts. Libraries and functions specific to your programming language can help with this.

2. **Encode URLs:** Encode the URL before displaying it in the `href` attribute. This will prevent the browser from interpreting any special characters as HTML or JavaScript code.

3. **Use a templating engine:** If you are using a templating engine, leverage its built-in security features to properly escape and encode user input.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
               ">
               
               
```
