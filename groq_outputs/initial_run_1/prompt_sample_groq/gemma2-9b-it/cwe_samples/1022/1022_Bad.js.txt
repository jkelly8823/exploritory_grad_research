VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability 

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet opens a new window using `window.open()`, directing it to "http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html".  The issue arises if the URL provided in the `open()` function could be manipulated dynamically, for example, from user input. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which would then be executed in the newly opened window.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. **Sanitize User Input:** Never directly embed user-provided data into URLs without thoroughly sanitizing it.  This means escaping any special characters that could be interpreted as code. Popular libraries and frameworks often provide built-in functions for URL sanitization.

2. **Whitelisting:** Instead of allowing any URL, create a whitelist of permitted URLs. Only allow the application to open windows to domains or paths included in this whitelist.

3. **Contextual URL Handling:**  Carefully consider the context in which you're opening new windows. If possible, avoid opening windows that could potentially execute dangerous code. Use alternative techniques like iframes with enhanced security configurations when displaying content from external sources. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
```
