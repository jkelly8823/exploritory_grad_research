VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Authentication Function

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the way the `AuthenticateUser` function handles the input passwords. Specifically, the `strncmp` function in line 7 uses the length of `inPass` as the length to compare, but it does not check if this length exceeds the length of the `pass` buffer. This allows an attacker to potentially trigger a buffer overflow by providing a longer password.

In addition, the `strncmp` function in line 8 uses `strlen(inPass)` which does not check for null-terminators. This can cause the function to exceed the boundaries of the string and access unauthorized memory locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use `strncmp` with the length of the buffer `pass` instead of `inPass` to prevent buffer overflow.
2. Use `strcmp` or `strncmp` with a fixed length to compare the passwords instead of relying on `strlen(inPass)`.
3. Validate the input passwords for length and content before passing them to the `AuthenticateUser` function.

ORIGINAL CODE:


```c
/* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. */
char *username = "admin";char *pass = "password";
int AuthenticateUser(char *inUser, char *inPass) {if (strncmp(username, inUser, strlen(inUser))) {logEvent("Auth failure of username using strlen of inUser");return(AUTH_FAIL);}if (! strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");return(AUTH_SUCCESS);}else {logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");return(AUTH_FAIL);}}
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
 int authResult;if (argc < 3) {ExitError("Usage: Provide a username and password");}authResult = AuthenticateUser(argv[1], argv[2]);if (authResult == AUTH_SUCCESS) {DoAuthenticatedTask(argv[1]);}else {ExitError("Authentication failed");}}
