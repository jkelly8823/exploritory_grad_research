VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection Potential

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential vulnerability to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The `<a>` tag's `href` attribute is directly using user-supplied input ( ""> " ), which could be malicious. An attacker could inject JavaScript code into this attribute, which would then be executed by the browser when the link is clicked.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Sanitize user input:**  Before using any user-supplied data in HTML attributes, you must sanitize it. This means removing or escaping any potentially harmful characters, such as `<`, `>`, `&`, `"` and `'`. 

Here's a safer example:

```html
<a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
  Safe Link</a>
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                 <a href="http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html" target="_blank">
               ">
