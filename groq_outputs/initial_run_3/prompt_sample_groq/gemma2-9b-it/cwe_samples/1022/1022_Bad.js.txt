VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential

EXPLANATION:

The code uses  `window.open()` to open a new window pointing to  "http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html".  If the attacker-controlled URL includes malicious JavaScript code, it could be executed in the newly opened window, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* **Never directly embed user-supplied data into URLs within `window.open()`.** 
* Instead, use a robust sanitization mechanism to escape any user input before incorporating it into the URL. Libraries or functions specifically designed for URL sanitization can help ensure that dangerous characters are not interpreted as code.
* Consider using URL parameters to pass data to the target URL, and validate and sanitize these parameters on the server-side before processing them.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate XSS risks.



ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
               
```
