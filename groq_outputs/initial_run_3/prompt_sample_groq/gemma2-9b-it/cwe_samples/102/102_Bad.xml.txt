VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate form names

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet shows a formset with two forms, both named "ProjectForm".  In web development, each form within a formset needs a unique name to be properly processed and handled by the application.  Having duplicate form names will likely lead to issues during form submission and data processing.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Change the name of one of the forms to be unique. For example:

```html
<formset>
  <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
</formset>
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
 <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
               
```
