VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate IDs (`name` attribute) in the same scope.

EXPLANATION:
The code contains two `<form>` elements with the same `name` attribute, "ProjectForm", inside the same `<formset>`. This is problematic because the `name` attribute of a form is used to identify it in the DOM. Having multiple forms with the same name can lead to unpredictable behavior and unexpected results when attempting to access or manipulate these forms using JavaScript or other programming languages. It can also cause issues with form validation and submission.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use unique `name` or `id` attributes for each form element. This will ensure that the forms can be properly identified and accessed. Consider replacing the duplicate name with a unique identifier, such as "ProjectForm1" and "ProjectForm2".

ORIGINAL CODE:

<p>
   <form-validation>
   
    <formset>
    
      <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
      <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
    
    </formset>
   
   </form-validation>
        
</p>

RECOMMENDED FIXED CODE:

<p>
  <form-validation>
  
    <formset>
    
      <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
      <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
    
    </formset>
  
  </form-validation>
        
</p>
