VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - The session ID is directly generated and set without proper validation or secure storage.

EXPLANATION:
The code generates a session ID and sets it as a cookie without any validation or secure storage. This can lead to session fixation attacks, where an attacker can fixate a session ID on a user's browser and gain unauthorized access to the user's session. Additionally, if the session ID is not properly validated or stored, it can lead to information disclosure and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a secure random number generator to generate the session ID.
2. Store the session ID securely on the server-side, such as in a database or a secure cache.
3. Validate and verify the session ID on each request to prevent session fixation attacks.
4. Consider using a framework or library that provides secure session management, such as a secure cookie library.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
response.addCookie(c);
