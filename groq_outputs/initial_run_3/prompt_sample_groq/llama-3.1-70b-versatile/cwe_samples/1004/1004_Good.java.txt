Insecure Cookie Configuration: Insufficient Security Flag

EXPLANATION:
The code sets the 'HttpOnly' flag on the session ID cookie, which is a good practice. However, it does not set the 'Secure' flag. The 'Secure' flag is used to specify that the cookie should only be transmitted over a secure protocol, such as HTTPS. Without this flag, the cookie will be transmitted over both secure and insecure connections, which could allow an attacker to intercept the cookie in transit.

In addition, there is no mention of setting the SameSite attribute for the cookie. This attribute is used to prevent CSRF attacks by defining when cookies will be sent with the request. The 'Strict' or 'Lax' value is recommended to protect against cookies being sent with requests from other sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure the session ID cookie, you should set both the 'Secure' and 'HttpOnly' flags, and set the SameSite attribute to 'Strict' or 'Lax'. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```java
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
c.setSecure(true);
c.setSameSite(Cookie.SameSite.Strict);
response.addCookie(c);
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
response.addCookie(c);
```
