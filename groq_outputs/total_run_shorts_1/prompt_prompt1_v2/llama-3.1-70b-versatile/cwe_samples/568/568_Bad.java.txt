VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Overridden finalize() method with code execution, possible finalizer attack vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet shows an overridden finalize() method which calls the discardNative() method. This is vulnerable to finalizer attacks. 
When an object is finalized, it means it is about to be garbage collected, so having code execution here can be problematic because the object is essentially 'resurrected' by finalizers.
However, the finalize() method was deprecated since Java 9 and it was marked as forRemoval=true since Java 11. 
Moreover, the use of the finalize() method is very often discouraged now because it's vulnerable to an attack where the programmer calls super.finalize(). If that method is overridden to execute code when it shouldn't, that can lead to all sorts of problems.
In general, the finalize() method should not be used for anything other than calling super.finalize(), and should only do so when the class actually needs the class' finalizer for cleanup. This appears not to be the case here, although without the rest of the code, it's impossible to know for sure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of overriding finalize(), you could override the close() method or implement the AutoCloseable interface to properly clean-up when you're done. In the snippet you've given, this code is generally discouraged. Unless you think the object cannot be safely collected without it being finalized first, do not call arbitrary code in the finalize() method.

ORIGINAL CODE:
protected void finalize() {discardNative();}
