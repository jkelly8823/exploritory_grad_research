VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-7, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code is vulnerable to potential buffer overflow attacks when copying user-provided input into fixed-size buffers using the strncpy function.

EXPLANATION:
The strncpy function does not guarantee null-termination if the source string length is equal to or greater than the buffer size. When copying user-provided input (argv[1] and argv[2]) into fixed-size buffers (Filename and Pattern), an off-by-one overflow may occur if the input length is exactly equal to the buffer size. This could lead to undefined behavior and potentially a buffer overflow attack if the input data is crafted to exploit it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, ensure that the user-provided input is properly checked and validated before copying it into the buffers. Use safer alternatives to strncpy such as snprintf or strlcpy, which guarantee null-termination and prevent buffer overflows. Here's an example using snprintf:

```c
snprintf(Filename, sizeof(Filename), "%s", argv[1]);
snprintf(Pattern, sizeof(Pattern), "%s", argv[2]);
```

Alternatively, consider using C++ and its safer string handling mechanisms.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main(int argc, char **argv){
   char Filename[256];char Pattern[32];

   /* Validate number of parameters and ensure valid content */
   ...

   /* copy filename parameter to variable, may cause off-by-one overflow */
   strncpy(Filename, argv[1], sizeof(Filename));

   /* copy pattern parameter to variable, may cause off-by-one overflow */
   strncpy(Pattern, argv[2], sizeof(Pattern));
   printf("Searching file: %s for the pattern: %s\n", Filename, Pattern);Scan_File(Filename, Pattern);}
```
