VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and invalid data handling.

EXPLANATION:
The `sscanf` function is used with untrusted_input as the source string. However, the function returns the number of successful assignments, not the total number of characters consumed. If the input string contains more characters than the format string can handle, this can lead to a buffer overflow. Additionally, the error handling only checks for EOF, but if the format string is not matched (e.g., due to a non-integer value), `m` and `n` will remain uninitialized.

In the given code, there is an assumption that `n` and `m` are initialized correctly after the `sscanf` operation. However, this is not guaranteed, as the input data is not validated properly. 

Furthermore, the provided error message in the `die` function reveals that the application expects to handle malicious input, but the way it handles the error is not robust.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, you should:

1. Use a safer alternative to `sscanf`, such as `sscanf_s` or `fgets` with separate parsing using `strtol` or `atoi`.
2. Always check the return value of `sscanf` to ensure the correct number of assignments were made.
3. Initialize `m` and `n` to a known default state (e.g., 0) before the assignment.
4. Check for potential overflows when parsing integers.
5. Handle errors in a way that does not reveal sensitive information to malicious users.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
void parse_data(char *untrusted_input){
    int m, n, error;
    error = sscanf(untrusted_input, "%d:%d", &m, &n);
    if (EOF == error){
        die("Did not specify integer value. Die evil hacker!\n");
    }
    /* proceed assuming n and m are initialized correctly */
}
```
