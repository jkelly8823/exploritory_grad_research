VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in getFromInput() function.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability occurs in the while loop where input is continuously read and appended to the buffer without sufficient bounds checking. The getFromInput() function does not seem to be rate-limited or checked for data integrity, which can lead to a buffer overflow if it writes more data to the buffer than SOMEBIGNUM - bytesRec allows. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit the amount of data read from getFromInput() to prevent buffer overflow. It is recommended to check the return value of getFromInput() to ensure that it does not exceed the available buffer space.

   ```c
bytesRec += getFromInput(buf+bytesRec);
if(bytesRec + getFromInputBytes <= SOMEBIGNUM) {
// data is legitimate, continue processing
} else {
// handle error condition
}
```

2. Initialize the buffer to a null value to prevent data leaks if buffer overflow occurs. 

   ```c
   short int bytesRec = 0;char buf[SOMEBIGNUM] = {0};
```

3. Check if bytesRec exceeds the SOMEBIGNUM before calling getFromInput() to prevent potential overflows.

   ```c
   while(bytesRec < MAXGET) {  
     if (bytesRec >= SOMEBIGNUM) {
      // Handle overflow condition here
     } else {
       bytesRec += getFromInput(buf+bytesRec);
     }
   }
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
short int bytesRec = 0;char buf[SOMEBIGNUM];
while(bytesRec < MAXGET) {bytesRec += getFromInput(buf+bytesRec);}
```
