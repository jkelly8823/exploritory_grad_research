VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerable line is "long quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;". This line of code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack if the combined values of JanSold, FebSold, and MarSold exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a long data type. This can result in the variable quarterSold wrapping around to a negative value, causing unpredictable behavior when passed to the calculateRevenueForQuarter function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent integer overflow, you should check if the sum of the three variables could exceed the maximum value of a long before performing the addition. Here is an example of how you can implement this check:

```java
// Calculate quarterly total
if ((long) JanSold + FebSold + MarSold < 0) {
    throw new ArithmeticException("Integer overflow detected.");
}
long quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;
```

Alternatively, consider using a larger data type, such as a BigInteger, if you are dealing with extremely large numbers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
...float calculateRevenueForQuarter(long quarterSold) {...}
int determineFirstQuarterRevenue() {
    ...
    // Calculate quarterly total
    long quarterSold = JanSold + FebSold + MarSold;
    
    // Calculate the total revenue for the quarter
    quarterRevenue = calculateRevenueForQuarter(quarterSold);
    ...
}
```
