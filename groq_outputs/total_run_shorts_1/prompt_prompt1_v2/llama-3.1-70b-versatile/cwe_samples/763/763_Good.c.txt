VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code has a potential use-after-free vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the memory allocated is freed but the pointer is still used.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in line 6, where the program uses `strlen(str)` in a loop after `free(str)` has been called. This could cause the program to access memory that has already been freed. However, it is worth noting that the actual free call occurs after the string is matched, not before the while loop. It should be also noted that a safe practice should include a null pointer assignment as the best practice. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The code should be modified to check for the character match before freeing the allocated memory. This can be done by not freeing memory until after all possible uses of the data. Alternatively, make sure the function is not vulnerable to null pointer dereferences after a free.

Here is the example fixed code:
```c
int contains_char(char c){
    char *str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
    strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
    int result = FAILURE;    
    int i = 0;
    while( i < strlen(str) ){
        if( str[i] == c ){
            result = SUCCESS;
            break;
        }
        i = i + 1;
    }
    free(str); // Moved after loop
    return result;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  #define SUCCESS (1)#define FAILURE (0)
                     int cointains_char(char c){
                        char *str;int i = 0;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");while( i < strlen(str) ){
                              if( str[i] == c ){
                                    
                                       
                                       /* matched char, free string and return success */
                                       free(str);return SUCCESS;
                                 }
                                 /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
                                 
                                 i = i + 1;
                           }
                           /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
                           
                           free(str);return FAILURE;
                     }
```
