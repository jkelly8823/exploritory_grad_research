VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7, 11, 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential double-free vulnerability and an incorrect null-termination check.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains several issues. Firstly, the while loop condition should check for the null character (`'\0'`) instead of `NULL`. `NULL` is typically used to represent a null pointer, which is an invalid value for a pointer. The null character (`'\0'`) is used to mark the end of a string in C.

Secondly, the code uses `str = str + 1` to increment the pointer, which is a common way to traverse a string in C. However, it is more idiomatic to use `str++` or `++str` for this purpose.

Lastly, the `free(str)` call before returning `SUCCESS` is a potential double-free vulnerability if the same pointer is passed multiple times to the `contains_char` function. However, in this specific code snippet, the pointer is not reused, so this is not a critical issue here but could be a problem elsewhere.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities and issues:

1.  Replace `*str != NULL` with `*str != '\0'`.
2.  Use `str++` instead of `str = str + 1`.
3.  Remove the `free(str)` call before returning `SUCCESS` to prevent potential double-free.
4.  However, to prevent memory leaks in this specific function, consider freeing the memory in all cases. Instead, consider reallocating, copying, or not dynamically allocating the string in the first place if this function's purpose can be achieved without that allocation.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  #define SUCCESS (1)#define FAILURE (0)
                     int contains_char(char c){
                        char *str;str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));strcpy(str, "Search Me!");while( *str != NULL){
                              if( *str == c ){
                                    
                                       
                                       /* matched char, free string and return success */
                                       free(str);return SUCCESS;
                                 }
                                 /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
                                 
                                 str = str + 1;
                           }
                           /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
                           
                           free(str);return FAILURE;
                     }
