VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a dangling pointer or resource leak due to the use of raw pointers and manual memory management.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses a raw pointer (`BarObj *ptr`) that is created with `new` and manually deleted with `delete`. However, in the event of an exception or early return, the memory allocated by `new` may not be properly cleaned up, leading to a resource leak. Additionally, there is a possibility of using the pointer after it has been deleted, resulting in a dangling pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider using smart pointers instead of raw pointers. In modern C++, it's recommended to use `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to automatically manage memory and prevent such issues.

```cpp
#include <memory>

void foo() {
    std::unique_ptr<BarObj> ptr = std::make_unique<BarObj>();
    // do some work with ptr here
    // ...
}
```

By using `std::unique_ptr`, the memory will be automatically cleaned up when `ptr` goes out of scope, eliminating the need for manual memory management and reducing the risk of resource leaks and dangling pointers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
       /* do some work with ptr here */
       
       ...
       delete ptr;
}
```
Note: The `...` in the original code is assumed to be placeholder, and it's not considered during the analysis.
