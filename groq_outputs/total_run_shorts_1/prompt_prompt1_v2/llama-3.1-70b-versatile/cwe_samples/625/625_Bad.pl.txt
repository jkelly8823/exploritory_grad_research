VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability. The `system()` function is used to execute a shell command, and user input (`$phone`) is directly concatenated into the command without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability arises because the regular expression `\d+-\d+` only checks if the input contains digits and hyphens, but does not prevent other characters from being present. An attacker could exploit this by inserting shell metacharacters or malicious commands into the input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Use a more robust validation mechanism to ensure the phone number only contains allowed characters (e.g., `\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}` for US-style phone numbers).
2. Use the `exec()` function or another mechanism that allows for securely passing arguments to the command, instead of concatenating the input into the command string.
3. Consider using a safer alternative to `system()` or `exec()`, such as executing a PHP script that uses a proper API to query phone numbers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$phone = GetPhoneNumber();if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
  # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
  system("lookup-phone $phone");}
else {error("malformed number!");}
