VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Recursion Depth Bomb/Stack Overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `do_something_recursive` function calls itself recursively with the same value of the `flg` parameter (which is never modified) if the `flg` is True. This leads to infinite recursion and eventually causes a stack overflow. Since the `flg` parameter is always True (passed as `flag` variable which is set to 1), the recursive calls will continue indefinitely until the stack size limit is exceeded, resulting in a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the recursive calls to `do_something_recursive` are properly bounded. The value of the `flg` parameter should be modified such that the recursion eventually terminates. A possible fix is to decrement the value of `flg` each time it is passed to the recursive call, or add a base case that checks if the recursion has reached a certain depth and returns without making further recursive calls.

Additionally, consider using a loop instead of recursion to avoid the risk of stack overflow. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
  ... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
  if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes
}

int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
