VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL Injection and/or Remote Code Execution due to the insecure handling of user input.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly assigns user input from `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` to the variables `$user` and `$pass`, without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious input, potentially leading to SQL injection attacks or even remote code execution if the `login_user()` function is not properly secured. It is also worth noting that `login_user()` function is not sanitized in this snippet but the underlying problem lies in insecure handling of user input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, implement the following:

1. Validate and sanitize user input using appropriate functions such as `filter_var()` for sanitizing and `preg_match()` for validating inputs.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when executing SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Implement input whitelisting to only allow specific input formats (e.g., alphanumeric characters).

Example of secure code:

```php
$user = filter_var($_POST['user'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
$pass = filter_var($_POST['pass'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```

For the `login_user()` function, consider using a library like PHP-Auth that implements secure authentication and password hashing.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
