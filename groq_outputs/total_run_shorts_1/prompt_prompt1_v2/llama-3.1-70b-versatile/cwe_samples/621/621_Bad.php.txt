VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly inserts user-provided input into SQL queries. Specifically, the `mysql_real_escape_string` function does not prevent all possible SQL injection attacks, as it only escapes quotes to prevent basic quote-based injection. A determined attacker can craft a payload to bypass this protection and inject malicious SQL.

Furthermore, the `extract` function can lead to arbitrary variable declaration, which in this context could potentially introduce security risks. However, the use of `mysql_query` without error handling is a primary concern.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Avoid using the `extract` function, as it can lead to security issues due to unexpected variable declaration. Instead, validate and sanitize user input explicitly.
3. Ensure proper error handling when executing SQL queries to prevent revealing sensitive information in case of an error.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
//Log user in, and set $isAdmin to true if user is an administrator
function login($user,$pass){$query = buildQuery($user,$pass);mysql_query($query);if(getUserRole($user) == "Admin"){$isAdmin = true;}}
$isAdmin = false;extract($_POST);login(mysql_real_escape_string($user),mysql_real_escape_string($pass));
```
