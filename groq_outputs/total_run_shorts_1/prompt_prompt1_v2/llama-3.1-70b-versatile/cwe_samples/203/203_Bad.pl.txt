VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Username Enumeration Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs when an application reveals to an attacker whether a certain username exists or not. Although the intended functionality is to notify users of valid/invalid usernames and passwords, this can lead to malicious actors being able to enumerate valid usernames.

EXPLANATION:
Our analysis found that the provided code can be exploited by an attacker to obtain a list of valid usernames through a brute-force attack. This can be achieved by providing different usernames in input, thus identifying which usernames result in an "unknown username" error versus an "incorrect password" error.

Additionally, even though we do not see the exact implementations of `IsValidUsername` and `IsValidPassword`, the function calls do not seem to include additional verification parameters (e.g., two-factor codes). Furthermore, it appears that the password verification is directly linked to the username verification. If a malicious actor was to successfully guess a valid username and password combination, the `print "Login Successful";` statement suggests that access to certain protected resources might be granted without extra factors or authorization mechanisms.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Modify the code to always return the same error message, regardless of the validity of the username or password. This would ensure that an attacker cannot determine whether a username or password is incorrect.
   ```lua
    if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1) {
        if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1) {
            print "Login Successful";
        } else {
            print "Login Failed";
        }
    } else {
        print "Login Failed";
    }
   ```
2. Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent attackers from attempting to enumerate valid usernames in a short amount of time. Incorporating IP blocking for IP addresses with multiple login attempts may also be beneficial.
3. Incorporate two-factor authentication and make sure to enforce password complexity requirements to prevent brute-force attacks.
4. Protect sensitive messages from appearing on publicly accessible endpoints. Return internal server error messages instead.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $username=param('username');
my $password=param('password');

if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
{
if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
{
print "Login Successful";
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
}
}
else
{
print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
```
