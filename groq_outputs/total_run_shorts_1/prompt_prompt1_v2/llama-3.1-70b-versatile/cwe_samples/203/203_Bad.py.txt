VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Comparison of Passwords and Comparison of Sensitive Data ( Timing Attack)

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided compares two passwords in a way that is vulnerable to timing attacks. A timing attack occurs when an attacker can deduce information about the target value (in this case, the actual password) by measuring the time it takes for the comparison function to return. The code uses early returns, which means that if the first characters of the passwords do not match, the function immediately returns 0. This early return leaks information about the correct password, as it allows an attacker to narrow down the possible values of the correct password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should compare the passwords in a way that takes constant time, regardless of the values being compared. This can be achieved by using a single return statement and a variable to store the comparison result. Python's standard library also provides a function called `hmac.compare_digest()` that compares two strings in a way that takes constant time, making it more secure for comparing sensitive data like passwords.

```python
import hmac

def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    if len(actual_pw) != len(typed_pw):
        return False
    
    result = True
    for i in range(len(actual_pw)):
        if actual_pw[i] != typed_pw[i]:
            result = False
        
    return result
```

Alternatively, use `hmac.compare_digest()`:

```python
import hmac

def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    return hmac.compare_digest(actual_pw, typed_pw)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def validate_password(actual_pw, typed_pw):
    if len(actual_pw) <> len(typed_pw):
        return 0
    for i in len(actual_pw):
        if actual_pw[i] <> typed_pw[i]:
            return 0
        
    return 1
```
