VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The default branch of the switch statement prints an unknown error message with the actual error value, potentially leaking sensitive information about the system state.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the default branch of the switch statement prints the value of the `result` variable, which might contain sensitive information about the system state or the security check failure reason. This information could be used by an attacker to refine their attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended approach to handle unknown errors is to log the error and present a generic error message to the user. This way, the system state is not disclosed to potential attackers.

To address this issue, you can modify the default branch to log the error with a specific error number and display a generic error message to the user, for example:

```c
default:
    // Log the error with a specific error number
    // Replace 'log_unknown_error' with your actual logging function
    log_unknown_error("Security check failed with unknown result: %d", result);
    // Display a generic error message to the user
    printf("A security check error occurred. Please contact the system administrator.\n");
    exit(-1);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  #define FAILED 0#define PASSED 1int result;...result = security_check(data);switch (result) {
                        case FAILED:printf("Security check failed!\n");exit(-1);
                              //Break never reached because of exit()
                              break;
                           case PASSED:printf("Security check passed.\n");break;
                           default:printf("Unknown error (%d), exiting...\n",result);exit(-1);
                        
                     }
