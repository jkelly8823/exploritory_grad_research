VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Input and Potential Information Disclosure.

EXPLANATION:
The code evaluates the return value of the function process_data(data) but does not validate the input data. This is a vulnerability as an attacker can potentially inject malicious data, causing the function process_data(data) to return unexpected values, which are not properly handled by the code. Furthermore, the print statements in the match cases potentially disclose information about the internal state of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input data before passing it to the function process_data(data).
2. Avoid using print statements to handle errors or unexpected conditions. Instead, use proper logging mechanisms to log the error and handle the situation gracefully.
3. Consider using try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions raised by the function process_data(data).

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  result = process_data(data)
                  match result:
                  case 0:
                     print("Properly handle zero case.")
                  case 1:
                     print("Properly handle one case.")
                  case _:
                     print("Properly handle unexpected condition.")
                  
                  # program execution continues...
