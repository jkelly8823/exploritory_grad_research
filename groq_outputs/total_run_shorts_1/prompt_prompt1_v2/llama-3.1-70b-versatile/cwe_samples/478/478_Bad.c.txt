VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No security vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a simple conditional statement based on the result of a security check. It defines two constants, FAILED and PASSED, and uses a switch statement to handle the result of the security check. The code exits with a non-zero status code if the security check fails, which is a common practice to indicate an error.

The security_check function is not defined in the provided code snippet, but assuming it is implemented properly, it should not introduce any additional vulnerabilities. The code snippet does not exhibit any suspicious behavior, such as buffer overflows, unchecked user input, or potential for data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define FAILED 0
#define PASSED 1
int result;
...
result = security_check(data);
switch (result) {
    case FAILED:
        printf("Security check failed!\n");
        exit(-1);
        //Break never reached because of exit()
        break;
    case PASSED:
        printf("Security check passed.\n");
        break;
}
// program execution continues...
...
