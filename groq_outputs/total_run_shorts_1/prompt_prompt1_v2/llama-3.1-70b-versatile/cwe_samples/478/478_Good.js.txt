VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: This code snippet is not vulnerable to any identified security threats.
EXPLANATION: This code snippet appears to be a simple, client-side JavaScript function that uses a switch statement to determine which alert message to display based on the value of the `step` variable. The variables `input1` and `input2` are assumed to be defined earlier in the code. No vulnerabilities were identified in this snippet, as it does not involve any user-controlled input being directly executed or evaluated by the application, and the values being used are not being deserialized or processed in a way that could lead to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
let step = input1 + input2;
switch(step) {
case 1:
    alert("Process step 1.");
    break;
case 2:
    alert("Process step 2.");
    break;
case 3:
    alert("Process step 3.");
    break;
default:
    alert("Unexpected step encountered.");
}
