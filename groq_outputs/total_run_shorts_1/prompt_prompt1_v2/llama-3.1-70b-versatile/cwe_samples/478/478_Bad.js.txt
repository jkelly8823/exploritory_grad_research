VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a simple switch statement based on the value of the 'step' variable, which is calculated by adding 'input1' and 'input2'. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as injection points, buffer overflows, or use of deprecated functions. It does not directly handle user input in an insecure manner.

The use of 'alert' functions for output is generally not recommended in a production environment due to potential security implications (e.g., sending sensitive information to an untrusted user), but for the purposes of this review, given this appears to be conceptual code meant for illustration, no severe vulnerabilities were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It's always a good idea to include a default case in a switch statement to handle unexpected values. It is also beneficial to consider evaluating the origin and type of 'input1' and 'input2' variables to ensure they are what you expect and cannot be controlled or tampered by an untrusted source.

ORIGINAL CODE:
let step = input1 + input2;
switch(step) {
  case 1:
     alert("Process step 1.");
     break;
  case 2:
     alert("Process step 2.");
     break;
  case 3:
     alert("Process step 3.");
     break;
  
}
