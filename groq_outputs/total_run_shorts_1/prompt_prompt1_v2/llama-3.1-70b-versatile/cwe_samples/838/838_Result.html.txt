VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the use of dynamic content in the 'onload' attribute of the HTML 'img' tag. Here, the image is populated with dynamic content, but the content is being generated using a JavaScript function that accesses the 'document.cookie' attribute directly in the HTML. In this case, the JavaScript function is an alert, which poses little to no threat as it just alerts the cookie information, but in other cases, this could potentially allow for malicious code to be injected and access sensitive data directly on the webpage. An attacker may also use JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities to inject further malicious code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the JavaScript code should be moved to a separate, JavaScript context, and communicate with the HTML using event handlers. In addition, validating and sanitizing user input for DOM-based XSS requires thorough inspection of application code, where all sources of tainted data and how they are manipulated and used to update properties directly in the DOM must be reviewed. Consider passing the parameter through a sanitizing function to ensure it's safe before using it to load the image. 

When possible, prefer using real event handler functions instead of putting event code in HTML as it opens an entire tag to JavaScript manipulation.
Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
// JavaScript
function loadEvent() {
  let img = document.getElementById("myImg");
  img.src = 'pic.jpg'; 
  let taintedData = document.cookie;
  // This is also vulnerable code depending on how the taintedData is used.
  // When necessary use DOM escaping function 
  // NEVER display cookie values. Just remove the alert
}
```
```html
<!-- Load JavaScript -->
<!-- HTML -->
<img id="myImg" alt='altTextHere' />
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
               <img src='pic.jpg' alt='altTextHere' onload='alert(document.cookie)' />
```
