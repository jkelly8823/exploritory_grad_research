VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated user data stored in a cookie, potentially allowing for cookie tampering and manipulation.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet retrieves a parameter 'author' from the request and stores it in a cookie without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the 'author' parameter and store malicious data in the cookie. This can lead to various attacks such as cookie tampering, session fixation, or even cross-site scripting (XSS) if the cookie is used elsewhere in the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the application should validate and sanitize the 'author' parameter before storing it in a cookie. This can be achieved by:

- Implementing input validation to ensure the 'author' parameter conforms to expected formats and character sets.
- Using a secure token or authentication mechanism to verify the authenticity of the user, rather than relying solely on a user-provided parameter.
- Considering the use of secure cookies (HTTPS) to prevent interception and tampering.
- Storing sensitive data on the server-side whenever possible, rather than in client-side cookies.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
String author = request.getParameter(AUTHOR_PARAM);
...Cookie cookie = new Cookie("author", author);
cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```
