VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncontrolled Reflection and Instantiation of classes in Java
EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack due to its use of user input to dynamically load and instantiate classes. The `Class.forName()` and `.newInstance()` methods can load and execute arbitrary classes, which may lead to an attacker running malicious code on the server.

The `getParameter()` function takes user input from the request, which makes the system vulnerable to an untrusted source being passed directly to sensitive methods.

Furthermore, if an attacker is able to manipulate the `ctl` variable to contain something other than a string value ending in "Command", this could lead to unintended behavior and potentially allow the attacker to execute their own commands.

Lastly, casting the randomly instantiated class to a specific class `Worker` using `(Worker) cmdClass.newInstance()`, if the instantiated class is not an instance of `Worker` will cause ClassCastException.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The main issue in this code is that it does not validate the input `ctl`. A better approach would be to define a list of acceptable commands (which implements Worker class so they can be type casted), check if the `ctl` value falls within those values before proceeding. An example might look something like this:

```java
String[] allowedCommands = {"Command1", "Command2"};
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
for(String command : allowedCommands) {
    if(ctl.equals(command + "Command") && Class.forName(ctl + "Command").implements Worker.class) {
        // Safe to load the class and instantiate.
    }
}
```

Note: A null check and the proper exception handling should also be considered, but considering lack of variable declaration we will assume they are handled at different place in the code. 

Note: Above example assumes `Worker` is implemented by all allowedCommands. `Worker.class.isAssignableFrom(Class.forName(ctl + "Command"))` would return true for `Worker.class`, any of its subclasses, and anyone implementing Worker interface.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();ao.doAction(request);
