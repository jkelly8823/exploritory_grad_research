VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Remote Code Injection (also known as Unrestricted Deserialization or Type Confusion) 
EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to Remote Code Injection, which occurs when an attacker is able to inject arbitrary data into the system, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution. The code uses `Class.forName(ctl + "Command")`, which dynamically creates an instance of a class based on a string input from the request. This can be exploited by an attacker by passing a crafted string to execute malicious code.

The vulnerability is further compounded by the fact that the code does not perform any validation or sanitization of the input string `ctl` before using it to create a class instance. This allows an attacker to inject any class name, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure that only authorized classes are loaded. 
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific class names to be loaded.
3. Avoid using `Class.forName()` with dynamic input. Instead, use a hardcoded mapping between class names and class instances.
4. Implement additional security checks and access controls to prevent malicious code from being executed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String ctl = request.getParameter("ctl");
Class cmdClass = Class.forName(ctl + "Command");
Worker ao = (Worker) cmdClass.newInstance();
ao.checkAccessControl(request);
ao.doAction(request);
```
