VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of Dangerous Function 'eval()'
EXPLANATION:
The 'eval()' function in Python can evaluate any string as a Python expression, posing a serious security vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this to inject malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. In this case, the input is taken from an untrusted source, making it more susceptible to attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of 'eval()', use a safer alternative, such as a try-except block with 'split()' and 'float()' or 'int()' to parse the input as a list of numbers. This way, you ensure that only valid numbers are processed and prevent potential code injection.

```
numbers = input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: ")
try:
    numbers = [float(num) for num in numbers.split()]
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.")
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


```html
def main():
    sum = 0
    numbers = eval(input("Enter a space-separated list of numbers: "))
    for num in numbers:
        sum = sum + num
    print(f"Sum of {numbers} = {sum}")
main()
```
