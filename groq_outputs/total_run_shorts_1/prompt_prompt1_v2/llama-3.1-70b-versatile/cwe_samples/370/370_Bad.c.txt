VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Certificate Verification Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided has an insecure certificate verification vulnerability. The code checks the result of the SSL verification with `X509_V_OK` and proceeds with operations based on the result. However, immediately after this check, the code re-assigns the result to the variable `foo` without a conditional statement. This suggests that if the initial verification passes, the subsequent operations may proceed without re-verifying the certificate.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should consistently check the result of `SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)` before proceeding with sensitive operations. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid re-assigning the result of the verification to a variable and then not checking it before executing further operations. The correct approach would be to check the result after each assignment and only proceed with the subsequent operations if the verification is successful.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if (X509_V_OK==foo)
    
    //do stuff
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    //do more stuff without the check.
    
}
```
