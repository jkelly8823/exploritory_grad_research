VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. This vulnerability arises from the direct concatenation of user input into a command string.

EXPLANATION:
The code concatenates user input from the 'request.getParameter("backuptype")' directly into the command string without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the 'backuptype' parameter, potentially leading to remote code execution, data tampering, or privilege escalation. For instance, an attacker could inject a '&' or ';' followed by another command to execute, allowing them to run arbitrary code on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more secure way to execute system commands, such as using the 'java.lang.ProcessBuilder' class with a separate argument list instead of concatenating commands into a single string. Additionally, the input should be validated and sanitized to ensure it only contains expected characters.

Here's an example of how to use 'ProcessBuilder' with separate arguments:

```java
String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");
List<String> command = Arrays.asList("cmd.exe", "/K", "c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat", btype, "&&", "c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat");
ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(command);
processBuilder.start();
```

In this example, the command is split into a list of arguments, and the 'ProcessBuilder' class handles quoting and escaping. Additionally, error handling and validation should be implemented to ensure that the command execution is successful and safe.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");String cmd = new String("cmd.exe /K \"c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat "+btype+"&&c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat\"")
System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
```
