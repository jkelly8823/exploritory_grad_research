VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a Command Injection attack. It allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands by manipulating the `userName` input.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$userName`) into a system command. An attacker can inject malicious commands by providing a specially crafted input, such as an input containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `&&`, `|`, etc.). This can potentially lead to unauthorized access, data tampering, or even complete system compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to properly validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the system command. This can be achieved by using a whitelisting approach, where only expected values are allowed. Additionally, using prepared statements or parameterized commands can help prevent command injection. In PHP, you can use the `escapeshellarg()` function to escape shell arguments.

```php
$userName = $_POST["user"];
$command = 'ls -l /home/' . escapeshellarg($userName);
system($command);
```

Alternatively, consider using PHP's built-in directory functions (e.g., `readdir()`, `scandir()`) instead of executing system commands.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$userName = $_POST["user"];
$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;
system($command);
```
