VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the direct concatenation of user-provided input (`latlonCoords`) into a command string that is then executed using the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.

In this specific case, the command `latlon2utm.exe` is being executed with user-provided input as a parameter. A malicious user could manipulate the `latlonCoords` string to inject additional commands or arguments, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the user-provided input should be sanitized and validated before being used to construct the command string. Additionally, a safer approach would be to use a library or API that provides a more secure way of executing external commands.

Here are some recommended changes:

* Use a library that provides a safe way of executing external commands, such as `ProcessBuilder` in Java.
* Validate and sanitize user-provided input to prevent injection of malicious commands.
* Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific commands and arguments to be executed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public String coordinateTransformLatLonToUTM(String coordinates){
    String utmCoords = null;try {
        String latlonCoords = coordinates;Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();Process exec = rt.exec("cmd.exe /C latlon2utm.exe -" + latlonCoords);
        // process results of coordinate transform
        // ...
    }catch(Exception e) {...}return utmCoords;
}
```
