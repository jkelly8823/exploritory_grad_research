VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the code that uses `System.exec()` with user-controlled input from `System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME")`. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to code injection, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.

By calling `System.exec()`, the code creates a new process and executes the specified command. Since the input for the command comes from `System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME")`, which can be controlled by an attacker, this introduces a significant security risk. For example, an attacker could set the `SCRIPTNAME` property to a malicious command like `rm -rf /` or ` FORMAT C:` .

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Validate and sanitize any user-controlled input before passing it to `System.exec()` or any other function that executes system commands.
2.  Instead of using `System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME")` directly, consider using a more secure approach to retrieve the script name, such as hardcoding it or loading it from a trusted source.
3.  Use a `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime.exec()` with a limited set of allowed commands to prevent arbitrary command execution.
4.  Consider using a library or framework that provides a safer way to execute system commands.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String script = System.getProperty("SCRIPTNAME");if (script != null)System.exec(script);
