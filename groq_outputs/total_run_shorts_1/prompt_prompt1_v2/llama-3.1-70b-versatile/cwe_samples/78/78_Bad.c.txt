VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The given code is vulnerable to a command injection attack through the `system` function, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by manipulating the `argv[1]` input.

EXPLANATION:
The `system` function in the given code is called with a string `cmd` that is constructed by concatenating a fixed string and the first command-line argument `argv[1]`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious system commands by providing them as the first argument to the program. For example, if an attacker provides the string "; rm -rf /" as the first argument, the program will execute the command "/usr/bin/cat ; rm -rf /", which can lead to the deletion of files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a safer way to execute the `cat` command, without directly passing user input to the `system` function. One way to do this is to use the `fork` and `exec` system calls instead of `system`, which allows for more fine-grained control over the executed command and its arguments. Additionally, the code should validate and sanitize the input before using it.

Here is an example of how the code can be modified to fix the vulnerability:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <filename>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("fork");
        return 1;
    }

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        execl("/usr/bin/cat", "cat", argv[1], NULL);
        perror("execl");
        return 1;
    }

    // Parent process
    wait(NULL);
    return 0;
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";strcat(cmd, argv[1]);system(cmd);}
```
