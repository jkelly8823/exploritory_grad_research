VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code is vulnerable to a Command Injection attack.

EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability lies in the way the `$cmd` string is constructed and then executed using the `system()` function. This function executes a command in the system shell. The variable `$fname` is directly concatenated into the command string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious commands by manipulating the value of `$fname`. The `validate_name()` function checks for certain patterns in the filename, but it does not prevent the injection of special characters that can be used to craft malicious commands.

For example, if an attacker were to pass the filename `"; rm -rf /; ls -l "`, the resulting command would be `/bin/ls -l ; rm -rf /; ls -l`, which could potentially delete all files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
One way to fix this vulnerability is to use a more secure way of building and executing the command, such as using a list of arguments instead of a string. This would prevent the injection of malicious commands.

In Perl, you can use the `system()` function with a list of arguments to avoid shell injection. Here is an example of how you can modify the code:

```
my $cmd = "/bin/ls";
my @args = ("-l", $fname);
system($cmd, @args);
```

This way, the filename is passed as a separate argument to the `ls` command, and it is not subject to shell interpretation.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
	sub do_listing {
	
		my($fname) = @_;
		if (! validate_name($fname)) {
		
			print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
			return;
		
		}
		# build command
		my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
		system($cmd);
	
	}
```
