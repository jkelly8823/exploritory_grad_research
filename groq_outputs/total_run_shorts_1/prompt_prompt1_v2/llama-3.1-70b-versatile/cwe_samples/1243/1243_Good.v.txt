VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3, 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code appears to be vulnerable to key disclosure through debugging. This occurs when sensitive information, in this case cryptographic keys, are included or made accessible when a system is in debug mode.
 
EXPLANATION:
In lines 2-3 and 5-6, we can see that when `debug_mode_i` is true, `key_big0`, `key_big1`, and `key_big2` are assigned a value of 192'b0. However, outside of debug mode, these assignments involve concatenating key components. This suggests that `key_big0`, `key_big1`, and `key_big2` are sensitive and are potentially containing or handling secret keys. Disclosing or inadvertently exposing these key components through debugging or other means can significantly weaken the security of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing the following changes:

- Ensure that no sensitive information is made accessible in debug mode. Replace `key_big0`, `key_big1`, and `key_big2` with a random or dummy value in debug mode.
- Consider implementing access control to prevent unauthorized users from accessing debug mode or sensitive components.
- Use secure methods for handling and storing sensitive keys, such as encrypting key components or using hardware security modules.
