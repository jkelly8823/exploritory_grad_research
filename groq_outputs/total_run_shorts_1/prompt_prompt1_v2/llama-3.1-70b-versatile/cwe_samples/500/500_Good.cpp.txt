ORIGINAL CODE:
                  class SomeAppClass {
                        
                           public:static const string appPropertiesConfigFile = "app/properties.config";
                           ...
                     }
               
However, if the hardcoded path were to be used for sensitive operations such as file input/output, it may lead to issues if the application changes or is intended to run in different environments. The file path is hardcoded, making the code less flexible and more prone to maintenance issues if the file location changes.
