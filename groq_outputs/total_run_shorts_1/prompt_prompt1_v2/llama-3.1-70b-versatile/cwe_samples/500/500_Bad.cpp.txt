VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Configuration File Path Hardcoding

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a hardcoded configuration file path ("app/properties.config") that is publicly accessible. This hardcoded path could potentially be exploited by an attacker if they are able to manipulate or replace the configuration file. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using a secure, environment-dependent approach to loading configuration files. 
- Store the configuration file path in a secure environment variable or a separate, secure configuration store.
- Limit access to the configuration file by restricting permission to only trusted users or roles.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent potential tampering with the configuration file.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
class SomeAppClass {
    public: static string appPropertiesConfigFile = "app/properties.config";
    ...
}
```
