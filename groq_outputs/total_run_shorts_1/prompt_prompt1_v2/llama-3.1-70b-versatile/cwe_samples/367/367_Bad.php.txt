VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet introduces a path traversal vulnerability via a symbolic link resolution in the `readFile` function. An attacker can potentially create a symbolic link to a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and trick the `readFile` function into reading and displaying the contents of that file. This could lead to sensitive information exposure or potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to system resources.

However, the primary concern lies in lines 1-2 where the `readFile` function accepts user input ($filename), and there's no validation of the type of file ($user) it receives, creating a significant security vulnerability.

Although line 5 introduces vulnerability, the main vulnerability lies in lines 1 and 2 which contain no validation check for input data $filename. and if not sanitized can introduce Code Injection or provide a way to malicious users to read valuable and restricted information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user input for `$filename`. Implement checks for directory traversal (`../`) or other techniques used to exploit this vulnerability.
2. Implement authentication and authorization checks based on user roles and not just `$user`. This can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.

Additionally, using proper error handling mechanisms, secure file handling functions like `fopen()` and iterating file descriptors instead of relying on an input string can further prevent potential attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();
      
    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
}
```
