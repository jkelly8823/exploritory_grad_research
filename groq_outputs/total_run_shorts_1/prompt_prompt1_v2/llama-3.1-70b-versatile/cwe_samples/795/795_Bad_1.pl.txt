VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack. This is because it accepts untrusted input (`GetUntrustedInput()`) and uses it to construct a file path (`/home/user/` . `$Username`). Although the code attempts to prevent this by checking if the input starts with '../' and removing it, this is insufficient.

The issue here is that an attacker could provide input that is something like '../../etc/passwd', and after the check, the resulting path would be '/home/user/etc/passwd', allowing the attacker to access sensitive files.

Furthermore, the `substr` function only checks for '../' at the beginning of the string. If the input is something like 'foo/../../../etc/passwd', the vulnerability is still present.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize the input more thoroughly. Here are a few recommendations:

* Avoid using user input to construct file paths directly.
* Use a whitelist approach to validate the input. Only allow inputs that match a specific pattern or are in a predefined list.
* Use a secure function to sanitize the input. This could involve removing any path separators or special characters.
* Consider using a library or framework that provides secure file handling functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {
    $Username = substr($Username, 3);
}
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
