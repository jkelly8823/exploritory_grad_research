VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is part of a servlet that handles file uploads. The vulnerability lies in the way the filename is extracted from the HTTP header and used to write the file to a local upload directory. Specifically, the code extracts the filename from the Content-Disposition header using the line `String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));`. However, this approach does not validate the filename and can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the filename to include directory traversal characters (e.g., `../`) to write the file to a location outside the intended upload directory. The vulnerability is also present in the way the filename is used to create the output file (line 11), as it is not properly sanitized.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a validated filename: Instead of using the client-provided filename, generate a unique filename on the server-side to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Validate the filename: If you must use the client-provided filename, validate it against a whitelist of allowed file types and sanitize any directory traversal characters.
3. Use a safe way to write the file: Consider using a library that provides a safe way to write files, such as Java's `java.nio.file` API, which can help prevent path traversal attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
    ...
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        ...
        String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));
        ...
        try {
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));
            ...
        } catch (IOException ex) {...}
        ...
    }
    ...
}
