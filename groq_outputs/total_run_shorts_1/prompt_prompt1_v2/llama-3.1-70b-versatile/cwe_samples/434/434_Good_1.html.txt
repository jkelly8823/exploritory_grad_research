VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (HTML code, but potential security issue in the associated servlet)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and File Inclusion Vulnerabilities may be present in the FileUploadServlet.
EXPLANATION:
Although the provided HTML code appears secure on its own, it interacts with a servlet (FileUploadServlet) that could potentially be vulnerable to XSS and file inclusion attacks. If the servlet does not properly validate and sanitize the uploaded filename, an attacker could potentially upload a malicious file or inject malicious code to be executed by the servlet. Furthermore, if the filename is used in the servlet to include another file (e.g., using Java's File or FileInputStream classes), an attacker might be able to manipulate the filename to include arbitrary files, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
In the associated servlet (FileUploadServlet), ensure proper validation and sanitization of the uploaded filename. This could involve:

1.  Whitelisting allowed file extensions.
2.  Normalizing the uploaded filename to prevent directory traversal attacks.
3.  Avoiding the use of user-provided data to include files within your application.
4.  Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in your HTTP responses to mitigate XSS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<form action="FileUploadServlet" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Choose a file to upload:<input type="file" name="filename"/><br/><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>
```
