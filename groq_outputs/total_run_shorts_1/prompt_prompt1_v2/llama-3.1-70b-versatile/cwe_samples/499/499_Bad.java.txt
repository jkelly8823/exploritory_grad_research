VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability due to missing validation and potential insecure storage of sensitive PII information.

EXPLANATION:
This class, `PatientRecord`, stores sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), specifically the social security number, in a field called `socialSecurityNum`. This field is directly set through the `SetSocialSecurityNumber` method from the constructor parameter `ssn`, without any validation or sanitization. Additionally, the class does not follow the standard JavaBean naming conventions or implement any security best practices for handling PII.

Storing and handling sensitive PII information without proper validation, encryption, and access controls poses a significant security risk. Proper validation, sanitization, and encryption are crucial to protect against IDOR and other attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation and sanitization for any input to the `SetSocialSecurityNumber` method to ensure correctness and prevent any malicious data from being stored.
2. Use secure storage mechanisms, such as encryption, to protect sensitive PII information. Consider using established encryption frameworks like Java's built-in `javax.crypto` package.
3. Ensure all access to this PII information is properly restricted, with secure authentication and authorization controls in place.
4. Rename the fields and setter methods to follow standard JavaBean naming conventions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
class PatientRecord {private String name;private String socialSecurityNum;public Patient(String name,String ssn) {this.SetName(name);this.SetSocialSecurityNumber(ssn);}}
