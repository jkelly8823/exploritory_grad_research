VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability, also known as a Directory Traversal vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists because the code directly uses user input (`$username`) in the `$profilePath` variable without proper sanitization. An attacker could insert malicious directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in the input to escape the original directory and access sensitive files outside of the profile directory.

For example, if an attacker were to input a username like `../../../../etc/passwd`, the code would attempt to read that file, potentially leaking sensitive system information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a whitelist approach to validate the input and prevent directory traversal. Here are some recommended fixes:

* Sanitize the username input using a whitelisting approach. For example, only allow alphanumeric characters and underscore in the username.
* Use a more secure way to construct the file path using a canonization library or a proven framework function.
* Use a chroot or jail to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
* Consider using a templating engine or parameterized queries to separate data from code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $dataPath = "/users/cwe/profiles";
my $username = param("user");
my $profilePath = $dataPath . "/" . $username;
open(my $fh, "<", $profilePath) || ExitError("profile read error: $profilePath");
print "<ul>\n";
while (<$fh>) {
  print "<li>$_</li>\n";
}
print "</ul>\n";
```
