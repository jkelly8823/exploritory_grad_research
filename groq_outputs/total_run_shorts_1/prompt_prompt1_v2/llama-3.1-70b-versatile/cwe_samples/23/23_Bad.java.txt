VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 12-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code is vulnerable to Path Traversal attacks. An attacker can potentially upload a file to any directory in the system by manipulating the filename variable to contain path traversal characters, such as '../'.


EXPLANATION: 
The vulnerability is present in the lines that output the file to the local upload directory. The code constructs the output file path by concatenating the uploadLocation and filename variables. However, the filename is extracted from the HTTP header without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious path traversal characters. This could potentially allow an attacker to write files to any directory in the system, leading to a serious security breach.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Validate and sanitize the filename variable to prevent path traversal attacks. This can be done by removing any directory separators from the filename.
2. Use a safe and path-separated directory structure for uploading files.
3. Avoid using string concatenation to construct file paths. Instead, use a Path class or a library that provides a safe way to construct file paths.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
  ...
  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    response.setContentType("text/html");PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();String contentType = request.getContentType();
    // the starting position of the boundary headerint ind = contentType.indexOf("boundary=");String boundary = contentType.substring(ind+9);
    String pLine = new String();String uploadLocation = new String(UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_STRING); //Constant value
    // verify that content type is multipart form dataif (contentType != null && contentType.indexOf("multipart/form-data") != -1) {
      // extract the filename from the Http headerBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(request.getInputStream()));...pLine = br.readLine();String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));...
      // output the file to the local upload directorytry {
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));for (String line; (line=br.readLine())!=null; ) {if (line.indexOf(boundary) == -1) {bw.write(line);bw.newLine();bw.flush();}} //end of for loopbw.close();
      } catch (IOException ex) {...}// output successful upload response HTML page
    }// output unsuccessful upload response HTML pageelse{...}
