VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack and insecure password submission due to the use of plaintext HTTP protocol or lack of encryption, which may result in an attacker intercepting sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The given HTML code for a login form does not include any protections against CSRF attacks. A CSRF attack occurs when an attacker tricks a user into taking an unintended action on a web application that the user is authenticated to. This could potentially allow an attacker to access and manipulate the user's account without their knowledge.

Additionally, there's no indication that the data being sent (in this case, the username and password) is being encrypted during transmission, which makes it vulnerable to interception by an attacker using techniques such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

The code should ensure that the form is submitting a request to the server using HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data and should include CSRF protection tokens in the form to prevent attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Utilize the HTTPS protocol by changing the form's action to use "https" instead of "http" if it's supported on the server side.
2. Implement CSRF protection tokens using techniques such as generating a random token for each session and including it as a hidden input field in the form.
Example of a form with secure protocols and basic CSRF protection:
```
<FORM ACTION="https://example.com/authenticate_login.cgi" method="post">
    <INPUT TYPE="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="randomly_generated_token">
    <INPUT TYPE=TEXT name=username>
    <INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD name=password>
    <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT>
</FORM>
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                  <FORM ACTION="/authenticate_login.cgi"><INPUT TYPE=TEXT name=username><INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD name=password><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT></FORM>
```
