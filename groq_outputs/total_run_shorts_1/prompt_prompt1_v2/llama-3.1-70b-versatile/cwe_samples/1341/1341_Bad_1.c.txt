VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (multiple potential issues, explained below)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Double free vulnerability and potential memory leak
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet presents two potential issues. The first issue is the double-free scenario that can occur when the variable `abrt` is `0`. This is because the `ptr` is freed in two different places, regardless of whether `abrt` is true or not. Freeing memory twice can lead to undefined behavior.

The second issue, which could be related to the first, is the lack of a null check after the malloc call. If the memory allocation fails, `ptr` will be null. If `abrt` is true, there won't be a double free, but if `abrt` is false, calling `free(ptr)` on the "unsuccessful" allocation will lead to undefined behavior because you cannot free null or an already freed pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a null check after the malloc call. If malloc fails, handle the error instead of continuing execution.
   ```c
   ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
   if (ptr == NULL) {
       // Handle memory allocation failure, such as by exiting with an error status
       return EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
   ```

2. Refactor the code to prevent double-free by adding a check before the second free call. You could set `ptr` to `NULL` after the first free call.
   ```c
   if (abrt) {
       free(ptr);
       ptr = NULL;  // Set to NULL after freeing
   }
   if (ptr != NULL) {
       free(ptr);
   }
   ```

3. A more general recommendation: Replacing manual memory management with smart pointers (such as unique_ptr or shared_ptr) if possible would prevent double-free issues automatically.
4. Avoiding the `abrt` flow and keeping the free outside the condition will simplify your memory management.
ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}
...free(ptr);
