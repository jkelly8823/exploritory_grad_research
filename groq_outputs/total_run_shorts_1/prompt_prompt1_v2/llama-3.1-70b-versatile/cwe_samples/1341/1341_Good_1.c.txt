VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code snippet contains a vulnerability related to the double closing of a file descriptor. This can lead to undefined behavior in some operating systems.

EXPLANATION:
The issue lies in the fact that the code attempts to close the file descriptor 'f' twice. The first call to fclose(f) occurs at line 11, and the second call to fclose(f) occurs at line 14. This is done inside a conditional block that checks the value of 'f_flg', but since 'f_flg' is set to 0 after the first fclose call, this second call to fclose is actually an attempt to close an already closed file descriptor.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should remove the second call to fclose. This call is unnecessary and can lead to undefined behavior. Since the first call to fclose has already closed the file descriptor, the second call is redundant and should be removed.

Here is the corrected code:

```c
char b[2000];
int f_flg = 0;
FILE *f = fopen("dbl_cls.c", "r");
if (f)
{
    f_flg = 1;
    b[0] = 0;
    fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);
    printf("%s\n'", b);
    if (f_flg)
    {
        int r1 = fclose(f);
        f_flg = 0;
        printf("\n-----------------\n1 close done '%d'\n", r1);
    }
    // The second if block is unnecessary and has been removed
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


char b[2000];
int f_flg = 0;
FILE *f = fopen("dbl_cls.c", "r");
if (f)
{
    f_flg = 1;
    b[0] = 0;
    fread(b, 1, sizeof(b) - 1, f);
    printf("%s\n'", b);
    if (f_flg)
    {
        int r1 = fclose(f);
        f_flg = 0;
        printf("\n-----------------\n1 close done '%d'\n", r1);
    }
    if (f_flg)
    {
        int r2 = fclose(f);  // Double close
        f_flg = 0;
        printf("2 close done '%d'\n", r2);
    }
}
