VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a directory traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when user input is used to construct a file path without proper validation, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system and access unauthorized files.

In this case, the variable `$Username` is set to the result of `GetUntrustedInput()`, which suggests that the input is not trusted. The input is then used to construct a file path in the line `my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;`. The line before this attempts to remove any occurrences of '../' from the beginning of the input using `$Username =~ s/^\.\.\///;`. However, this is insufficient to prevent directory traversal attacks, as an attacker could input something like '.../' or use Unicode characters to bypass this check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented. The input should be checked to ensure it only contains a valid username, without any path traversal characters. Additionally, the code should use a whitelist approach to only allow access to specific files or directories.

Example of a safer way to construct the file path:

- Use a library or module that provides secure file path manipulation functions.
- Check the input against a list of allowed usernames before constructing the file path.
- Use a more secure function to read and send the file, such as one that does not allow directory traversal.

ORIGINAL CODE:

my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/^\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
