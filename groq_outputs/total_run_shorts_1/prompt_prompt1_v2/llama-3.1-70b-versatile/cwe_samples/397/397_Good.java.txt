Exception Not Handled Properly

EXPLANATION:
Although this is just a method declaration, it catches our attention because it declares to throw three exceptions: IOException, InvocationTargetException, and SQLException. The problem with this approach is that these exceptions might get lost and not be handled properly by the caller of this method if not caught or re-thrown as a custom exception or wrapped around a related exception. For instance, if the caller ignores or does not re-throw these exceptions properly, the program will crash when any of these exceptions are thrown. Although the calling code (not shown in this snippet) should handle these exceptions properly, this might sometimes happen inadvertently.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are several approaches to handle these exceptions. Here are the most viable ones:

1. Wrap exceptions in custom exceptions that properly convey to the caller, what went wrong. 
2. Either log the exceptions at a log output level which the caller should handle to avoid application crashes, or wrap and re-throw the exception at a layer higher in your application hierarchy. 
3. Validate the inputs that you are sending to external services so you avoid having these exceptions occur.

Here's how a potential revised version of the method declaration could look like, catching these exceptions instead:

```csharp
public void doExchange() {
    try {
        // previous doExchange() body here, now moved into try block
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Properly log the IOException here
       LOGGER.error("IOException in doExchange: ", e.getMessage());
    } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
        // Properly log InvocationTargetException here
        throw new RuntimeException("InvocationTargetException in doExchange() : ", e);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Properly log SQLException here
        LOGGER.error("SQLException in doExchange: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```
But as shown here, without the body of doExchange(), we can't properly move our advice of putting body into try. If caller of doExchange() already knew these potential exceptions then just log, else wrap it in custom exception 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
public void doExchange() throws IOException, InvocationTargetException, SQLException {...}
```
