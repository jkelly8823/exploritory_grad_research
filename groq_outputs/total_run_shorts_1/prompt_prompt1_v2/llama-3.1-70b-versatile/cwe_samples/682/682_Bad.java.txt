VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a division by zero error, which can occur when the `touchdowns` variable is equal to zero. This would result in the program crashing with an `ArithmeticException`.
EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to calculate an average by dividing `yardsGained` by `touchdowns`. However, if the `team` does not have any touchdowns (`touchdowns` equals zero), this calculation would result in an `ArithmeticException` being thrown, effectively crashing the program.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability from occurring, it is recommended to add a simple check before performing the division, ensuring that `touchdowns` is not equal to zero. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:
```
int touchdowns = team.getTouchdowns();
int yardsGained = team.getTotalYardage();

if (touchdowns > 0) {
    System.out.println(team.getName() + " averages " + yardsGained / (double)touchdowns + " yards gained for every touchdown scored");
} else {
    System.out.println(team.getName() + " has no touchdowns yet.");
}
```
Additionally, consider casting the variable being divided to a floating-point number to obtain a more accurate result.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int touchdowns = team.getTouchdowns();
int yardsGained = team.getTotalYardage();
System.out.println(team.getName() + " averages " + yardsGained / touchdowns + "yards gained for every touchdown scored");
```
