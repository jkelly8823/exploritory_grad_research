VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. It allocates memory based on the number of images, but it does not check if the allocation was successful. Additionally, there is no validation for the value of 'num_imgs'.
 
EXPLANATION:
The problem lies in the lines that allocate memory for the 'table_ptr' array. The 'malloc' function allocates memory based on the value of 'num_imgs' which might not be validated. If 'num_imgs' is a large number, it can cause the 'malloc' function to allocate a huge amount of memory, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. Furthermore, the function does not check the return value of 'malloc', which can be 'NULL' in case of failure to allocate memory. In such cases, accessing 'table_ptr' can result in undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always validate user input before using it in memory allocation functions. Make sure 'num_imgs' is within a valid range and not too large.
2. Check the return value of the 'malloc' function to make sure the allocation was successful. If not, take necessary measures, e.g., display an error message, exit the program, or retry the allocation.
3. Consider using 'calloc' instead of 'malloc' if all elements of the array are meant to be initialized to zero.
4. Be prepared for potential memory leaks. Always free the allocated memory when it is not needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
