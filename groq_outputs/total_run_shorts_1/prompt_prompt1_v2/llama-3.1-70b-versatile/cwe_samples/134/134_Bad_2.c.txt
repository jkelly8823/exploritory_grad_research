VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet uses the printf function with a format string that contains positional specifiers ("%1$d"). Although the use of positional specifiers can lead to vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized, this specific code snippet is safe because it does not involve user input or external data. The format string is a string literal and does not contain any format string injection vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
