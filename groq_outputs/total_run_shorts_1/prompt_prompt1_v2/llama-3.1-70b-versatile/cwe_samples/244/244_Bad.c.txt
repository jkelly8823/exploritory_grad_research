VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: All lines containing 'cleartext_buffer'
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Memory Management
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a vulnerability in its memory management. The 'cleartext_buffer' is allocated, reassigned, and then its memory is attempted to be securely erased using the 'scrub_memory' function. However, the 'realloc' function does not guarantee that the original data will be copied to the new location immediately. This could result in sensitive information being temporarily available in memory for an attacker to exploit.

Additionally, when using 'realloc', if the reallocation fails and the original buffer's contents have been compromised, there is no guarantee of confidentiality. The buffer should be securely erased before the reallocation attempt.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use secure allocation functions that support zero-filling and/or padding, such as 'calloc' or platform-specific alternatives.
2. Before attempting reallocation, securely erase the original buffer's contents. If reallocation fails, ensure no sensitive data is left behind.
3. A better approach would be to create a new buffer with the desired size, copy the necessary data (or zero-fill as required), and then securely erase and deallocate the original buffer.

ORIGINAL CODE:
cleartext_buffer = get_secret();
cleartext_buffer = realloc(cleartext_buffer, 1024);
scrub_memory(cleartext_buffer, 1024);
