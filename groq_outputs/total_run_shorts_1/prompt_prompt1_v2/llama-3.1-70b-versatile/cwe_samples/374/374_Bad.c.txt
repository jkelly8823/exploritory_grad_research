VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability by passing sensitive data as arguments to an external function without proper sanitization or input validation.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet has a method named `doStuff()` which is calling another method `doOtherStuff()` from an external class `externalClass`. This function call is passing `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` as arguments which might contain user input data without performing any input validation or sanitization. This can potentially lead to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, which could result in unauthorized access to internal objects.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user inputs: Validate `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` variables before passing them as arguments to `externalClass.doOtherStuff()`. Ensure that they adhere to expected formats and ranges.
2. Implement Input Sanitization: Sanitize the input variables to ensure they don't contain any malicious code or data.
3. Use Whitelisting: Implement whitelisting for allowed input values for `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`.
4. Secure Data Storage: Ensure that sensitive data is stored securely and isn't directly accessible.
5. Code Review: Perform a code review to identify potential security risks and areas where input validation and sanitization can be improved.

ORIGINAL CODE:
private:int foo;complexType bar;String baz;otherClass externalClass;

                     public:void doStuff() {externalClass.doOtherStuff(foo, bar, baz)}
