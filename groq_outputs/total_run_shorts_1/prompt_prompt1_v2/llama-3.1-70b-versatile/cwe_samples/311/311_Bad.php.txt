VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Secure Cookie Flag and a potential Plain Text Password Storage vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code sets a cookie named "userdata" with an array containing the username and password. This is insecure for several reasons. Firstly, the code stores the password in plain text in the cookie, which can be easily accessed and compromised. Secondly, the secure flag is not set on the cookie, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these vulnerabilities, we recommend the following:

1. **Use secure cookie flag**: Always set the HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies that store sensitive data. This will ensure that the cookie is transmitted only over HTTPS and that JavaScript is not able to access its contents.

2. **Hash and store passwords securely**: Store hashed versions of passwords in your database or other storage mechanisms. When storing data in cookies, consider using token-based authentication or sessions, and avoid storing password information.

3. **Consider using a secure storage mechanism**: In general, cookies are not a suitable mechanism for storing sensitive data like passwords.

4. **Use a library**: Consider using a library to handle authentication, this will help you to follow best practices and avoid common vulnerabilities.

5. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that your application always uses HTTPS, this will help to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

6. **Consider using a secure framework or library for authentication**: There are many secure frameworks and libraries available that can help you handle authentication securely.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function persistLogin($username, $password){$data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);setcookie ("userdata", $data);}
