VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: All lines, specifically the 'quantity' and 'total' calculations
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated and unsanitized user input is being used in a potentially sensitive calculation, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) or remote escalation of privilege vulnerability due to uncontrolled user input causing a change in program behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided directly uses the 'quantity' attribute from the 'currentUser' without validating or sanitizing it. This attribute may come from an untrusted source and could have been manipulated by a user with malicious intentions. This poses a risk because a high or extremely high value could cause issues like overflow errors, throw an exception, or cause a denial of service, and it may even be possible to inject a string containing math operations, as its name is "quantity", but it's used as a multiple. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user-provided data. 
- Apply a check on 'quantity' to make sure it is a positive number, define its upper limit and the total's upper limit too.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
...public static final double price = 20.00;
int quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");
double total = price * quantity;
chargeUser(total);...
```
Here's how the recommended code could look like:
```java
...public static final double price = 20.00;
String quantityStr = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");
int quantity = Integer.parseInt(quantityStr);
if (quantity < 0) {
    // Quantity cannot be negative. Maybe use an exception or warning here.
    quantity = 0;
}
if (quantity > 1000) { // Define your max acceptable quantity limit
    quantity = 1000; // Use maximum acceptable quantity.
}
double total = price * quantity;
if (total > 100000) { // Define your max total value limit
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to process transaction due to excessive total value.");
}
chargeUser(total);...
```
