VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to integer overflow due to the usage of a non-integer literal in a ternary operator.

EXPLANATION:
The syntax `address == 32'hF00` suggests that `address` is being compared to a 32-bit hexadecimal literal. However, the comparison result is being used in a ternary operator that assigns either 1 or 0 to `addr_auth`. This may seem to be a non-issue given the assignee type and immediate values, but there is risk when working with smaller values and larger data types in the ternary conditional and assigned variable result, and comparison values such as bits and integers.

More alarmingly there are several issues to do with hardware instruction sets and hardcoding. It might cause long term hardware mismatch errors with out refactors or rewrites by using magic values or bitwise lengths that don't support other platforms.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we recommend using explicit comparisons and considerations for portability across multiple platforms and hardware. The actual fix depends on the intended use, but a possible example would include commenting the values with their intended length and use. We also recommend specifying the purpose of literal values using named constants to increase code readability.

Examples:

```
localparamlogic [31:0] ADDRESS_F00 = 32'hF00; 
assign addr_auth = (address == ADDRESS_F00) ? 1: 0;
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00) ? 1: 0;
```
