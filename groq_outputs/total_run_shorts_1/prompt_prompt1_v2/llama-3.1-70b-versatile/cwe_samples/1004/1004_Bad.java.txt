VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Use of Cookies

EXPLANATION:
This code creates a new session ID and sets it as a cookie in the response. However, it does not specify the Secure and HttpOnly flags for the cookie, which makes it vulnerable to session ID hijacking and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Insecure cookies can be accessed by malicious scripts running on the client-side, allowing attackers to steal or manipulate the session ID. The Secure flag should be set to ensure that the cookie is transmitted over a secure protocol (HTTPS), and the HttpOnly flag should be set to prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, set the Secure and HttpOnly flags when creating the cookie. Here is an updated version of the code:

```java
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
c.setSecure(true);
c.setHttpOnly(true);
response.addCookie(c);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String sessionID = generateSessionId();
Cookie c = new Cookie("session_id", sessionID);
response.addCookie(c);
```
