VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded database credentials

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes database credentials, namely the database name ($dbName) and password ($dbPassword), hardcoded into the PHP script. This can be a severe security vulnerability as hardcoded credentials can be exposed in the event of a code leak or unauthorized access to the source code. An attacker with access to the database credentials can use them to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modifications, or even deletion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive credentials securely, such as:
1. Environment variables: Store database credentials as environment variables outside of the codebase. This way, they can be easily rotated and are not exposed in the event of a code leak.
2. Secure configuration files: Use a secure configuration file to store database credentials, ensuring it is not version-controlled and is properly protected with access controls.
3. Secret management tools: Utilize secret management tools like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve database credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
