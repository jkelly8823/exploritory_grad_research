VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Incorrect use of sensitive data logging
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet logs sensitive information (username and CCN, which is assumed to be a credit card number) to the logger.info level. Logging sensitive data can potentially expose it to unauthorized parties and can lead to data breaches. Credit card numbers are regulated by PCI DSS and should be handled securely.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Remove the logging of sensitive information and consider logging the type of event instead. For example, if this is a payment processing event, log "Payment processed successfully for username [user_id]" without exposing the actual credit card number. Alternatively, use a redacted or masked version of the credit card number in the log output.

ORIGINAL CODE:
logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);
