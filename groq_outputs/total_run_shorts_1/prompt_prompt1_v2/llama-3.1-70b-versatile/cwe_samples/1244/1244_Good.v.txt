VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a potential privilege escalation vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks the current privilege level and sets the `debug_mode_d` variable based on the `ebrakm` or `ebraku` fields of `dcsr_q` depending on the privilege level. However, the privilege level is modified based on the `debug_mode_q` and `umode_i` variables in the line `assign priv_lvl_o = (debug_mode_q && umode_i) ? riscv::PRIV_LVL_M : priv_lvl_q;`. This can potentially allow a lower-privilege user to escalate their privilege level by setting `debug_mode_q` and `umode_i` accordingly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the privilege level should be checked before modifying it. Additionally, the `debug_mode_q` and `umode_i` variables should not be used to modify the privilege level. Instead, the privilege level should be based solely on the current execution mode. A possible fix is to modify the line `assign priv_lvl_o = (debug_mode_q && umode_i) ? riscv::PRIV_LVL_M : priv_lvl_q;` to `assign priv_lvl_o = priv_lvl_q;` to prevent privilege escalation. Additionally, the code should be modified to ensure that the `debug_mode_q` and `umode_i` variables do not affect the privilege level.
