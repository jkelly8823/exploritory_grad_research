VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Unauthorized Data Access. The provided lines of code grant all users and all authenticated users the right to access and modify the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

EXPLANATION:
The commands `gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME` and `gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME` modify the access control list of a GCS bucket. Specifically, they grant all users and all authenticated users the right to access the bucket with default permissions, respectively. This means anyone can access and potentially modify the data within the bucket without needing to authenticate. This is a critical vulnerability as it can lead to data breaches and loss of sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, grant access to specific users and/or groups using the `gsutil iam ch` command with the `add` flag instead of the `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` flags. Use roles with least privilege access principle to ensure that users only have the necessary permissions.

Example of a secure version:
```python
gsutil iam ch -u user:username gs://BUCKET_NAME
gsutil iam ch -g group:groupname@domain.com gs://BUCKET_NAME
gsutil iam ch -m serviceAccount:serviceaccount@projid.iam.gserviceaccount.com gs://BUCKET_NAME
```
Additionally, using Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies is recommended instead of using ACLs for GCS. However, for this specific issue, the necessary changes to securely grant access were detailed above.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
	gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
	gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
```
