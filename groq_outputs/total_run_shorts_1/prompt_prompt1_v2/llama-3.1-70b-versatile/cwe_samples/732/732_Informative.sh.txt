VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection.
 
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable because it directly inserts the string "BUCKET_NAME" into the command string. However, in most cases, BUCKET_NAME would be replaced with an actual bucket name, which is likely user-supplied. An attacker could supply a malicious bucket name, potentially allowing them to inject arbitrary commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should properly escape or validate the BUCKET_NAME variable. The.gsutil CLI command handles escaping internally if you don't wrap the bucket name with quotes. If you have to inject variables directly into the commands, make sure they are properly sanitized. Here is a way you can secure it:
gsutil iam get gs://$BUCKET_NAME  (No quotes around BUCKET_NAME ensuring it gets properly escaped)

Another option would be to use the API to access the Cloud Storage bucket, which can help avoid shell command injection altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:


          gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME


  Note: As we are reviewing a code snippet and the actual variable value isn't present in the code, in this case we assume it would be an external value or variable.
The actual variable injection could look like this:
BUCKET_NAME='test-bucket'; gsutil iam get gs://$BUCKET_NAME
