VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6, 9-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet defines two role bindings for a Google Cloud Storage bucket. One role binding grants the `roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner` role to the project editor and owner with the ID `PROJECT-ID`, while another role binding grants the `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader` role to `allUsers` and the project viewer with the ID `PROJECT-ID`. However, the second role binding grants the `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader` role to `allUsers`, which means anyone with an internet connection can read the data in the bucket.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability is significant because granting `allUsers` the `roles/storage.legacyBucketReader` role allows unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the bucket. This can lead to data breaches and compliance issues, especially if sensitive or confidential information is stored in the bucket. The correct use of access control lists (ACLs) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles is essential for securing data in cloud storage.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Limit access to only trusted individuals or services by replacing `"allUsers"` with the specific identities or groups that need to access the bucket.
2. Use a more restrictive role, such as `roles/storage.objectViewer`, which grants read-only access to objects, but not to the entire bucket.
3. Consider using signed URLs or Cloud Storage Policy Documents to further restrict access to specific objects within the bucket.
