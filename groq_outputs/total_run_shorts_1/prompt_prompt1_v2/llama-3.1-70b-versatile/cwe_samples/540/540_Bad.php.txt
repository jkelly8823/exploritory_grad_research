VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded sensitive information
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet demonstrates a security vulnerability where sensitive database credentials ($dbName and $dbPassword) are being hardcoded directly into the code. Hardcoding credentials like this can lead to a significant security risk if an unauthorized entity gains access to the code. It makes it easier for an attacker to access the database and potentially gain access to critical systems or data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of hardcoding the database credentials, consider using environment variables or secure storage solutions for storing sensitive information. This approach helps separate sensitive information from the application code and reduces the risk of exposure. For example, you could load database credentials from a `.env` file, an environment variable, or a secure key management service.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
```
