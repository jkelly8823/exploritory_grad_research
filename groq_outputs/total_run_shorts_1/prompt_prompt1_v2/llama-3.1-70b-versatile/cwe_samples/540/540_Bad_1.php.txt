VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection and potential credential exposure.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not appear to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input for the `$username` and `$password` variables. This is a significant concern because it potentially allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, extract sensitive data, or exploit database vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, it appears that the `connectToDB` and `authenticateUser` functions are using plaintext or hardcoded credentials. Hardcoding or storing sensitive credentials directly within code is insecure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the following recommendations are provided:
1. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to further mitigate SQL injection risks.
3. Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or a secrets management system.
4. Use secure password storage mechanisms, such as hashing and salting, to protect user passwords.
5. Implement additional security measures, such as rate limiting and IP blocking, to prevent brute-force attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

               <?php
                include('database.inc'); 
                $db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword); 
                $db.authenticateUser($username, $password);
                ?>
