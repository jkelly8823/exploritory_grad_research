VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents hardcoded credentials for LDAP authentication. Storing sensitive information such as usernames and passwords directly in the code can be a critical security vulnerability. This is because an attacker who gains access to the codebase can easily obtain the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive information in a secure environment, such as environment variables or a secrets management system. This allows for better control and protection of sensitive information. Additionally, consider using more secure authentication methods, such as Kerberos or OAuth, which eliminate the need for hardcoded credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
webapp.ldap.username=secretUsername
