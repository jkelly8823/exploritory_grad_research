VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Command Processing and Unvalidated Redirects

EXPLANATION:
The `dispatchCommand` function processes user input commands without proper validation or sanitization. The function calls different actions based on the `command` parameter, which is directly taken from user input. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the `command` parameter to execute unauthorized actions.

Additionally, the `authenticated(user)` and `ownsFile(user,args)` checks are insufficient to prevent attacks, as an attacker may be able to bypass these checks by manipulating the user and file information.

Furthermore, the `args` parameter is directly passed to the `sendFile` function, which can lead to potential issues with file path traversal or unauthorized file access if the `args` parameter is not properly validated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the following recommendations are made:

1. Implement proper validation and sanitization of the `command` parameter to prevent manipulation by attackers.
2. Use a whitelisting approach to only allow specific, pre-defined commands to be executed by the `dispatchCommand` function.
3. Ensure that the `authenticated(user)` and `ownsFile(user,args)` checks are implemented securely and are sufficient to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Validate and sanitize the `args` parameter before passing it to the `sendFile` function to prevent file path traversal or unauthorized file access.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```python
def dispatchCommand(command, user, args):
    if command == 'Login':loginUser(args)return
    
    # user has requested a file
    if command == 'Retrieve_file':
    
        if authenticated(user) and ownsFile(user,args):
        
        sendFile(args)return
        
    if command == 'List_files':listFiles(args)return
    
    ...
```
