VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5 (Assuming the given code is on lines 1-5)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use After Free Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code has a 'free(ptr)' statement within the if(err) block, which de-allocates the memory block pointed to by 'ptr'. However, if the error condition 'err' is false, the 'ptr' is not freed before reaching the 'logError' function call. This indicates that the 'ptr' is being used even after its memory block has been released in the error case, which can cause the program to access the already freed memory location.

When the error condition 'err' is true, the 'ptr' is correctly freed before the logError function is called. However, in both cases, the memory pointed by 'ptr' needs to be either freed or used, not both. Therefore, when the 'err' is true and 'abrt' is set, and eventually when logError is called with 'ptr', we can have memory leaks (due to double frees in this context) or "use after free" behavior, which could potentially be exploited by attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To fix the vulnerability, the code should ensure that 'ptr' is not used after being freed. 
- Before calling logError function with the 'ptr', ensure that the 'ptr' is still valid.
- If the 'ptr' should be logged in the error, consider logging its value before freeing it. If you don't need to log its value, consider freeing 'ptr' after logError function if it isn't used again, to avoid potential memory leaks in context where ptr may not be freed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);if (err) {abrt = 1;free(ptr);}...if (abrt) {logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);}
