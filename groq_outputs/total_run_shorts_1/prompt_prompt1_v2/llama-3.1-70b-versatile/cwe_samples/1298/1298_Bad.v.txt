VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Synchronous logic glitch vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, a 2x1 multiplexor is implemented using logic gates. The bug in this design creates a logic glitch in the output signal z. A logic glitch occurs when the output of a combinational logic circuit changes inadvertently due to a temporary mismatch in the arrival times of the input signals. This glitch can occur in the signal z due to the asynchronous nature of the NOT gate used to calculate not_sel and its interaction with the AND gate calculating and_out1. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this vulnerability, we can modify the code to remove the asynchronous logic. The corrected line of code should be:

```verilog
assign z = (not_sel & in0) | (sel & in1);
```

By doing this, we can create a glitch-free design where the signals not_sel and and_out1 are evaluated synchronously.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
// 2x1 Multiplexor using logic-gates

module glitchEx(
    input wire in0, in1, sel,
    output wire z
);

wire not_sel;
wire and_out1, and_out2;

assign not_sel = ~sel;
assign and_out1 = not_sel & in0;
assign and_out2 = sel & in1;

// Buggy line of code:
assign z = and_out1 | and_out2; // glitch in signal z

endmodule
```
