VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The variables {ResourceGroupName} and {StorageAccountName} are directly inserted into the az command without any sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or destruction of data.

The az command is susceptible to shell injection attacks, as it appears to be executed in a shell environment. An attacker could manipulate the values of {ResourceGroupName} and {StorageAccountName} to inject additional commands or arguments, potentially leading to a compromise of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to sanitize and validate the input variables {ResourceGroupName} and {StorageAccountName} before injecting them into the az command. Additionally, consider using a safer alternative to az, or use the az command's built-in features to prevent command injection attacks.

One possible solution is to use the --query parameter of az, which allows for filtering the output without executing arbitrary commands. Alternatively, use a whitelist of allowed characters for the input variables and strip any unwanted characters before passing them to the az command.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage account show -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName}
