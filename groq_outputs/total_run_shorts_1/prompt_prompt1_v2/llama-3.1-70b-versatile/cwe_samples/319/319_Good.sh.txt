VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code snippet uses the `az storage account update` command to update an Azure Storage account. However, it lacks authentication parameters, potentially exposing the storage account to unauthorized access.

EXPLANATION:
While the code does enable HTTPS-only access for the storage account, which is a security best practice, it does not include any authentication parameters, such as a password or authentication token. This raises concerns about the security of the update process, as unauthorized access to the storage account could potentially occur.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should include authentication parameters in the `az storage account update` command. One way to do this is by using the `--auth-mode` option to specify the authentication mode, such as `login` or `SPN` (service principal name), depending on your Azure authentication setup. Additionally, consider using a secure way to store and retrieve your authentication credentials, such as using environment variables or a secrets manager.

ORIGINAL CODE:


az storage account update -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName} --https-only true
