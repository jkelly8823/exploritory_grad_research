VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Data Storage Configuration
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a JSON object that represents an Azure Storage Account configuration. The `enableHttpsTrafficOnly` property is set to `false`, which means the storage account is configured to allow both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This configuration presents a vulnerability as HTTP connections are insecure and data may be intercepted or tampered with.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the `enableHttpsTrafficOnly` property to `true` to ensure all communication to the storage account is encrypted using HTTPS. This change will help protect against data breaches and eavesdropping attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
{
  "name": "{StorageAccountName}",
  "enableHttpsTrafficOnly": false,
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
}
