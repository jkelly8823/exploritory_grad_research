VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet demonstrates proper synchronization using a pthread mutex, locking the mutex before accessing a shared resource and unlocking it afterwards. This prevents concurrent access to the shared resource and reduces the risk of data corruption or other synchronization-related issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
void f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);

    /* access shared resource */

    pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
