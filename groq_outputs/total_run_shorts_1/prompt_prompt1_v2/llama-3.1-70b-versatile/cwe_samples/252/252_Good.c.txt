VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Inconsistent lock and unlock calls, leading to potential mutex corruption.

EXPLANATION: 
The given code locks and unlocks a mutex using `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` respectively. However, the `pthread_mutex_unlock` call directly returns the result of the function, while the `pthread_mutex_lock` call stores the result in the `result` variable and returns if it's not zero. This can lead to issues if the `pthread_mutex_unlock` call fails and the function returns an incorrect result.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, the result of `pthread_mutex_unlock` should also be checked and handled properly. Here's a revised version of the function:

```c
int f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    int result;
    result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);
    if (0 != result) return result;

    /* access shared resource */

    result = pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
    return result;
}
```

This revised version ensures that both lock and unlock calls are handled consistently, reducing the risk of mutex corruption.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int f(pthread_mutex_t *mutex) {
    int result;
    result = pthread_mutex_lock(mutex);if (0 != result)return result;

    /* access shared resource */


    return pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);
}
```
