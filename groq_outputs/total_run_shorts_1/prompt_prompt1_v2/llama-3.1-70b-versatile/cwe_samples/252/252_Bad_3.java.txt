VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Platform Detection
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is attempting to clear the 'os.name' property and then immediately get its value. It appears that the intention is to retrieve the operating system name, but instead of using a more reliable method, it relies on clearing and getting the property. Furthermore, it contains a hardcoded check for 'Windows 95' and prints a 'Not supported' message. However, clearing 'os.name' property will likely result in a null value when getting its value, causing potential NullPointerExceptions. The code appears to be incorrectly handling operating system detection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Do not clear the 'os.name' property. Instead, retrieve its value directly using 'System.getProperty("os.name")'.
- Avoid hardcoding specific platform names. Instead, use a more robust method for determining the operating system, such as checking the 'os.name' property for specific keywords like 'Windows' or 'Unix' using regular expressions or the .startsWith method.
- Handle the case where 'os.name' is null to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  System.clearProperty("os.name");...String os = System.getProperty("os.name");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase("Windows 95")) System.out.println("Not supported");
