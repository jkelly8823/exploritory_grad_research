VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is allocating memory with malloc() but using an incorrect size, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
When malloc() is used with the sizeof() operator, it should be passed the type of the variable being allocated, not the variable itself. In this case, sizeof(foo) returns the size of a pointer to a double, not the size of the data being allocated. This will result in insufficient memory being allocated, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when the allocated memory is used.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the correct type should be used with sizeof(). The correct allocation statement should be:

foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double));

Alternatively, you can also use the variable to get the size in a more concise way:

foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));

Also, it is always a good practice to check the return value of malloc() to handle the case where the allocation fails.

ORIGINAL CODE:
double *foo;...foo = (double *)malloc(sizeof(foo));
