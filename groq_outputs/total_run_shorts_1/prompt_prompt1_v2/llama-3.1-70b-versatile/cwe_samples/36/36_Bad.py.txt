VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet contains a Path Traversal vulnerability. The file path is constructed using user-provided input (`sys.argv[1]`), which could allow an attacker to access unauthorized files.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the filename is taken directly from the command-line argument (`sys.argv[1]`) and then joined with the current working directory using `os.path.join()`. This may seem safe, as `os.path.join()` is supposed to handle path separator injections correctly. However, this is not enough to prevent all path traversal attacks. If the user provides a filename with a dot-dot (`..`) sequence, the resulting path could potentially point to a location outside of the current working directory. This could lead to unauthorized file access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should perform additional validation on the provided filename to ensure it does not contain malicious path sequences. One possible fix is to use the `os.path.abspath()` function to resolve the path and then check that it is within the intended directory. 

Additionally, consider using a secure way to open files, such as using the `pathlib` library, which provides better support for secure file I/O operations.

Here is an example of how to secure the file I/O:

```python
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    base_path = Path(os.getcwd())
    file_path = base_path / filename

    # Ensure the path is within the intended directory
    if not file_path.is_relative_to(base_path):
        print("Error: invalid filename")
        return

    try:
        with file_path.open('r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")

main()
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
import os
import sys
def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")
main()
```
