VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack because it directly uses user input (sys.argv[1]) to construct the path to a file without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially provide a filename with directory traversal characters (e.g., '../file'), allowing them to access and read files outside of the intended directory.

The use of os.path.normpath() may seem to mitigate this issue, but it only removes redundant directory separators and parent directory references ('..' or '..\') from the path, without verifying the actual path against a base directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper path validation and sanitization. A simple approach is to use the os.path.join() function to construct the path, and ensure the filename is within a specific directory using os.path.abspath() and os.path.dirname(). You can also use a library like `pathlib` for more robust path handling.

Additionally, consider using a more secure way of handling file input, such as whitelisting allowed files or directories. Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent such attacks.

Here's a simple example of improved path handling:

```python
import os
import sys
import pathlib

def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    base_dir = pathlib.Path(os.getcwd())
    file_path = base_dir / filename
    if not file_path.is_relative_to(base_dir):
        print("Error - Invalid file path")
        sys.exit(1)
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")

main()
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  import os
                import sys
                def main():
                  filename = sys.argv[1]
                  path = os.path.normpath(f"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}")
                  try:
                     with open(path, 'r') as f:
                        file_data = f.read()
                 except FileNotFoundError as e:
                    print("Error - file not found")
               main()
