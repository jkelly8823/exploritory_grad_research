VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Deserialization of Exponent Register Bit
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the insecure deserialization of the exponent_reg bit. Specifically, the code checks the value of exponent_reg[0] and performs different operations based on its value. However, the code does not validate the value of exponent_reg before checking its bit. If an attacker can tamper with the value of exponent_reg, they may be able to inject arbitrary values into the mask_reg or result_reg. This could lead to unexpected behavior, potentially causing the function to produce incorrect results or crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate the value of exponent_reg before checking its bit. This can be achieved by adding input validation or sanitization code to ensure that exponent_reg only contains expected values. Additionally, consider using secure deserialization mechanisms or libraries to handle the exponent_reg value.

ORIGINAL CODE:


			...
				module mod_exp
					
					...
					`UPDATE: begin
						
						if (exponent_reg != 'd0) begin
							
							if (exponent_reg[0]) begin
								
								result_reg <= result_next;
								
							end else begin
								
								mask_reg <= result_next;
								
							end
							base_reg <= base_next;
							exponent_reg <= exponent_next;
							state <= `UPDATE;
							
						
					...
					
				endmodule
