VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 6-7 (with SQL Reader)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
    This code is vulnerable to SQL Connection Exception Handling and Potential SQL Injection Attack on the invoiceID.

EXPLANATION:
The code provided creates a new SQL connection, opens it, creates a SQL command, and adds a parameter for preventing SQL Injection. However, the SQL Connection Exception Handling is incomplete as it's missing the necessary exception handling for any issues that occur when trying to connect to the database or reading data. 

Moreover, although SQL parameterization prevents direct SQL Injection, it is also worth noting that the invoiceID can potentially come from user input, and lack of validation might allow malicious input (i.e., extra parameters being added intentionally in the id) even if the SQL command is parameterized.

Lastly, an off-by-one issue might occur as no null checks were performed on objReader before it is going to be used.
  
RECOMMENDATIONS:

   * Handle potential SQL Connection exceptions with try-catch-finally blocks to handle potential errors that occur while connecting to the database or executing the query. 
   * Validate any inputs (like invoiceID.Text) from the users as well as to the potential length of the Data being retrieved. Provide messages when validation fails.
   * Add Null check on objReader before its actual use.
   * Use a close method to free resources.
   * Dispose and close: both are required to avoid leak and keep proper functionality if not reusing the Datareader. At the same use properly block would be nice practice.
   * Ensure DataReader does read records, i.e., include it check DataReader.HasRows when not guaranteed


ORIGINAL CODE:

    conn = new SqlConnection(_ConnectionString);
    conn.Open();
    int16 id = System.Convert.ToInt16(invoiceID.Text);
    SqlCommand query = new SqlCommand( "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = @id", conn);
    query.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", id);
    SqlDataReader objReader = objCommand.ExecuteReader();
