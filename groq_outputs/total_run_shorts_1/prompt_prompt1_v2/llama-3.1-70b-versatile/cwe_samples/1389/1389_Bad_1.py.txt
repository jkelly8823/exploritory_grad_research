VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack.

EXPLANATION:
The `validate_ip_regex` function uses a complex regular expression pattern to validate IP addresses. However, this pattern can be vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, leading to a denial of service attack. An attacker could craft a specially designed string that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive resources and potentially crash the application.

Additionally, the `subprocess.call` function in the `run_ping_regex` function is vulnerable to shell injection attacks. The `validated` IP address is directly concatenated into the command string without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious shell commands by manipulating the input IP address.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the ReDoS vulnerability, consider simplifying the regular expression pattern or using a library that is designed to handle IP address validation securely. For example, you could use the `ipaddress` module in Python, which provides a more secure and efficient way to validate IP addresses.

To fix the shell injection vulnerability, use the `subprocess` module's `stdout` and `stderr` redirection features to prevent the execution of arbitrary shell commands. Alternatively, consider using the `scapy` library to send ICMP packets instead of relying on the `ping` command.

Here's an example of how the `run_ping_regex` function could be modified to fix the shell injection vulnerability:

```python
import subprocess
import re

def run_ping_regex(ip: str):
    validated = validate_ip_regex(ip)
    try:
        # Use stdout and stderr redirection to prevent shell injection attacks
        result = subprocess.check_output(["ping", validated], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        print(result.decode('utf-8'))
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"ping failed with return code {e.returncode}")
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


                      import subprocess
                      import re
                      
                      def validate_ip_regex(ip: str):
                      
                        ip_validator = re.compile(r"((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}")
                        if ip_validator.match(ip):
                        
                          return ip
                        
                        else:
                        
                          raise ValueError("IP address does not match valid pattern.")
                      
                    
                    def run_ping_regex(ip: str):
                      
                        validated = validate_ip_regex(ip)
                        # The ping command treats zero-prepended IP addresses as octal
                        result = subprocess.call(["ping", validated])
                        print(result)
