VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the Struts Validator plugin.

EXPLANATION:
The Struts Validator plugin is configured to load two XML files: `validation-rules.xml` and `validation.xml`. The `set-property` tag's `pathnames` attribute is vulnerable to XXE attacks. This occurs because Struts allows the use of external entities in XML configurations. An attacker could create a malicious XML file that references an external entity, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or server-side request forgery (SSRF).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the XML files (`validation-rules.xml` and `validation.xml`) are validated and do not contain any external entities. 
2. Implement Struts' built-in support for disabling entity expansion by configuring the `input` element to use `resolveEntity` and set the `caching` attribute to `false` in the XML configuration. 
3. Consider using validation rules that do not rely on file-based configurations and instead opt for in-code validation for better security. 
4. Update Struts to the latest version and follow security guidelines to protect against XXE attacks.
