VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The use of a regular expression that attempts to validate input but is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via catastrophic backtracking.

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `/^(\w+\s?)*$/i` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. Catastrophic backtracking occurs when a regular expression contains nested repeating patterns that can cause the regular expression engine to take an exponential amount of time to process the input. In this case, the `\w+\s?` groups together one or more word characters followed by an optional whitespace, and this pattern can be repeated any number of times (`*` quantifier). This allows for an attacker to construct an input that is designed to slow down or hang the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use an anchored regular expression that cannot be backtracked, and use possessive quantifiers instead of greedy ones when possible. However, it seems like the intention is to validate strings to only include words and optional spaces. One recommended solution would be to rewrite the regular expression as `^\w+(?:\s+\w+)*$`. This will only allow one or more sequences of word characters, each possibly separated by whitespace.

ORIGINAL CODE:

               var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
               var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
               var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
