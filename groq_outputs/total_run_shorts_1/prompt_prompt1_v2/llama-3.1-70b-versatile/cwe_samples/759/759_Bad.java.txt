VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of Insecure Hashing Algorithm and Missing Secure Password Storage.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the SHA hashing algorithm to hash the plain text password. However, SHA is not a secure algorithm for password hashing. It is vulnerable to various attacks such as rainbow table attacks, brute-force attacks, and pre-image attacks. Moreover, it calculates the digest using a variable `password`, which seems to be a different variable than the `encer` variable that was declared earlier and used to update the digest. This inconsistency might lead to incorrect digest calculation. Furthermore, the code does not use a secure password storage best practice, such as using a random salt and a strong password hashing algorithm like Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace SHA with a secure password hashing algorithm like Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.
2. Use a secure password storage best practice by generating a random salt and using it in the password hashing process.
3. Ensure that the correct variable is used to calculate the digest.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
// Inconsistent variables used, password vs encer
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn); 
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA"); 
encer.update(plainTextIn); 
byte[] digest = password.digest();

// Insecure password hashing and storage (missing secure password storage best practices)
// Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) { login_user(); }
```
