VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a hash collision attack, timing attack and possible cleartext storage of passwords.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the SHA1 hashing algorithm to store and verify passwords, which is vulnerable to collisions and preimage attacks. SHA1 is also a relatively fast hashing algorithm which can be a problem when hashing passwords as it allows for easier brute force attacks.  Secondly, the equality check `if (equal(ctext, secret_password()))` is done directly on the hash values. This can lead to timing attacks because the comparison time depends on the first mismatch between the comparisons of the hash values.

Furthermore,  'check_passwd' is called with an unhashed and unvalidated password, this can indicate that passwords may be being stored as plaintext. There is no guarantee this happens after a successful authentication, but storing passwords insecurely would have critical vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The hashing function used should be replaced with a more secure one such as Argon2ID or PBKDF2, both designed to work specifically with passwords and hash them safely, limiting the ability to crack and brute-force them. 
When comparing hashed passwords, instead of directly comparing them using `equal`, use a timing-safe comparison function like `memcmp` provided by the platform's standard library to minimize the timing channel vulnerability risk.
Make sure to ensure passwords are properly hashed in secure storage and they are never stored insecurely.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
                        //Login if hash matches stored hash
                        if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}}
