VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Password Storage using MD5 Hashing Algorithm

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to store passwords, which is insecure due to several reasons. Firstly, MD5 is a fast hashing algorithm that can be easily brute-forced using modern computers. This can lead to password disclosure in the event of a data breach. Additionally, the code uses a fixed salt value ("SaltGoesHere"), which means that the same input password will always produce the same hashed output, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. Furthermore, the use of MD5 is not recommended for password storage due to its known weaknesses.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to use a slow and salted hashing algorithm specifically designed for password storage, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed to be computationally expensive and can help prevent brute-force attacks. Additionally, the salt value should be randomly generated and stored along with the hashed password.

As for the code, consider the following fixes:

- Import a suitable hashing library (e.g., bcrypt) and replace MD5 with a slower and more secure algorithm.
- Generate a random salt value for each user and store it along with the hashed password.
- Consider using a more secure password storage scheme, such as one that uses a pepper (a global secret key) in addition to a salt.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
```
