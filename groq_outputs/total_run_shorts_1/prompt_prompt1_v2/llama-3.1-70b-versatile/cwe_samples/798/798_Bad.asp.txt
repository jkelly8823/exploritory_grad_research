VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet includes a connection string with hardcoded credentials (username and password). This is a major security risk because hardcoded credentials can be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals. If an attacker gains access to the code or the configuration file, they will be able to obtain the credentials and use them to access the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using a secure method to store sensitive information such as database credentials. This can include using environment variables, a secrets manager, or a secure configuration file that is not accessible to unauthorized users. If you must include credentials in a configuration file, ensure that the file is encrypted and access is restricted.

Here's an example of how you might implement this:

   <connectionStrings>
    <add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="${DatabaseConnectionString}" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" />
   </connectionStrings>

And then, define the DatabaseConnectionString environment variable or use a secrets manager.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
