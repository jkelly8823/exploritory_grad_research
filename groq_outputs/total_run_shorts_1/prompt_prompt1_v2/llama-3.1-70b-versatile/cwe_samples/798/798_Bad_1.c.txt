VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
Plaintext Password Comparison Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet checks a user-provided password against a hardcoded, unhashed value. This approach poses a significant security risk, as it stores sensitive information (the password) in plaintext. Furthermore, using a hardcoded password for administrative access can be easily discovered by decompiling the binary or accessing the source code, allowing unauthorized individuals to gain elevated privileges. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the hardcoded password is a fixed string ("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b"), which may be easily identifiable as an MD5 hash of a common password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2) to store hashed representations of passwords instead of plaintext values.
- Store the hashed password securely, such as in a secure database or environment variables.
- Compare user-provided passwords against stored hashes using the same hashing algorithm.
- Use a secure method for generating and storing passwords, such as password salting.
- Consider implementing additional security measures, like multi-factor authentication, to protect administrative access.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
                        if (strcmp(password,"68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {
                              
                                 printf("Incorrect Password!\n");return(0);
                           }printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");return(1);
                     }
