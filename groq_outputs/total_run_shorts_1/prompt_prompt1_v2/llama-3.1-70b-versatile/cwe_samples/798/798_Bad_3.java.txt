VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This vulnerability is classified as Hardcoded Sensitive Information.

EXPLANATION:
The property file contains hardcoded sensitive credentials, including a username and password. Hardcoding sensitive information, such as database connections or authentication credentials, exposes an application to unauthorized access and exploitation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the system, potentially leading to data breaches and further exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the properties file.
- Use environment variables, a secrets manager, or a secure configuration management system to manage sensitive information.
- Store sensitive information securely using established protocols, such as encrypted values or hashed passwords.
- Consider implementing a key management system to handle encryption and decryption of sensitive data.
- Limit access to the properties file to authorized personnel and roles, using proper access control and authentication mechanisms.
