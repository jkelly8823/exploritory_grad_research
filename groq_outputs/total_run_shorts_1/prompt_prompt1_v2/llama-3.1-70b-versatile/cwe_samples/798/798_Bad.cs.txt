VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded password.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a hard-coded password ("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b") within the VerifyAdmin function. This password is visible in plain text, which poses a significant security risk. If an attacker gains access to the code, they will immediately have the password. Additionally, it is likely that the hardcoded password is also used in production environments, making it a potential point of exploitation for attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The hardcoded password should be replaced with a secure method of authentication. Here are a few recommendations:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive credentials.
2. Implement a secure password hashing mechanism and store the hashed password in a database. Compare the hashed input with the stored hash during authentication.
3. Use a secure authentication mechanism such as OAuth or JWT authentication.

ORIGINAL CODE:
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {if (password.Equals("68af404b513073584c4b6f22b6c63e6b")) {Console.WriteLine("Entering Diagnostic Mode...");return(1);}Console.WriteLine("Incorrect Password!");return(0);}
