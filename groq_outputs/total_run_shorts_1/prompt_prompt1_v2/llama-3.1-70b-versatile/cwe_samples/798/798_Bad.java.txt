VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Database Credentials 

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials ("scott" and "tiger"), which poses a significant security risk. Hardcoding sensitive information directly into the codebase allows an attacker to easily gain unauthorized access to the database if the code is exposed. This vulnerability violates the principle of least privilege and confidentiality of sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive database credentials securely using environment variables, configuration files, or a secrets management solution. These credentials should be stored outside of the codebase and should not be committed to version control systems.

Here is an example of how to use environment variables to store database credentials:

```java
String username = System.getenv("DB_USERNAME");
String password = System.getenv("DB_PASSWORD");
DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
```

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file or a secrets management solution to securely store and retrieve database credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
...DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");...
```
