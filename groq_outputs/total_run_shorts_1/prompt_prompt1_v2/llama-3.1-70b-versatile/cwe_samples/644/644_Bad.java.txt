VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a potential Header Injection vulnerability. The 'untrustedRawInputData' is being used directly in setting the 'HEADER_NAME' without proper validation or sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The code is directly adding a header to the response with a value obtained from untrusted user input. This could allow a malicious user to manipulate the headers of the response and possibly inject malicious data. For instance, the user could try to inject a new 'Set-Cookie' header, 'Location' header for executing a phishing attack, or try to inject multiple headers with the same name by adding a newline character.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should first validate and sanitize the 'untrustedRawInputData' to ensure it does not contain any malicious data. You can also use a whitelisting approach to only allow certain headers and values to be set in the response. Additionally, consider using a library or a framework that provides a safer way of setting headers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
response.addHeader(HEADER_NAME, untrustedRawInputData);
