VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5, 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to SQL injection and authentication bypass.

EXPLANATION:
The code does not perform adequate validation or sanitization on user input. Specifically, the `AuthenticateUser` function takes as input the `username` and `password` parameters directly from the request. This suggests that the function likely executes SQL queries using these parameters, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Additionally, the code only checks if the user is logged in and if the user is an administrator, but it does not verify if the provided credentials match the stored credentials.

Furthermore, it appears that the code stores sensitive information (such as the logged-in status and username) in cookies without adequate protection. Cookies can be tampered with by an attacker, allowing them to assume the identity of another user.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:
1. Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user input, including the `username` and `password` parameters.
2. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Verify that the provided credentials match the stored credentials, rather than simply relying on a generic authentication function.
4. Consider using a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or JWT, that stores sensitive information securely and verifies user identities accurately.
5. Use secure cookies that are flagged as `HttpOnly` and `Secure` to prevent JavaScript from accessing sensitive cookie data.
6. Consider implementing rate limiting and retry limits for authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
my $q = new CGI;
if ($q->cookie('loggedin') ne "true") {
    if (! AuthenticateUser($q->param('username'), $q->param('password'))) {
        ExitError("Error: you need to log in first");
    } else {
        # Set loggedin and user cookies.
        $q->cookie(-name => 'loggedin',-value => 'true');
        $q->cookie(-name => 'user',-value => $q->param('username'));
    }
}
if ($q->cookie('user') eq "Administrator") {
    DoAdministratorTasks();
}
```
