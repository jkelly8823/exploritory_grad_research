VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8, 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncontrolled string output to user.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from directly passing `test_string` to `printf()` with a `%s` format specifier. This can lead to a format string vulnerability if `test_string` contains format specifiers. Although in the provided code snippet, the contents of `test_string` seem benign, it could potentially be modified elsewhere to contain malicious format specifiers. However, there is still another issue with this code that does make it vulnerable.

In the given code, the variable `test_string` is assigned a different string depending on the value of `i`. If an attacker could control the value of `i` or the address that `err_val` is assigned to, they could potentially cause a segmentation fault or executable code execution in some cases, depending on the type and extent of control they have over input.

However, in this scenario, the main vulnerability introduced is a local DoS vulnerability, which appears to arise due to missing implementation details of `err_val`, `i`, and the purpose of controlling `test_string`. It also introduces potential issues related to dangling or improper pointer initialization (which does not directly contribute to the vulnerability, since in this specific code, it was initialized properly).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- To prevent potential exploitation due to malicious format specifiers, use `printf("%s", test_string)` if possible. Better yet, when dealing with user input, avoid dynamic format specifiers altogether (`printf()` and friends) and use string manipulation and combination functions instead.
- Consider the source of `i` and ensure it's properly sanitized to prevent any value that could point to a non-constant memory location for test_string.
- Ensure that `err_val` cannot be modified or exploited externally.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char *test_string;
if (i != err_val)
{
test_string = "Hello World!";
}
else {
test_string = "Done on the other side!";
}
printf("%s", test_string);
```
