VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a method declaration for the `clone()` method, which is a common method used to create a copy of an object. The method is declared as `protected` and throws `CloneNotSupportedException` which indicates that it correctly handles the potential exception thrown when an object cannot be cloned.

There is no apparent vulnerability in this code snippet. However, it is worth noting that implementing the `clone()` method correctly can be complex and involves many considerations. But given this snippet alone, there is no immediate vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {...}
