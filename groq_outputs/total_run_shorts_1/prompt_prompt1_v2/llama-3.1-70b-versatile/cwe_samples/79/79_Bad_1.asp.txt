VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the SQL query construction. The query string is concatenated with a variable 'eid' without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the value of 'eid'. For instance, if 'eid' is set to '1 OR 1=1', the query would return all rows in the 'emp' table, potentially leading to unauthorized data access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using parameterized SQL queries or stored procedures to prevent injection of malicious SQL code. The 'eid' variable should be treated as a parameter and passed to the query using a parameterized approach.

Here's an example of how the query can be rewritten using a parameterized approach:
```csharp
string query = "select * from emp where id=@eid";
sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);
sda.SelectCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@eid", eid);
```
This approach ensures that the 'eid' value is treated as a parameter and not as part of the SQL code, preventing SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```sql
<%protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label EmployeeName;...string query = "select * from emp where id=" + eid;sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, conn);sda.Fill(dt);string name = dt.Rows[0]["Name"];...EmployeeName.Text = name;%><p><asp:label id="EmployeeName" runat="server" /></p>
```
