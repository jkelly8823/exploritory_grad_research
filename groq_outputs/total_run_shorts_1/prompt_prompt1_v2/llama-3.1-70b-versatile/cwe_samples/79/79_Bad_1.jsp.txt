VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a SQL Injection attack.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly concatenates the user input (eid) into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The vulnerability is present in the line where the SQL query is executed. The query is directly building the string with user input (eid), which can be exploited by an attacker by manipulating the input.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of directly concatenating user input into the SQL query. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code.

Here's an example of the recommended fix:

```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from emp where id = ?");
pstmt.setInt(1, eid);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

Additionally, consider validating and sanitizing user input to prevent other types of attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
<%Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);if (rs != null) {rs.next();String name = rs.getString("name");}%>
                     Employee Name: <%= name %>
```
