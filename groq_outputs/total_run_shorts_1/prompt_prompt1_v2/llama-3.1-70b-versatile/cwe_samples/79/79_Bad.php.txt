VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to the direct output of user-controlled data without sanitization.

EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves the 'username' parameter from the URL query string using the $_GET superglobal in PHP and directly outputs it within an HTML context. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code as a 'username' parameter, which would be executed by the victim's browser when the page is loaded. The fact that the user input is not validated, sanitized, or encoded properly before being output makes it vulnerable to XSS.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, proper input validation and sanitization should be performed on the 'username' parameter before it is output. Here is an example of how to do this using PHP's built-in functions:

```php
$username = htmlentities($_GET['username']);
echo '<div class="header"> Welcome, ' . $username . '</div>';
```

Or, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries if the 'username' is being stored or retrieved from a database.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$username = $_GET['username'];echo '<div class="header"> Welcome, ' . $username . '</div>';
```
