VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unvalidated and unsanitized user input.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses a servlet request's getParameter() function to retrieve the 'eid' parameter from the request and directly outputs it to the webpage without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially compromising the security of the application and its users.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user input data using a whitelist approach to ensure it only contains expected and allowed characters.
2. Use a templating engine or output encoding function to escape any special characters and prevent malicious code injection. 
3. Implement measures to prevent injection of malicious data, such as using a Content Security Policy (CSP) and setting proper HTTP headers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>...Employee ID: <%= eid %>
