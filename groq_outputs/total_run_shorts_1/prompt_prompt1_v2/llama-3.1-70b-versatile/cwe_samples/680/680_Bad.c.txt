VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory leak due to unchecked allocated memory. 

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `table_ptr` using `malloc`, but it does not check if the allocation was successful. If the memory allocation fails, `malloc` will return a null pointer, which can lead to a segmentation fault when trying to access the memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Always check the return value of `malloc` to ensure the allocation was successful. Additionally, do not forget to free the allocated memory when it is no longer needed. 

```c
img_t* table_ptr; /* Declare as a pointer */
...int num_imgs;...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = malloc(sizeof(img_t) * num_imgs);
if (table_ptr == NULL) {
    // Handle the error, for example:
    fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
    exit(1);
}
// Don't forget to free the allocated memory when it's no longer needed
// free(table_ptr);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
...
```
