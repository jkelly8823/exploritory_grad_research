VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack due to the direct use of user-supplied data in the `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` variable.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly uses the `REMOTE_ADDR` value, which can be spoofed by an attacker. In a typical PHP setup, `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` contains the IP address of the client machine that is connecting to the server. However, this value can be spoofed using techniques such as IP spoofing or by manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header in the request.

In this case, the code uses the `REMOTE_ADDR` value to check if the client's IP address is in the allow list, but an attacker could potentially bypass this check by sending a forged request with a spoofed `REMOTE_ADDR` value.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the check `in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)` is dependent on the content of the `$ipAllowList` array, which is not defined in this snippet. However, for the purposes of this analysis, it's assumed that the `$ipAllowList` array contains a list of trusted IP addresses.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always validate and sanitize user-supplied data before using it in your code.
2. Instead of relying solely on `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`, consider checking other server variables such as `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']` or using a load balancer that sets the correct client IP address.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as validating the IP address format using a regular expression and checking the IP address against multiple allow lists.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){
    echo "You are not authorized to view this page";
    http_redirect($errorPageURL);
}
$status = getServerStatus();
echo $status;
