VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Mixing Memory Management APIs

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a mixing of memory management APIs. The 'malloc' function is used to allocate memory, but then 'delete' is used to deallocate the memory. This can cause undefined behavior in C++ because 'delete' is not compatible with 'malloc'. In C++, 'delete' should only be used with memory allocated by 'new'. The 'free' function should be used to deallocate memory allocated by 'malloc'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the 'delete' statement should be replaced with a call to the 'free' function. This ensures that the correct deallocation function is used for the allocated memory. Alternatively, the 'malloc' function should be replaced with the 'new' operator to be consistent with the 'delete' operator.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  class A {void foo();};void A::foo(){int *ptr;ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));delete ptr;}
