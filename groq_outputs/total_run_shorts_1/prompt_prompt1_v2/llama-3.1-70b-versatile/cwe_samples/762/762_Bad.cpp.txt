VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: All (the snippet in its entirety is problematic)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a vulnerability related to memory management using `new` and `free`. The use of `free` to deallocate memory allocated with `new` is incorrect.

EXPLANATION:
In C++, `new` and `delete` are the correct pair for memory management. `free` is used with `malloc`, but in this case, the memory was allocated using `new`. This inconsistency will lead to undefined behavior when `free` is called, as the implementation of `new` and `free` may differ in how they manage memory. 

Moreover, even if the correct pairing was used, this snippet still demonstrates an unnecessary manual memory management strategy. Manually handling memory in this manner is not exception-safe and could result in memory leaks if an exception occurs before `free` is called.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace `free(ptr)` with `delete ptr` to correct the memory management pairing.
2. Consider using smart pointers instead of raw pointers and manual memory management to guarantee memory safety and exception safety.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    free(ptr);
}
```
