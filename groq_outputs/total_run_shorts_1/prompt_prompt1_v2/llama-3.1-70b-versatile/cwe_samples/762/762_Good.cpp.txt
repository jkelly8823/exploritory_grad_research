VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential memory leak vulnerability is present, as well as a potential exception safety issue.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, a new `BarObj` is dynamically allocated using `new`. However, it is not handled properly, which could lead to a memory leak or exception safety issues. Specifically, if an exception is thrown during the "do some work with ptr here" section, the `delete` statement will not be executed, resulting in memory leaks. Additionally, if the `delete` statement is not aligned with the scope of the dynamically allocated `BarObj`, there is potential for a doubly allocated object or dangling pointer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this issue, we recommend using a smart pointer (preferably `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) to manage the dynamically allocated `BarObj`. This would ensure proper memory deallocation even if an exception occurs. 

```cpp
void foo() {
    std::unique_ptr<BarObj> ptr(new BarObj());
    /* do some work with ptr here */
    ...
    // No need for delete ptr; smart pointer will handle it
}
```
Alternatively, consider using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom, or at least using a `try-catch` block to ensure proper memory deallocation in case of exceptions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
void foo(){
    BarObj *ptr = new BarObj()
       /* do some work with ptr here */
       
       ...
       delete ptr;
}
```
