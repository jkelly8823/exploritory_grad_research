VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a logical bug due to a typo in the conditional statement.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, the `isValid` function checks if the input `value` meets a certain condition. However, instead of using the equality operator (`==`) for comparison, a single equals sign (`=`) is used for assignment. As a result, the function will always assign `value` to 100 and interpret the assigned value as a boolean, leading to incorrect results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, replace the assignment operator (`=`) with the equality operator (`==`) for comparing values.

```c
int isValid(int value) {
    if (value == 100) {
        printf("Value is valid\n");
        return(1);
    }
    printf("Value is not valid\n");
    return(0);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
```
