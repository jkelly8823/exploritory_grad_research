VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in this code snippet is an incorrect assignment operator in the if statement condition, which leads to a potential unintended behavior.

EXPLANATION:
In the if statement condition, `foo = 1` is used. The single equals sign `=` is the assignment operator, which assigns the value 1 to `foo`. This is not equivalent to checking if `foo` is equal to 1. In C, to check for equality, the double equals sign `==` should be used. This error can cause the if statement to always evaluate to true, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the assignment operator `=` should be replaced with the equality operator `==` in the if statement condition. The corrected line should read as follows:
```c
if (foo == 1) printf("foo\n");
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
void called(int foo){if (foo=1) printf("foo\n");}int main() {
    //                       called(2);return 0;
}
```
