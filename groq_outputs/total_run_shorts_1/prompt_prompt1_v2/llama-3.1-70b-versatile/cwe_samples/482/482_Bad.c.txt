VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in push() function
EXPLANATION:
The push() function increments the p1 pointer without properly checking for buffer overflow. Although there is a check for p1 reaching the end of the stack, it does not prevent writing to the location before the increment operation. In C, the assignment operation `*p1 == i;` is being performed before the increment operation. This can be further explained by the order of operations in C: increment operator `++` has a higher precedence than the assignment operator `==`. This creates an issue where an attacker can potentially overflow the buffer and overwrite adjacent memory locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the increment operation happens before the assignment. The corrected line of code would be:

*p1 = i; p1++;

Another approach to prevent buffer overflow is to increment the pointer only after checking the boundaries and assign the value only if it is within the valid range.

```c
void push(int i) {
    if (p1 < (tos + SIZE)) {
        *p1 = i;
        p1++;
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
                  #define SIZE 50
int *tos, *p1, stack[SIZE];

void push(int i) {
    p1++;
    if(p1==(tos+SIZE)) {

         // Print stack overflow error message and exit

    }
    *p1 == i;
}

int pop(void) {
    if(p1==tos) {

        // Print stack underflow error message and exit

    }
    p1--;
    return *(p1+1);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    // initialize tos and p1 to point to the top of stack
    tos = stack;
    p1 = stack;
    // code to add and remove items from stack
    ...return 0;
}
```
