VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by providing a specially crafted input for the street variable.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that user input (street) is directly concatenated into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by providing input that includes SQL syntax, such as quotes, semicolons, or SQL keywords. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even deletion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the query string. This can be achieved by using the `setParameter` or `setParameterList` methods provided by the Hibernate Query API. Here is an example of how the code can be modified:

```java
String street = getStreetFromUser();
Query query = session.createQuery("from Address a where a.street = :street");
query.setParameter("street", street);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
String street = getStreetFromUser();Query query = session.createQuery("from Address a where a.street='" + street + "'");
