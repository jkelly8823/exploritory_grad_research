VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an Intent Hijacking attack. 

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the use of an implicit Intent with an ACTION string ("com.example.BackupUserData") and granting read permission to the file URI with FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION. An attacker could exploit this by creating an app that registers for the same ACTION string and intercepts this Intent. This could lead to unauthorized data access or other malicious activities. 

In this specific case, we are assuming that the Intent is supposed to be directed to a specific app or service under the control of the same developer. However, as written, it will be broadcast to any app that has registered a receiver for this ACTION string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this, the developer should use an explicit Intent (one that is directed to a specific receiver class or package), rather than an implicit Intent. Additionally, instead of granting permission with FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION, the developer should use a different approach to share data between apps such as ContentProvider with proper permissions. Alternatively, if the receiver is under the same developer's control, they should use PendingIntent to verify that only the desired app handles the Intent.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction("com.example.BackupUserData");
intent.setData(file_uri);
intent.addFlags(FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
sendBroadcast(intent);
