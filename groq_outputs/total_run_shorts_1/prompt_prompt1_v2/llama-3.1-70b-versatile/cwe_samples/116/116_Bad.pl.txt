VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated User Input to Execute Arbitrary System Commands

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet reads input from a handle, splits it into separate commands based on the "|" character, and executes specific functions based on the operator in the command. However, the code does not validate or sanitize the input before passing it to the `ExecuteBan` and `ExecuteSay` functions. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious commands or data that can cause unwarranted system behavior. Furthermore, if the `ExecuteBan` and `ExecuteSay` functions execute system commands using the input data without proper validation or escaping, this can lead to a Command Injection vulnerability. The `UrlDecode` function is used, which may indicate that the input data is expected to be URL-encoded, but it does not prevent an attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input data before passing it to the `ExecuteBan` and `ExecuteSay` functions. Use whitelisting to only allow specific, expected operators and data.
2. Ensure that the `ExecuteBan` and `ExecuteSay` functions properly validate and escape any system commands or data that they execute, to prevent command injection attacks.
3. Consider logging and monitoring system calls and input data to detect potential security incidents.
4. Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks if the input data is also used for database interactions.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```perl
$inputString = readLineFromFileHandle($serverFH);
 
# generate an array of strings separated by the "|" character.
@commands = split(/\|/, $inputString);
foreach $cmd (@commands) {
 
# separate the operator from its arguments based on a single whitespace
($operator, $args) = split(/ /, $cmd, 2);
$args = UrlDecode($args);
if ($operator eq "BAN") {ExecuteBan($args);}
elsif ($operator eq "SAY") {ExecuteSay($args);}
}
```
