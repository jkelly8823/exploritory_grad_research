VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs because the code directly outputs the value of the `email` variable, which is obtained from the `request.getParameter` method. This method gets its value from the HTTP request, making it potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code as part of the `email` parameter, which will then be executed by the browser, allowing them to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or hijack the user's session.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use proper output encoding when displaying the `email` variable. You can use a library like OWASP ESAPI to escape and validate user input. Here is a recommended fix:
```java
<%
    String email = request.getParameter("email");
    String encodedEmail = org.owasp.esapi.Validator.escapeForHTML(email);
%>
...Email Address: <%= encodedEmail %>
```
Or, if using JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library), you can use `<c:out>` tag, which escapes the output by default:
```xml
<c:out value="${email}"/>
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```html
<% String email = request.getParameter("email"); %>
...Email Address: <%= email %>
```
