VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the `doit` subroutine, the `system` function is used to execute a command that includes the `uname` variable, which is obtained from an untrusted source (`GetUntrustedInput`). The `encode` function is used to sanitize the input, but it only escapes HTML special characters, not shell metacharacters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands, potentially leading to code execution or other security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a safe and secure way to execute system commands, such as using the `IPC::Run` or `Capture::Tiny` modules, or by using a safer alternative to the `system` function, such as `fork` and `exec`. Additionally, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the input data to prevent any malicious characters from being executed.

Alternatively, consider using the following code to prevent command injection:

```perl
sub doit {
    my $uname = encode(GetUntrustedInput("username"));
    print "<b>Welcome, $uname!</b><p>\n";
    my @command = ('/bin/ls', '-l', "/home/$uname");
    system(@command);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```perl
sub GetUntrustedInput {return($ARGV[0]);}
sub encode {my($str) = @_;$str =~ s/\&/\&amp;/gs;$str =~ s/\"/\&quot;/gs;$str =~ s/\'/\&apos;/gs;$str =~ s/\</\&lt;/gs;$str =~ s/\>/\&gt;/gs;return($str);}
sub doit {my $uname = encode(GetUntrustedInput("username"));print "<b>Welcome, $uname!</b><p>\n";system("cd /home/$uname; /bin/ls -l");}
```
