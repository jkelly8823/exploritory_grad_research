VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, also known as a directory climbing attack or a dot-dot-slash attack. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access and manipulate files and directories outside of the intended directory.

The vulnerability arises because the code takes untrusted input from GetUntrustedInput() and uses it to construct a filename without proper validation or sanitization. Although the code attempts to mitigate the vulnerability by removing '../' prefixes from the input, this is insufficient. An attacker can still use various techniques to bypass this mitigation, such as:

- Using multiple '../' paths to traverse multiple levels of directories
- Using absolute paths to access files outside of the intended directory
- Using encoded or URL-encoded directory separators

The ReadAndSendFile function may also reveal sensitive information or allow an attacker to manipulate files and directories on the system, leading to potential security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following recommendations are suggested:

- Validate and sanitize user input more thoroughly. This can be achieved by whitelisting allowed characters and patterns, rather than trying to detect and block specific malicious patterns.
- Use a more secure method for storing and serving files. For example, use a separate, isolated storage system or a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Use absolute paths or canonical paths for file system operations to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Review and secure the ReadAndSendFile function to prevent file system manipulation and information disclosure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();if (substr($Username, 0, 3) eq '../') {$Username = substr($Username, 3);}my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
