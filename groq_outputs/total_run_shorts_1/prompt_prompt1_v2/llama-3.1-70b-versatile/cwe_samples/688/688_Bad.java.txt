VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure direct object reference vulnerability and possibly incorrect method invocation.


EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to incorrect method invocation. The method 'accessGranted' is declared twice, once with 'String user' as the second parameter and another with 'String[] userRoles'. However, when calling the method recursively, it calls itself with 'ADMIN_ROLES' which is a String array. But the method is invoked with parameters (resource, ADMIN_ROLES), which may be called from 'accessGranted(String resource, String user)' thus changing the method invocation to the one that accepts (resource, userRoles).

This could also imply that there could be an insecure direct object reference vulnerability where any user can access data meant for 'ADMIN_ROLES'. It might have been intended to do this but in a production system this could be a vulnerability as this data may not be meant for all users.

Moreover, the presence of two methods with the 'private boolean void' access specifier seems to be incorrect because Java does not allow 'void' keyword along with return type, this looks more like an incorrect or incomplete snippet. This might not be the fault of the developer using this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the analysis above, the recommendation would be to correct the method declaration by removing the 'void' keyword as it seems this is not the intention here. Also, ensure that method invocation is correct as intended. 

Moreover, review the data that you are returning, and make sure it's valid for all users.

Also consider implementing secure access controls like RBAC (Role Based Access Control) for proper access control.

Here is the corrected code:

private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...;

private boolean accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
    // grant or deny access based on user roles
    // rest of the code here...
}

public boolean accessGranted(String resource, String user) {
    String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user);
    return accessGranted(resource, userRoles);
}

ORIGINAL CODE:
private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...;
public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user) {String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user);return accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES);}
private boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
    // grant or deny access based on user roles
    ...
}
