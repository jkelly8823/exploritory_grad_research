Information Disclosure through Custom Error Messages

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a web application's configuration settings, specifically ASP.NET. The customErrors mode is set to "On", which is a good practice to prevent attackers from getting detailed error information. However, the defaultRedirect attribute points to a generic error page named "YourErrorPage.htm". This might not be optimal because in a live production environment, revealing the names of error pages, or the existence of certain pages, might help an attacker understand more about the infrastructure of your application or the architecture or how it is setup. 

In addition, this might pose a problem when there is a potential web.config configuration flip. If the setting gets inadvertently flipped to "Off" or "RemoteOnly" for remote traffic for example, any actual .NET stacktrace could potentially reveal much more detailed information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Set customErrors mode to "On" and define generic error pages with HTTP status codes:
Instead of defaultRedirect, consider setting specific redirects for different HTTP status codes using the "error" tag, like so:
 <customErrors mode="On">
        <error statusCode="404" redirect="NotFound.htm"/>
        <error statusCode="403" redirect="AccessDenied.htm"/>
 </customErrors>
 
 Make sure you never set customErrors mode to "Off" or "RemoteOnly" in a production environment.

Make sure all error pages handle security-related concerns such as session invalidation after encountering an error, as some applications may handle sessions differently.

Avoid showing detailed error information to external users.
