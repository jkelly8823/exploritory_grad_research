VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The use of "RemoteOnly" mode for custom errors in ASP.NET can potentially disclose sensitive information about the web application.

EXPLANATION:
The "RemoteOnly" mode for custom errors in ASP.NET is a default setting that allows detailed error messages to be displayed on the local machine, while generic error messages are displayed to remote users. However, this setting can be vulnerable to information disclosure, as it allows attackers to potentially glean information about the web application's configuration, file structure, or internal mechanics by exploiting error conditions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to set the custom errors mode to "Off" or "On" with a generic error page. This will help prevent the disclosure of sensitive information about the web application. Additionally, it is recommended to log detailed error messages to a secure location for debugging and analysis purposes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" />
