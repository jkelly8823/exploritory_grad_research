VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a custom error handling configuration in a potentially insecure state. The `customErrors mode` is set to `Off`, which may cause detailed error messages, including sensitive information about the application, to be displayed to end-users or even attackers. These error messages can include stack traces, application version information, or even worse, detailed database information, which can be leveraged by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of disabling custom error handling, it is recommended to set the `mode` to `On` or `RemoteOnly`, depending on the desired level of error reporting. When set to `On`, custom error messages will be displayed for all users, providing a more controlled and secure error handling experience. When set to `RemoteOnly`, custom error messages will be displayed for remote users, but detailed error messages will be displayed for local users, which can be useful for debugging purposes. It is also recommended to define custom error pages to handle errors in a more controlled and secure way.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```xml
<customErrors mode="Off" />
