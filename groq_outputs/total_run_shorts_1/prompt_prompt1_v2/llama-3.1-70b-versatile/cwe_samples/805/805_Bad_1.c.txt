VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None, since the specific line of vulnerability cannot be pinpointed without the definition and implementation of returnChunkSize(void *) and the relevant buffer boundaries of destBuf and srcBuf.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow due to lack of validation in the return value of returnChunkSize(void *) before using it in memcpy.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment shows a call to returnChunkSize(destBuf) inside memcpy, which is used to determine the amount of data to be copied. However, if the return value of returnChunkSize(destBuf) is not validated to check for potential error conditions (which might be indicated by a return value of -1), and if this value is directly passed to memcpy, it could lead to a buffer overflow if (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1) exceeds the actual size of the destination buffer. Furthermore, simply subtracting 1 from the return value may not be enough to prevent buffer overflow, as the returned value could be very close to the buffer's capacity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of returnChunkSize(destBuf) before passing it to memcpy, and handle potential error cases.
   For example:

   ```c
int chunkSize = returnChunkSize(destBuf);
if (chunkSize - 1 > sizeof(destBuf)) {
    // Handle error: potential buffer overflow
} else {
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, chunkSize - 1);
}
```

2. Verify that returnChunkSize(void *) function accurately returns the usable size of memory in destBuf and accounts for proper error handling.

3. Validate that both source and destination buffer sizes match the intended data transfer between them.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int returnChunkSize(void *) {
    /* if chunk info is valid, return the size of usable memory,
    * else, return -1 to indicate an error
    */
    ...
}

int main() {
    ...
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));
    ...
}
```
