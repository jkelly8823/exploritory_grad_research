VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect usage of strncpy.

EXPLANATION:
In the code snippet, strncpy is used to copy the contents of the source array into the dest array. However, the third argument to strncpy, which is the maximum number of characters that can be copied, is specified as sizeof(source)-1. This is problematic because the sizeof() operator returns the total size of the source array in bytes, which may include padding bytes or null terminators. If the source array is longer than the dest array, using sizeof(source)-1 as the count can still lead to overflowing the dest array.

Furthermore, the length of the source array (21) is longer than the dest array (12). This implies a buffer overflow vulnerability if the length of the string to be copied is greater than the length of the dest array. Even though a null terminator would normally prevent the overflow, the code calls strncpy with the same amount of characters (sizeof(source)-1) and does not append a null terminator, which is out of the scope of this given snippet but should be noted when dealing with CStrings. 

However, I'm only analyzing the code that I'm provided and it looks like the programmer may have dodged one potential issue with a potential exploit if he actually succeeded preventing code from potentially running past the buffer.

Finally,  strncpy  in the C standard library function is a potentially unsafe version and  C  will not produce any diagnostic messages if a large number of characters is copied past the end of  dest . 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use strncpy_s instead, which is a safer alternative, if possible. The '_s' suffix indicates it's a safe, more modern implementation of old C library's 'strncpy' function. strncopy_s takes as its parameters, the destination string ptr, size of dest, the source string ptr, and size of source.
2. Use strlen for measuring lengths of character arrays to pass as the third parameter for 'strncpy' as this function does not include a null terminator. Taking into account not copying past the buffer size while still taking a full copy up to the length of the given source array.   
3. Use a more modern library such as 'std::string' or if this is the case use 'std::string::c_str()' or more specifically 'std::string::strcpy() if dealing with arrays of characters.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
...char source[21] = "the character string";char dest[12];strncpy(dest, source, sizeof(source)-1);...
