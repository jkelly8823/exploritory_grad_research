Insecure Seeding of PRNG and Potential Information Disclosure

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet generates 2 bytes of randomness using `os.urandom(2)` and uses it to seed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) with `random.seed(a=seed)`. This is insufficient because the PRNG can be easily predicted if it's seeded with a short, predictable seed value. Moreover, using only 2 bytes (16 bits) for seeding the PRNG is insecure, as it significantly reduces the entropy of the PRNG. This can lead to predictable random values.

Furthermore, the generated key is only 128 bits, which is too small for cryptographic purposes. A good cryptographic key should be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) in size to be secure against brute-force attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a larger and more secure random seed. The minimum recommended seed size is 32 bytes.
2. Use a cryptographically secure PRNG such as `secrets` module in Python.
3. Ensure the generated key is at least 256 bits (32 bytes) in size.

The corrected code snippet would look like this:
```python
import secrets

# generating 32 bytes of randomness for the seeding the PRNG 
seed = secrets.token_bytes(32)
random.seed(a=seed)
key = secrets.randbits(256) # or use os.urandom(32) to generate a 32-byte key
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
				 # getting 2 bytes of randomness for the seeding the PRNG 
				 seed = os.urandom(2)
				 random.seed(a=seed)
				 key = random.getrandbits(128)
