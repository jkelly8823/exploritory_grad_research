Insecure Certificate Validation

EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be checking the verification result of an SSL certificate. However, it is only checking if the verification result is equal to `X509_V_OK`, which indicates that the certificate was successfully verified. Nevertheless, this check alone is not sufficient for secure certificate validation. There are other verification results, such as `X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED`, `X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID`, `X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED`, etc., that could also be valid but are not being checked. This could potentially lead to an attacker being able to present a self-signed certificate or an expired certificate that would not be detected by this code.

Additionally, it would be recommended to check the identity of the certificate as well, to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The identifier to check depends on the specifics of the application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Instead of only checking for `X509_V_OK`, check that the verification result is not one of the other error values that indicate the certificate is invalid.
2. Check the identity of the certificate to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The exact check will depend on the specifics of the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);if (cert && (SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)==X509_V_OK)) {
    // do secret things
}
```
