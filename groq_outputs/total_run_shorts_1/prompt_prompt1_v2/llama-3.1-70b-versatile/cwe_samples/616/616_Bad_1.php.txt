VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Unvalidated User Input

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and Unvalidated User Input. The `$_FILES` superglobal in PHP stores information about uploaded files. An attacker might manipulate the filename and temporary filename to potentially access or overwrite sensitive files on the server. Additionally, using user-provided input directly, especially from `$_FILES`, without proper validation and sanitization can lead to security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it's essential to validate and sanitize the user-provided filename. Use `basename` and `pathinfo` functions to extract the filename and ensure no malicious paths or characters are present. Also, ensure that the temporary filename generated by the server is secure. Always store uploaded files in a secure directory with proper access controls.

Here's a basic example of validation:
```php
$upload_dir = '/path/to/upload/directory/';
$tmp_file = $_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'];
$filename = pathinfo($_FILES['userfile']['name'], PATHINFO_FILENAME);
$sanitized_filename = basename($filename);
$target_file = $upload_dir . $sanitized_filename;

// further checks can be applied here...

// store file securely
move_uploaded_file($tmp_file, $target_file);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  $_FILES['userfile']['name'] - original filename from client
$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'] - the temp filename of the file on the server
