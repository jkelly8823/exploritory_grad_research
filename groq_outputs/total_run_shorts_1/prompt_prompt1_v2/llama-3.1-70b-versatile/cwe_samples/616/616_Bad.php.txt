VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Variable Validation and User Input Handled Directly Without Sanitization

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet directly assigns user-inputted values to variables without any input validation or sanitization. Variables such as `$varname`, `$varname_size`, `$varname_name`, and `$varname_type` are assigned values without any security checks. This lack of input validation could lead to vulnerabilities such as arbitrary file inclusion, insecure direct object references, or other types of file-related vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Validate User-Input**: Implement thorough validation for the user-provided data including file names, sizes, and MIME types. Ensure that these values adhere to specific patterns, formats, and constraints (e.g., maximum file size, allowed file extensions).

2. **Sanitize User-Input**: After validation, sanitize the user-provided data by removing or encoding special characters, HTML tags, and potential scripting patterns. This helps to prevent file path traversal and injection attacks.

3. **Prevent Client-Controlled File Modification**: Use a secure upload mechanism, and store uploaded files in a non-executable directory. When serving the file, use a secure, indirect reference, such as a mapping of file IDs to names.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$varname = name of the temporary file on local machine
$varname_size = size of file
$varname_name = original name of file provided by client
$varname_type = MIME type of the file
```
