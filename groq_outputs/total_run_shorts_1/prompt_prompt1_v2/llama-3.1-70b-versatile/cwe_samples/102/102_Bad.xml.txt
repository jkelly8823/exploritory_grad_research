VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Duplicate Form IDs
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains two forms with the same name "ProjectForm" within the same formset. This is a vulnerability because it can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior when handling form data or performing actions on the forms.

In most cases, form names are also used as IDs, and having duplicate IDs in HTML is not only invalid according to the HTML specification but can also lead to security issues. For example, if JavaScript code is used to interact with the forms, it may not behave as expected if there are multiple forms with the same ID.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to ensure that each form within the formset has a unique name (and ID). If the forms need to share a common identifier, consider using a class name or a data attribute.

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm1"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm2"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```

Alternatively, if the forms are supposed to be identical and part of a collection, consider using an array or a list name, and then index or iterate over the forms using JavaScript.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
<form-validation>
  <formset>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
    <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
  </formset>
</form-validation>
```
