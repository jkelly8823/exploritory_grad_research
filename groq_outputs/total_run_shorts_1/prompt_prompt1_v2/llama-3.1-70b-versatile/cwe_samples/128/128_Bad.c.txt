VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Allocation of Memory.
EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `table_ptr` using `malloc`, but it does not check for a potential integer overflow that may occur when calculating `sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs`. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, as the program may attempt to allocate an unexpectedly large amount of memory, causing the system to crash or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Furthermore, the code does not check the return value of `malloc` for error conditions, such as when the allocation fails due to lack of available memory. This can lead to a null pointer dereference vulnerability, as the program may attempt to use `table_ptr` without checking if the memory allocation was successful.

Additionally, the code uses a type-cast, `(img_t*)`, which may mask an implicit type conversion warning. If `img_t` is not compatible with `void*`, this may lead to undefined behavior when storing data in the allocated memory.

Lastly, the magic number 10kB is not present in the provided code snippet, but assuming it's somewhere else in the code, if not defined properly using a define constant or configured dynamically from a configurable location, it might make this integer valued size prone to error.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability:

1. Perform bounds checking on `num_imgs` and `sizeof(img_t)` before allocating memory to prevent integer overflows.
2. Check the return value of `malloc` for error conditions (i.e., null) and handle these conditions accordingly.
3. Use portable type conversions (i.e., explicit type-casting is not recommended).
4. Prefer heap debugging tools to help identify and debug heap-related issues.
5. Consider using functions like `calloc()` to allocate memory, especially for arrays, if you plan to store integers (unsigned or signed) or floats or doubles in places you allocated.
6. On platforms that support address sanitizer, a run-time check might help identify the correct place to store img data without invoking overflow error

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/
int num_imgs;
...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
```
