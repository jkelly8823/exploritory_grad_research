VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Blanket Exception Handling

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains an instance of blanket exception handling. The catch block includes an exception type (RareException), but it does not have any code within the block to handle the exception. This is often referred to as a "swallowing" the exception, because it is caught but not acted upon. Additionally, there is a comment indicating that this exception can never happen, but if that is the case then it might be better to throw a more informative error rather than catching and swallowing it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should either remove the try-catch block if the exception is genuinely impossible to occur or properly handle the exception within the catch block. This could include logging the exception to help you diagnose and debug problems or even properly responding to the error within your application.

Additionally, as an added protective measure against blanket exception handling, you can log or track the caught exceptions in order to ensure that they are being properly handled and not being unintentionally swallowed.

Also note that in Java, you would usually handle the exception in a more specific manner, as the RareException might extend a more general exception, which you would need to account for.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                 try {doExchange();}catch (RareException e) {
                        
                           
                           // this can never happen
                           
                        
                     }
               
 ```
