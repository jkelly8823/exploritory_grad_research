VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The code directly outputs the value of `$status` which is obtained from the `getServerStatus()` function, without any sanitization or encoding. If the `$status` variable contains user-controlled data or is not properly validated, it could lead to an XSS attack. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, which could then be executed by the client's browser.

Additionally, the use of `http_redirect()` function with a user-controlled value stored in `$errorPageURL` could lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability, if `$errorPageURL` is not properly validated. However, this is not directly visible in the provided snippet.

Another issue is that the `http_redirect()` function is used without proper exit or die() after its call. This can lead to further code execution and potential security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent XSS, any data that is directly output to the browser should be sanitized using `htmlspecialchars()` function or similar. If the `$status` variable contains user-controlled data, it should be validated and sanitized before being output.

Additionally, it's recommended to use a more secure redirect method, such as using `header()` function with a `Location` header and `exit()` or `die()` function to prevent further code execution. 

Moreover, it's recommended to validate and sanitize the `$errorPageURL` variable to prevent Open Redirect vulnerability.

To stop the code execution after redirect, use `exit()` or `die()` after `http_redirect()` call.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page";http_redirect($errorPageURL);}$status = getServerStatus();echo $status;
```
Example of fixed code:
```
$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){echo "You are not authorized to view this page"; header('Location: ' . $errorPageURL ); exit();}$status = getServerStatus();echo htmlspecialchars($status);
```
