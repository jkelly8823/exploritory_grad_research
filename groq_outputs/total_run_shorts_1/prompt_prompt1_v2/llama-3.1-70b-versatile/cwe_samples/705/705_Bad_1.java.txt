VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper Error Handling with System.exit() call

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a vulnerability in the error handling mechanism within the doPost method. When an ApplicationSpecificException occurs, the code logs the error and then calls System.exit(1), which terminates the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) immediately. This abrupt termination can lead to loss of data, corruption of the application state, and even compromise the security of the application, as it might be used to avoid cleanup of sensitive data or operations. 

Moreover, by using System.exit(), the application bypasses the standard termination protocol and fails to properly close system resources, such as sockets, files, or database connections, potentially leading to resource leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using System.exit(), it is recommended to handle the exception in a way that allows the application to properly shut down and clean up resources. For example:

- Log the error and let the exception propagate upwards to a higher-level error handler that can manage the application's termination properly.
- Use a finally block to ensure that resources are properly closed and released before terminating the application.
- Use a shutdown hook to perform necessary cleanup operations before the JVM terminates.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {...} 
    catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
