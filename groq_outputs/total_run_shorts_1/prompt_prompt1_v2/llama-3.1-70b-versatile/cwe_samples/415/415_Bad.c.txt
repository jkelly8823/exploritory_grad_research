VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use-After-Free vulnerability potential, due to double-free on same memory location.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, it appears that the pointer `ptr` is freed twice. The first free operation occurs when `abrt` is true, and the second free operation occurs later in the code. This leads to undefined behavior as per the C standard because it attempts to free the same memory block twice. If an attacker has influenced the `abrt` variable, this double-free may be exploited.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this issue, you should check whether the memory has already been freed before calling `free(ptr)` again. Here's a simple fix:
```c
free(ptr);
ptr = NULL;
```
After freeing the memory, set `ptr` to `NULL`. Then, before calling `free(ptr)` again, check if `ptr` is not `NULL`:
```c
if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
}
```
This check prevents double-free and potential exploitation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
}
...
free(ptr);
```
