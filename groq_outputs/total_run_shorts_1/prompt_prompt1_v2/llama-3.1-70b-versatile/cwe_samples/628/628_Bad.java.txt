VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Authentication Bypass Vulnerability through Inconsistent Method Signature

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains two methods named `accessGranted`, but with inconsistent method signatures. The first method is declared to return `true` or `boolean` but is defined as `public boolean void accessGranted`. The keyword `void` is not required here and can cause a compiler error. Nevertheless, a more critical issue arises because the method with two parameters is not called directly. Instead, the method with three parameters is attempting to call itself with two parameters and `ADMIN_ROLES`. 

However, the return type of the first `accessGranted` method is inconsistent with the calling it recursively with a different set of parameters, `ADMIN_ROLES`. This can lead to inconsistent security checks and could bypass authentication for users with the `ADMIN_ROLES`. This could happen because the recursive call uses `ADMIN_ROLES`, potentially overwriting the security checks made with the actual user roles.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Remove the unnecessary `void` from the first method declaration and confirm it is declared to return `boolean`.
- Correctly call the second `accessGranted` method in the first one without changing user roles.
- Ensure consistent security checks and type signatures between these method calls.

ORIGINAL CODE:
private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...;public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user) {String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user);return accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES);}
                  private boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {
      
                           // grant or deny access based on user roles
                           ...
                     }
