VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The printFile function is vulnerable to file inclusion and file traversal vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The function uses the file_get_contents() function to read a file without properly validating the input. This can allow an attacker to access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope. Additionally, the function concatenates the $filename variable directly into the system, which can lead to a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. If an attacker can control the $filename variable, they may be able to access arbitrary files on the system.

The isOwnerOf() function appears to be a security control, but its effectiveness depends on the implementation of this function, which is not shown here. However, the use of file_get_contents() with untrusted input still poses a security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following:

1. Use a whitelist approach for file access: Instead of using a dynamic file path, use a whitelist of allowed files that can be accessed.
2. Validate and sanitize the input: Ensure that the $filename variable is validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks. Consider using functions like realpath() and basename() to normalize the file path.
3. Use a secure way to read files: Instead of using file_get_contents(), use functions like readfile() or require() that are safe for reading and including files.
4. Implement additional security controls: If the isOwnerOf() function is not effective in preventing unauthorized access, consider implementing additional security controls, such as proper access control and secure file handling.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
```
