VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Semicolon Usage

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises from the improper use of semicolons to separate statements. In the provided code snippet, when 'condition' is true, the function Do_X() will be executed, but due to the lack of a semicolon, Do_Y() will also be executed regardless of the condition. This could potentially lead to an unintended behavior or actions that were not intended by the program's author.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
We recommend adding a semicolon after the function call Do_X() to ensure that Do_Y() is only executed after the conditional statement is handled. Alternatively, we suggest using a conditional block instead of a single-lined condition to avoid this confusion and improve clarity in the code.

EXAMPLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
```c
if (condition == true) {
    Do_X();
}
Do_Y();
```
or
```
if (condition == true) Do_X(); 
Do_Y();
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
