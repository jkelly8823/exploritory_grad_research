VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Logging of Sensitive Information Vulnerability in Exception Handling

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential logging of sensitive information vulnerability. When catching an ApplicationSpecificException, the code logs the exception's string representation. This can potentially leak sensitive information if the exception contains confidential data. 

In many cases, exceptions can contain sensitive information such as database connection strings, file paths, or other confidential data. Logging such sensitive information can create a security risk, especially if the log output is not properly secured.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider logging a generic error message instead of the exception's string representation. You can include relevant information that does not compromise security. Additionally, ensure that the log output is properly secured and only accessible to authorized personnel. Consider using a logger that supports parameterized logging to prevent inclusion of sensitive data in log messages.

```
// Example of secure logging
logger.error("ApplicationSpecificException caught. See error ID for more information.");

// If required to log exception information, consider using an error ID
logger.error("ApplicationSpecificException caught. Error ID: {}", getErrorID());
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());}}
