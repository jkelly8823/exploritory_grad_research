VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a Broken Authentication vulnerability due to a lack of input validation and sanitization on the user's credentials, potentially allowing for authentication bypass attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not appear to perform any input validation or sanitization on the $user and $pass variables, which are automatically set from a POST request. This lack of validation and sanitization can make the application vulnerable to authentication bypass attacks, such as SQL injection attacks if the data is used directly in a database query. 

Additionally, the code uses a vulnerable function "login_user()" without checking the return type, and it is assumed that the function returns a boolean value which may or may not be correct. It's also important to note that the snippet does not include error handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement input validation and sanitization on the $user and $pass variables to prevent malicious input.
2. Use prepared statements with parameters when interacting with the database to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. Use a secure password hashing algorithm and store hashed passwords in the database instead of storing plain text passwords.
4. Check the return type of the "login_user()" function and handle any potential errors.
5. Implement proper error handling to handle unexpected situations.
6. Restrict the privileges of the database user and limit the amount of data exposed in the case of a successful authentication bypass.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                    // $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
                    if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
                    ...
                    
                  if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
