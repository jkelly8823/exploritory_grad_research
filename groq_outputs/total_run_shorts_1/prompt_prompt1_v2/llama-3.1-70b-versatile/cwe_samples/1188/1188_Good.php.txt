VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses user input from the POST request (`$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']`) without sanitizing or validating it. This can potentially lead to an attacker injecting malicious SQL code, compromising the database and gaining unauthorized access. We assume the `login_user` function interacts with a database, but without its definition, we cannot be certain. However, given the function's name and the context, it is a reasonable assumption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent SQL injection attacks, consider the following recommendations:

1.  Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to separate code from user input. This approach ensures that user input is treated as data only, preventing the execution of malicious SQL code.

2.  Validate and sanitize user input using PHP functions like `filter_var()` or `htmlspecialchars()` to remove any special characters that could be used in an SQL injection attack.

3.  Hash passwords before storing them in the database, and store the hashed password instead of the plaintext password. This way, even if an attacker gains access to the database, they will not be able to obtain the plaintext passwords.

EXAMPLE:

```php
// Validate user input
$filteredUser = filter_var($_POST['user'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
$filteredPass = filter_var($_POST['pass'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);

// Use prepared statements (example with PDO)
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password');
$stmt->bindParam(':username', $filteredUser);
$stmt->bindParam(':password', $filteredPass);
$stmt->execute();
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$user = $_POST['user'];$pass = $_POST['pass'];$authorized = false;if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
```
