VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Authentication Bypass and Information Disclosure Vulernability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an authentication bypass vulnerability. This is because when the "debug" POST parameter is set to "true", the $debugEnabled variable is set to true. This allows an attacker to bypass the standard authentication mechanism by simply adding a POST parameter to the request.

Furthermore, the code is also vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability. This is because when the $debugEnabled variable is true, the code calls the phpinfo() function, which displays a significant amount of information about the PHP configuration, including potentially sensitive information such as the operating system, PHP version, and loaded modules.

The vulnerability is present in the lines 3 and 4-6 of the code snippet. The issue arises from the insecure handling of the "debug" POST parameter, and the subsequent elevation of the user's privileges to an administrative level.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the vulnerability, it is recommended to remove the debug code that allows for authentication bypass and information disclosure. Additionally, access control mechanisms should be implemented to prevent attackers from abusing the system.

In particular:

- Remove the code that sets the $debugEnabled variable based on the "debug" POST parameter.
- Remove the call to phpinfo() and any other code that discloses sensitive information.
- Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the system.
- Ensure that user authentication is properly validated and sanitized before granting access to the system.

ORIGINAL CODE:

$debugEnabled = false;if ($_POST["debug"] == "true"){$debugEnabled = true;}
.../
function login($username, $password){if($debugEnabled){echo 'Debug Activated';phpinfo();$isAdmin = True;return True;}}
