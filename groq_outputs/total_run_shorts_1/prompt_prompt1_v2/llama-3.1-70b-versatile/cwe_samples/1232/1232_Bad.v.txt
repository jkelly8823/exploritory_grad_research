VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper Access Control due to Incomplete Reset

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses an always block to execute on the rising edge of the clock signal. Inside the block, it checks if three conditions (`rst_ni`, `jtag_unlock`, and `rst_9`) are not all set to true. If this condition is met, it iterates over a 6-element array `reglk_mem` and sets each element to zero.

However, this code may represent a vulnerability because the conditions checked do not cover all reset scenarios. If the three conditions are not all set to true, the reset logic will not be executed, potentially leaving the `reglk_mem` array in an uninitialized or tainted state. This could lead to unintended behavior in the rest of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that all possible reset scenarios are properly handled. Consider adding additional checks or removing redundant conditions from the if-statement. For example:

- Remove the condition `!rst_ni` if it is supposed to be asserted during reset, or
- Replace the `~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock && ~rst_9)` with a more comprehensive reset condition.

Additionally, consider using a single recognized reset signal instead of multiple signals, to simplify the reset logic and prevent this type of vulnerability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
module reglk_wrapper #(
...
  
  always @(posedge clk_i)
  
    begin
    
      if(~(rst_ni && ~jtag_unlock && ~rst_9))
      
        begin
        
          for (j=0; j < 6; j=j+1) begin
        
            reglk_mem[j] <= 'h0;
        
          end
        
        end
      
      ...
    
```
