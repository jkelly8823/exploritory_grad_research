VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Insecure Hardcoded Data Exposure
EXPLANATION:
The code prints out hardcoded data in response to a user action, specifically when the source of the ActionEvent is equal to the 'button' variable. This could potentially expose sensitive or confidential information if the printed data includes secrets or credentials.

Although there is no clear indication that the data is actually sensitive in this code snippet, we should always be cautious and consider potential exposure risks. It is essential to note that hardcoding sensitive data in this manner can make it easily accessible in code reviews or if the source code is obtained by unauthorized parties.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
If the data printed is not sensitive information and is intended for debugging or logging purposes, consider replacing the hardcoded value with a placebo or random data. It is recommended to avoid printing such data directly in the source code and instead store it securely, or log it through a secure means, such as an application logging framework.

To secure sensitive data exposure in this manner:
- Remove hardcoded sensitive information.
- Replace printing with a logging framework that provides secure logging options.
- Use secure data storage for sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    if (e.getSource() == button) {
        System.out.println("print out secret information");
    }
}
```
