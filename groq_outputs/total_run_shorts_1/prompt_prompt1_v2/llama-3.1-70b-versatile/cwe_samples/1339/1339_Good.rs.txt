VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11, 13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
In the `rec_big` function, the `rec_big` function calls itself indirectly through the `big_calc` function. This could lead to a potential stack overflow if `turns` is a large number. Additionally, there's a division operation in the `rec_big` function, which could lead to a division by zero vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, there are two potential issues: possible stack overflow due to deep recursive calls and potential division by zero error. The `big_calc` function iterates from `2` to `turns + 1` and for each iteration, it calls `rec_big` which in turn performs divisions. If `z` or `y` becomes zero during any iteration, it would result in a division by zero error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To prevent stack overflow, consider using iterative methods instead of recursive ones.
2. To prevent division by zero errors:
- Validate inputs before passing them to the `rec_big` function.
- Add checks to handle potential division by zero.
- Consider using a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur during division.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
Use num_rational::BigRational;
                      
fn rec_big(y: BigRational, z: BigRational) -> BigRational
{
    BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(108))
    - ((BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(815))
    - BigRational::from_integer(BigInt::from(1500)) / z)
    / y)
}
      
fn big_calc(turns: usize) -> BigRational 
{
    let mut x: Vec<BigRational> = vec![BigRational::from_float(4.0).unwrap(), BigRational::from_float(4.25).unwrap(),];
    
    (2..turns + 1).for_each(|number| 
    {
        x.push(rec_big(x[number - 1].clone(), x[number - 2].clone()));
    });
    x[turns].clone()
}
