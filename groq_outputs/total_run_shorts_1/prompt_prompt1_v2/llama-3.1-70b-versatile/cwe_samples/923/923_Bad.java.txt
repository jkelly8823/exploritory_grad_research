VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an Insecure Data Storage and Implicit Intent Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code is insecure in multiple ways. Firstly, the usage of a Broadcast Receiver (BroadcastReceiver) can potentially leak sensitive information through the intent which is not suitable for secure data exchange. Broadcasting sensitive information can allow malicious apps to intercept and exploit it. Furthermore, using an implicit intent ('com.example.RemoveUser') instead of an explicit one makes the app more vulnerable as the intent can be intercepted by any app on the system.

Secondly, within the DeleteReceiver class, user data is destroyed directly in the BroadcastReceiver. In terms of security, BroadcastReceivers should not handle sensitive operations such as destroying user data.

Finally, the intent's extras bundle is not validated before accessing its contents. This makes the code prone to exceptions if the 'userID' extra is missing or is not an integer.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Replace Broadcasting with other secure methods for inter-process communication like startActivityForResult, bound services, or direct method calls (if possible).
2. If Broadcasting is unavoidable, use explicit intents by specifying the exact class or package name that should receive the intent.
3. Validate the intent's extras bundle before accessing its contents to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions or ClassCastExceptions.
4. Avoid handling sensitive data or operations within a BroadcastReceiver. Use a Service or other secured operations instead.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
registerReceiver(receiver, filter);

public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver{
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
        destroyUserData(userID);
    }
}
```
