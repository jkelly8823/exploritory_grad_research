VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Use of insecure MessageDigest instance and use of MessageDigest object belonging to a different variable.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be an attempt at hashing and verifying a password. However, it contains several vulnerabilities. 
The primary issue here is with the following two lines:
1. byte\[\] digest = password.digest(); - This line indicates that 'password' is being used for generating the hash, however, the instance being updated earlier in the code ('encer') is supposed to be the hashing object.
2. The instance 'encer' which was correctly being used to create a hash, is not being utilized to retrieve the digest.

Moreover, this code snippet is further complicated with extremely insecure practices:
1. Missing or assumed implementation of the `equal` and `secret_password` functions are assumed secure (no validation). 
2. A hardcoded hash comparison might seem acceptable but as described above there seems to be a mismatch with respect to usage of variables.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of directly storing and comparing a hash value, you should use a secure password hashing and verification mechanism. Preferably, consider using a dedicated library for password hashing.

Here are some key points to improve the code:
- Correct the usage of variables in the code; most likely `encer.digest()` should be used instead of `password.digest()`.
- Implement secure `equal` function. Preferably, you can use `MessageDigest.isEqual()` for safe comparison.
- Implement secure storage and comparison of secrets (`secret_password()`).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn); 
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA"); 
encer.update(plainTextIn); 
byte[] digest = password.digest(); 
// Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest, secret_password())) { login_user(); }
```
