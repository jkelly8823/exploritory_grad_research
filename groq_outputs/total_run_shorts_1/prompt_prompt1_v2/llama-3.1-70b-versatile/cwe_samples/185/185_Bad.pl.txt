VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
This code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The `system` function in Perl executes a command in the operating system. The `$phone` variable, which is derived from the `GetPhoneNumber` function, is directly passed to the `system` function. An attacker who has control over the input could inject malicious commands that could compromise the system. 

In this case, the regular expression `/\.+-\d+/` only checks if the number contains hyphens and digits, which is not sufficient to prevent command injection attacks. An attacker could inject special characters that are interpreted by the shell.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Consider using a safer function for executing shell commands, such as `perl`'s `exec` function or a library that provides safer alternatives for interacting with the shell.
2. Implement proper input validation and sanitize the input to prevent special characters that could be interpreted by the shell.
3. If possible, avoid using `system` function altogether and instead use a phone lookup library that provides a safer interface.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$phone = GetPhoneNumber();if ($phone =~ /\d+-\d+/) {
                        # looks like it only has hyphens and digits
                        system("lookup-phone $phone");}
               else {error("malformed number!");}
