VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability found is a potential Resource Leak. The FileInputStream object, fis, is not guaranteed to be closed in case of an exception.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, a FileInputStream object is opened inside a loop. If an exception occurs while reading from the file or processing it, the FileInputStream will not be closed. This can lead to a resource leak, where the file remains open even after the application has finished using it.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using a try-with-resources statement, which automatically closes the FileInputStream, even if an exception occurs. Here's how you can modify the code:

```java
for (Iterator i=users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
    String userName = (String) i.next();
    String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + "/" + userName;
    
    try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName)) {
        fis.read(byteArray);
        processPFile(userName, byteArray);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
FileInputStream fis;byte[] byteArray = new byte[1024];for (Iterator i=users.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
    String userName = (String) i.next();String pFileName = PFILE_ROOT + "/" + userName;FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(pFileName);fis.read(byteArray); // the file is always 1k bytesfis.close();processPFile(userName, byteArray);
```

Note that in the recommended fix, I've assumed that processPFile will handle any exceptions that may occur. If that's not the case, you should handle the exception properly, possibly by logging it and/or propagating it further.
