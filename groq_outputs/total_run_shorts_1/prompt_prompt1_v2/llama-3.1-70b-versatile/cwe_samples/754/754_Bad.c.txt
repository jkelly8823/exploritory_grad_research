VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow_via unbounded strcpy

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The `fgets` function is used to read a string from the standard input into the `buf` array, which has a size of 10 characters. However, there is no null-terminator added to the string when it reaches the end of the buffer.

Then the `strcpy` function is used to copy the string from `buf` to `cp_buf`, which also has a size of 10 characters. However, `strcpy` does not perform any bounds checking and will continue to copy characters until it encounters a null-terminator in the source string.

If the input to `fgets` is longer than 9 characters (leaving one character for the null-terminator), the `strcpy` function will overflow the `cp_buf` array and potentially overwrite adjacent memory locations with user-controlled data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a safer string-copying function such as `strncpy` (along with a check to ensure null-termination) or `strcpy_s`, and always ensure to check the return value of functions like `fgets` to handle errors properly. Consider using a safer input method such as `fgets_s` or `gets_s` if available.

It is also recommended to increase the buffer size or add input validation to prevent the buffer overflow. Consider using a language that is not susceptible to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, such as a language that uses garbage collection or bounds checking.

Here is an example of how the `strcpy` line can be safely modified:

  strncpy(cp_buf, buf, sizeof(cp_buf) - 1);
  cp_buf[sizeof(cp_buf) - 1] = '\0';

ORIGINAL CODE:
char buf[10], cp_buf[10];fgets(buf, 10, stdin);strcpy(cp_buf, buf);
