VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The `setInputFile` method allows the user to specify a file path using the `inputFile` parameter. However, the code does not perform any validation or sanitization on this input. This could potentially lead to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to access sensitive files on the system.

Additionally, the `setInputFile` method is not assigned any code to create a `readFile` object which could indicate that the actual file path construction may happen elsewhere in the code. Still, given the lack of visible validation it's a potential security concern.

In the `readFromFile` method, the `reader` object is created with the `readFile` object which may have been set using user-controlled input in `setInputFile`. This could allow an attacker to control the file that is being read.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input file path in the `setInputFile` method to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. Ensure that the file path is canonicalized before using it to create a `readFile` object.
3. Implement a whitelist of allowed file paths to prevent access to sensitive files.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
 private File readFile = null;
 public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
       
    // create readFile File object from string containing name of file

 }
 public void readFromFile() {
    try {
        reader = new FileReader(readFile);
        // read input file
          
      } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}
 }
```
