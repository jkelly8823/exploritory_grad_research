VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code appears to be checking the operating system name and then printing a message if the system is "Windows 95". However, the code uses `System.clearProperty("os.name")` which can cause issues, but more importantly, the vulnerability here is a potential Information Disclosure Vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION:
If an attacker were able to inject or manipulate the operating system name, the application could potentially reveal information about its internal state or behavior. However the main issue here appears to be the inconsistent use of System.clearProperty("os.name") followed by an immediate System.getProperty("os.name") call. This is effectively doing nothing and getting the original os name.
 
Even though the code isn't in use to make any significant security decisions directly, any potentially sensitive information about the system that could be gained by an attacker should be mitigated. 

A bigger issue is also that this could potentially allow for certain kinds of Denial of Service or Exploit. If system clears property is continually set off, it could also potentially result in multiple error and invalid responses because critical functionality is trying to use this to make decisions which could result into critical impacts or downtime.



RECOMMENDATIONS:
An immediate call of System.getProperty("os.name") must follow no call to System.clearProperty("os.name"). It would likely still be better not to reveal any sensitive information at all; therefore you should fix it such that no information about your operating system or if indeed running under windows or any other such os could be gained by manipulation of system clear and retrieval, in order to do that you'd not use the code which effectively makes no sense in the snippet that's provided and instead would go about testing for such conditions "internal". Another option would be to use the Java SE 7 FileStore and Path WatchService, if this would meet the needs of your application, and remove these calls in accordance. Also consider to refactor the code to prevent potential NPE. We also recommend to only reveal necessary information that can be safely revealed, and nothing else.



ORIGINAL CODE:
                  System.clearProperty("os.name");...String os = System.getProperty("os.name");if (os.equalsIgnoreCase("Windows 95")) System.out.println("Not supported");
