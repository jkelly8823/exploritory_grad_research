VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Sensitive data storage - insecure storage of personally identifiable information (PII) in clear text.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals sensitive data, specifically `accountOwnerSSN` and `accountOwnerName`, being stored as plain text within the `BankAccount` class. This data should be encrypted for security reasons to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information in case of a potential data breach.

Additionally, passing sensitive data such as SSN directly to the constructor could potentially expose it.

Furthermore, use of SSN in clear text raises serious security concerns and must be avoided.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Store sensitive data in an encrypted format. Consider using secure encryption algorithms and storing the encrypted values. If accessing sensitive data, restrict access to a minimum required and apply additional verification of user rights.

Use a secure way to handle and transmit sensitive data such as password hashing algorithms.

Consider rewriting the constructor to not pass sensitive data and instead leave that action to be performed under secure services using secure protocols such as HTTPS.
Replace hard coded timer time period with some config if possible to add an additional layer of security and auditability. 

Apply password masking if used in any transaction to add an additional layer of security. Also implement different roles for system administrators and customers/users to restrict access to certain sensitive actions/actions related to accounts.
Limit access with least privilege access.
