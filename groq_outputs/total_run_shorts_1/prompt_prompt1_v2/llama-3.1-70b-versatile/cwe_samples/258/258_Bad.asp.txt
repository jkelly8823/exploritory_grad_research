VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Clear-text database credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains database connection strings that have clear-text credentials. Although a password is present, it is empty, suggesting that authentication may be available in a different manner, or account details are being maintained elsewhere. In most real-world applications, having clear-text database credentials, whether empty or not, can be considered a security vulnerability. It is the job of the user to manage them securely.

However, given the empty password, there isn't enough information to classify this as an immediate vulnerability in this instance. In real-world deployment scenarios, password and credential files are frequently managed outside the code itself and referenced by connection strings.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Storing passwords or credentials as part of database connection strings is inadvisable. Environment variables or files such as .env that are managed and locked at the operating system level should contain credentials, reducing any hardcoded credentials inside code itself.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
