VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet reveals hardcoded sensitive credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The most severe vulnerability in this code snippet is the presence of hardcoded sensitive credentials, specifically a username and a password. This is problematic because an attacker who gains access to this code will obtain the sensitive credentials. Furthermore, hardcoded credentials pose a significant risk if the code repository is compromised or accessed by unauthorized parties.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive credentials, such as usernames and passwords, as environment variables, and then reference these variables in your code. This allows you to separate the sensitive data from the codebase.

2. **Implement a secrets management system**: Use a secrets management tool, such as HashiCorp's Vault, to securely store and manage sensitive credentials. This system will ensure that sensitive data is properly encrypted and protected.

3. **Use configuration files**: Store sensitive credentials in a configuration file that is not committed to the code repository. Use this file to load the sensitive credentials into memory.

4. **Use an authentication proxy**: Implement an authentication proxy or an authentication service that abstracts the authentication logic from your main application code. This approach will ensure that your sensitive credentials are not hardcoded in your main codebase.

5. **Least privilege principle**: Limit the access to sensitive credentials by following the principle of least privilege, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to the components that require it to function correctly.
