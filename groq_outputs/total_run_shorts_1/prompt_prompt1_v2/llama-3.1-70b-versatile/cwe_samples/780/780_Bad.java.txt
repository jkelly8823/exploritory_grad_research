VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure error handling and exception masking.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet has two main issues. The error handling in the `getRSACipher` method catches exceptions that are then simply logged with a message stating that they should never happen. This is misleading and could potentially hide real issues. If an exception occurs, the method will continue to return `null`, which is not properly handled. Furthermore, the method returns `null` when an exception occurs, which is not clearly indicated to the caller.

The `RSA/NONE/NoPadding` encryption padding scheme is also used. While RSA is a secure encryption algorithm, the use of `NoPadding` makes the encryption vulnerable to Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) and Bleichenbacher attacks (also known as Million Message Attack). Vulnerable RSA encryption with no padding can be exploited if an attacker controls the ciphertexts being decrypted.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove the unnecessary try-catch blocks and allow the exceptions to propagate, so they can be properly handled by the caller.
2. Implement secure RSA encryption padding, such as OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) or PKCS#1 version 2 padding.
3. Return an Optional or a defaultValue when an exception occurs.

4. Preferably handle an exception in the caller method instead of returning `null` from this method. A caller can then decide whether to try to recover, communicate an error message to the user, or propagate the exception further.

5. Do consider using more modern algorithms and techniques that offer both encryption and authentication.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public Cipher getRSACipher() {
    Cipher rsa = null;
    try {
        rsa = javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance("RSA/NONE/NoPadding");
    } catch (java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        log("this should never happen", e);
    } catch (javax.crypto.NoSuchPaddingException e) {
        log("this should never happen", e);
    }
    return rsa;
}
```
