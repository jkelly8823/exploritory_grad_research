VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Double-free vulnerability and use-after-free vulnerability. 

EXPLANATION: 
The given code presents two critical vulnerabilities. Firstly, a double-free vulnerability may occur when 'err' is true and 'abrt' is also true. In this scenario, the 'ptr' is freed but still logged as an error, potentially leading to a double-free if that same pointer is later attempted to be freed or a use-after-free vulnerability if it is accessed again.
 
Additionally, if free(ptr) is called in the beginning and 'abrt' is true later, the program will attempt to log an error with a pointer (ptr) that has already been freed, as the value is still stored in 'ptr', resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these vulnerabilities, we can modify the given code snippet as follows:

1. Move 'logError' before 'free(ptr)' and set 'ptr' to NULL after 'free(ptr)' to avoid potential double-free or use-after-free situations:
  ```c
if (err) {
    if (abrt) {
        logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
    }
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
}
...
if (abrt) {
    // Ensure we are not accessing 'ptr' here if it has already been freed
    if (ptr != NULL) {
        logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);
    } else {
        logError("operation aborted before commit, cannot log ptr as it has been freed.");
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);if (err) {abrt = 1;free(ptr);}...if (abrt) {logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);}
