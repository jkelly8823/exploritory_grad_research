VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: All code lines
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a double-free issue. The pointer `ptr` is freed twice if the condition `abrt` is true. 

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory and stores the address in the pointer `ptr`. Later, if the condition `abrt` is true, the code frees the memory pointed by `ptr`. However, regardless of the condition, the code again frees the same pointer `ptr` after the conditional block. This is a double-free vulnerability, which can cause unpredictable behavior and potentially lead to a segmentation fault or other issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the memory pointed by `ptr` is freed only once. You can achieve this by adding an additional check before freeing the memory for the second time to ensure it has not been already freed. Here's a possible fix:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);

// Other operations...

if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // Set ptr to NULL to indicate that it's already freed
}

// Ensure ptr is not NULL before freeing
if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL; // Set ptr to NULL for good practice
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}...free(ptr);
```
