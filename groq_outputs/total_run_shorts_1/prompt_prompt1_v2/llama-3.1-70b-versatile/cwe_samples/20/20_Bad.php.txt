VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks due to the direct reflection of unsanitized user input from GET requests into the HTML output.

EXPLANATION:
The code directly echoes unsanitized user input received through GET requests without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the input by injecting malicious JavaScript code. When an unsuspecting victim visits the webpage, this code would execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or conduct other malicious activities.

In line 1, both $birthday and $homepage are directly echoed into the HTML output without any sanitization. The $homepage variable is particularly concerning as it is used in an HTML anchor tag, allowing an attacker to inject malicious URLs or JavaScript code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent XSS attacks, proper sanitation and validation of user input should be implemented. 

1. Sanitize the $birthday variable using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent any malicious code injection.

2. Validate and sanitize the $homepage variable to ensure it is a valid URL. This can be done using `filter_var()` and checking the scheme (e.g., `http` or `https`). Never
