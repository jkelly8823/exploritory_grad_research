VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated URL Redirect Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the `UrlHandlerReceiver` class, specifically in the `onReceive` method. When an intent with the action "com.example.URLHandler.openURL" is received, the code extracts a URL from the intent and proceeds with it without validating whether the URL is trustworthy or not. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to redirect the victim to a malicious URL.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the received URL should be validated before being used. It's necessary to check the scheme, host, and other parameters of the URL to ensure that it's not malicious. Here are some steps to validate the URL:

1. Check the scheme: Ensure that the scheme is HTTP or HTTPS to prevent an attacker from redirecting to a file based or other type of malicious URL.
2. Whitelist the domains: Validate the domain by whitelisting the accepted domains to prevent an attacker from redirecting to an arbitrary domain.
3. Decode and normalize the URL: URL decoding and normalization can help prevent an attacker from bypassing the above checks.

Here's an example of how the above recommendations can be implemented:

```java
if("com.example.URLHandler.openURL".equals(intent.getAction())) {
    String URL = intent.getStringExtra("URLToOpen");
    Uri parsedUri = Uri.parse(URL);
    if ("http".equals(parsedUri.getScheme()) || "https".equals(parsedUri.getScheme())) {
        if (Arrays.asList("trusted-domain.com").contains(parsedUri.getHost())) {
            // Process the URL as it's trusted.
        } else {
            // Reject the URL if the domain is not trusted.
        }
    } else {
        // Reject the URL if the scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS.
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


                     ...
                     IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.URLHandler.openURL");MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();registerReceiver(receiver, filter);
                     ...
                     
                     public class UrlHandlerReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
                        @Overridepublic void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
                              if("com.example.URLHandler.openURL".equals(intent.getAction())) {String URL = intent.getStringExtra("URLToOpen");int length = URL.length();
                                 
                                 ...
                                 }
                           }
                     }
