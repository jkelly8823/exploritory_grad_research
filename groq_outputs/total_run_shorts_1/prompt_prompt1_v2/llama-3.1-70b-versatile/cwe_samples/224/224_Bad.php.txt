VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The function `readFile` takes a `$filename` as input and uses it to read the contents of a file without properly sanitizing the input. Specifically, on line 4, the code uses the `readlink` function to resolve the file if it's a symbolic link. However, this does not prevent an attacker from providing a filename that traverses the directory structure and accesses sensitive files. The code also uses the `file_get_contents` function to read the file contents, which can be exploited by an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

Furthermore, the code does not validate the `$filename` input to ensure it is a valid file path and does not contain any malicious characters. This lack of input validation, combined with the use of `readlink` and `file_get_contents`, makes the code vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Validate the input `$filename` using a whitelisting approach to ensure it is a valid file path within the intended directory.
2. Use the `basename` function to ensure the filename does not contain any directory traversal characters.
3. Use the `realpath` function to normalize the file path and prevent path traversal attacks.
4. Use a directory-based approach to read files, instead of using the `file_get_contents` function.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();$realFile = $filename;
       
       //resolve file if its a symbolic link
       if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
       if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
    }
```
