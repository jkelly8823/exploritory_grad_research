VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a Command Injection vulnerability. The code snippet contains a hardcoded az command with user-input variables <storage-account> and <resource-group>.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet executes an az command with the storage account name and resource group as input. If either of these input variables are not properly sanitized, an attacker may inject malicious commands. Although the intention is to update the storage account settings, an attacker may manipulate the command by providing specially crafted input for the account name or resource group. This could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the input variables <storage-account> and <resource-group> are properly sanitized and validated. It's recommended to use prepared statements or parameterized queries when executing system commands. Additionally, validate the input data against a list of acceptable values. Do not blindly trust user-input data.

Consider using the Azure SDK or client libraries instead of executing shell commands to reduce the risk of command injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false
