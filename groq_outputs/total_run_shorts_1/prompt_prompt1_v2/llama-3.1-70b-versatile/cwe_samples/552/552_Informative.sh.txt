VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Hardcoded Sensitive Information and Command Injection vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses a hardcoded bucket name 'BUCKET_NAME' directly in a gsutil command. This can be vulnerable to two potential issues. Firstly, it is unclear whether 'BUCKET_NAME' is a variable or a hardcoded value. If it is a variable, and it's not validated or sanitized, it could be vulnerable to command injection if an attacker can manipulate its value. If 'BUCKET_NAME' is a hardcoded value, this is an example of hardcoded sensitive information, which is a bad practice for security reasons. This can allow unauthorized access to sensitive resources or cause unintended behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. If 'BUCKET_NAME' is a variable, validate and sanitize its value before using it in the gsutil command to prevent command injection attacks.
2. If 'BUCKET_NAME' is a hardcoded value, replace it with an environment variable or a secure configuration store.

ORIGINAL CODE:


               gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME
