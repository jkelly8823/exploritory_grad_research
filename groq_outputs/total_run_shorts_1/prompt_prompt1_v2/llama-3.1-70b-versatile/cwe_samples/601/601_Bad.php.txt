VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Redirect Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an unvalidated redirect attack. The `$redirect_url` variable is directly obtained from the `$_GET['url']` parameter, which is a user-supplied input, and is then used to redirect the user to the specified location without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the redirect URL, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the redirect URL should be validated and sanitized to ensure it points to a legitimate location within the application. Here are some recommended fixes:

1.  Whitelisting: Only allow redirects to a set of pre-defined, trusted URLs.
2.  URL Validation: Validate the redirect URL to ensure it conforms to expected formats and contains no malicious characters.
3.  Token-based validation: Use a token-based validation mechanism to verify the redirect request.

Example of a validated redirect:

```php
// Get the redirect URL
$redirect_url = $_GET['url'];

// Define a list of allowed redirect URLs
$allowed_redirects = array('https://example.com/login', 'https://example.com/register');

// Check if the redirect URL is in the allowed list
if (in_array($redirect_url, $allowed_redirects)) {
    // If allowed, perform the redirect
    header("Location: " . $redirect_url);
} else {
    // If not allowed, display an error message
    echo "Invalid redirect URL.";
    exit;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$redirect_url = $_GET['url'];
header("Location: " . $redirect_url);
```
