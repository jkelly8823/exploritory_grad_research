VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (HTML and JavaScript are mixed; however, there is a potential vulnerability in the JavaScript file from an external domain.)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or unauthorized data access via untrusted third-party JavaScript.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a JavaScript file from an external domain called "externalDomain.example.com/weatherwidget.js". This line poses a security risk since it loads code from an external source. A malicious actor who controls this external domain could inject malicious JavaScript, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or unauthorized data access. 

Additionally, if the login credentials are transmitted in plaintext or if there are any fields that allow for user input that are not being validated correctly, this increases the risk of an XSS attack or other malicious activities.

Since we don't have the JavaScript code for review and cannot analyze the entire functionality of the login form, I can only focus on what is presented, which means I will only point out a potential vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Only embed JavaScript files from trusted domains, or host them on your own server.
2. Ensure there are proper Content-Security-Policy (CSP) settings configured on your web application, and make sure users are being validated and their inputs are being sanitized for use within any server-side scripting languages that may be being used elsewhere.
3. Use HTTPS for transmission of sensitive information (credentials).
4. Implement secure data handling, validation, and sanitization practices for any user-provided input.
