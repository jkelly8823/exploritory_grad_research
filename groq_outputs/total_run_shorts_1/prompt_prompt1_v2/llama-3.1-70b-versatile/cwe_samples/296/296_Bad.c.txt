VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Certificate Verification Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet evaluates the result of a certificate verification process using the OpenSSL library. However, it only checks for two specific error codes (X509_V_OK and X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN) and deems the certificate valid if either of these conditions are met. 

X509_V_OK indicates that the certificate chain was successfully verified, and X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN indicates that a self-signed certificate is present in the chain. However, the code snippet does not check for other possible error codes that may indicate security issues with the certificate. 

This can lead to insecure certificate verification, where a certificate with untrusted or revoked status is considered valid, allowing a potential man-in-the-middle attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, you should check all possible error codes returned by the SSL_get_verify_result function. The following list includes a non-exhaustive collection of potential error codes to check:

- X509_V_OK: The certificate was successfully verified.
- X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE: Couldn't verify leaf signature.
- X509_V_ERR_CERT_CHAIN_TOO_LONG: Certificate chain too long error.
- X509_V_ERR_CERT_REVOKED: Certificate revoked error.
- X509_V_ERR_INVALID_PURPOSE: Certificate invalid for specified use error.
- X509_V_ERR_INVALID_CA: Certificate invalid for specified use error.

The following code snippet provides a basic example of how to check for these error codes:

```c
X509* cert;
int foo;

// Get the peer certificate
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host) {
    // Get the verify result
    foo = SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);

    if (X509_V_OK == foo) {
        // Certificate looks good, host can be trusted
    } else if (X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN == foo) {
        // Certificate is self-signed
    } else {
        // Handle other error codes
        switch (foo) {
            case X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE:
                break;
            case X509_V_ERR_CERT_CHAIN_TOO_LONG:
                break;
            case X509_V_ERR_CERT_REVOKED:
                break;
            case X509_V_ERR_INVALID_PURPOSE:
                break;
            case X509_V_ERR_INVALID_CA:
                break;
            // Handle other error codes...
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host)foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))
        
// certificate looks good, host can be trusted
