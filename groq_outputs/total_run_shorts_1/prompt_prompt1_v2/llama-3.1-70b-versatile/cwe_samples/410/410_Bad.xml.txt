VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials in configuration file.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains hardcoded credentials, including a username and password, for a MySQL database. Hardcoding credentials directly into configuration files or code poses a significant security risk, as anyone with access to the code can access the database. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who gains access to the code or configuration files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid hardcoding sensitive information such as database credentials. Instead, use environment variables or a secure configuration file that is not committed to version control. This way, even if an attacker gains access to the code, they will not be able to obtain the sensitive information.

Here's an example of how you can store database credentials in environment variables:

```xml
<Resource name="jdbc/exampledb" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource" removeAbandoned="true" removeAbandonedTimeout="30" maxActive="5" maxIdle="5" maxWait="60000" username="${DB_USERNAME}" password="${DB_PASSWORD}" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" url="${DB_URL}"/>
```

Then, set the environment variables in your operating system or containerization platform. This will prevent sensitive information from being exposed in the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<Resource name="jdbc/exampledb" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource" removeAbandoned="true" removeAbandonedTimeout="30" maxActive="5" maxIdle="5" maxWait="60000" username="testuser" password="testpass" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/exampledb"/>
