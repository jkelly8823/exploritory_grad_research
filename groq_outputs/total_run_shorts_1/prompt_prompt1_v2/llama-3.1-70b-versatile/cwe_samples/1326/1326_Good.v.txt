VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code contains a potential out-of-bounds array access vulnerability. In the line `assign rdata_o = (raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;`, it checks if `raddr_q` is less than `RomSize` before accessing `mem[raddr_q]`. However, it is possible that the size of the `mem` array is not equal to `RomSize`. If `RomSize` is larger than the actual size of the `mem` array, this could lead to an out-of-bounds access.

Additionally, the line `raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];` is using `addr_i` to generate the `raddr_q` which is used to access `mem`. However, it does not check if `addr_i` is valid or within the bounds of the `mem` array.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `RomSize` is not larger than the actual size of the `mem` array. Additionally, you should validate the `addr_i` value before using it to generate `raddr_q`. Consider adding checks to ensure that `addr_i` is within the valid range of the `mem` array.

It is also recommended to consider using bounds checking or address wrapping prevention techniques to prevent out-of-bounds accesses.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
...
always_ff @(posedge clk_i) begin
    if (req_i) begin
        raddr_q <= addr_i[$clog2(RomSize)-1+3:3];
    end
end
...
// this prevents spurious Xes from propagating into the speculative fetch stage of the core
assign rdata_o = (raddr_q < RomSize) ? mem[raddr_q] : '0;
...
```
