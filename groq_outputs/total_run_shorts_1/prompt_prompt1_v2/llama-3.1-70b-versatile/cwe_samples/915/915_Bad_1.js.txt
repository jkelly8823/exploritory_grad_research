VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Prototype Pollution vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `setValueByPath` function is used to set values on an object using a path. However, the path used in this code includes `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`, which are references to the object's prototype.

By setting a value on the prototype, an attacker can potentially pollute the prototype chain and manipulate the behavior of objects. In this case, the code is attempting to set a property `isAdmin` to `true` on the prototype, which could lead to unintended consequences.

The `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype` properties are used to access the prototype of an object. By setting a value on these properties, the code is essentially modifying the prototype chain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to avoid setting values on the prototype chain. Instead, the code should ensure that it is setting values on the intended object.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. Use a library that provides a safe way to set values on objects, such as `lodash` or `immutable`.
2. Use a `freeze` function to prevent the object's prototype from being modified.
3. Validate the input to ensure that it is not attempting to set values on the prototype chain.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
 setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
 setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
```
