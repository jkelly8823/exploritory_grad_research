Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code provided contains a path traversal vulnerability. Although the code attempts to sanitize the input by removing the '../' pattern, this approach is insufficient and can be bypassed. An attacker could provide an input like '..\/' or '%2e%2e%2f' (URL-encoded '../'), which would bypass the sanitization and potentially allow the code to access arbitrary files on the system. Furthermore, using untrusted input directly in the construction of the filename without proper validation and sanitization is insecure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should properly validate and sanitize the input. Here are a few suggestions:

- Use a whitelist approach to validate the username: ensure that it only contains allowed characters, such as alphanumeric characters.
- Use a more robust sanitization approach that takes into account various encoding schemes and file system variations.
- Avoid using untrusted input directly in the construction of the filename. Instead, use a canonicalized path that is derived from the input.
- Consider using a library or framework that provides secure file access and path manipulation functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:

my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
