VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses a regular expression with a repeated, capturing group (`(\w+\s?)*`) that can lead to catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the regular expression engine to freeze or enter an infinite loop when processing large input strings. This type of vulnerability can lead to denial of service attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we can replace the regular expression with a more efficient and safer alternative. We can use a possessive quantifier (e.g., `(\w+\s?)+` to `(?>
(w+ \s?)++))` using a possessive quantifier to fix this issue, but that will also alter the end result of the current match.

However, we can fix the issue by anchoring the \w+ so that the engine must consume every word character first. Here's an example of how you can do this using an atomic group.

```perl
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $bdrslt = $test_string;
$bdrslt =~ /^(?>\w+ \s?)+$/i;
```

However, this solution may still not work as expected since \w+ will still cause the engine to backtrack if it is not able to match the end of the string with $, resulting in extremely poor performance with certain classes of strings.

There is also another better solution, that will avoid any such type of issues:

```perl
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $bdrslt = $test_string;
$bdrslt =~ /^[\w\s]+$/i;
```
It will just simply allow for the engine to be able to read the string and do with it what the application requires with excellent speed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $bdrslt = $test_string;
$bdrslt =~ /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
```
