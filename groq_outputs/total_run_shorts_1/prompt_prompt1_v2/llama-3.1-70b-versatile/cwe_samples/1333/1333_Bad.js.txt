VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
RegexpDoS (ReDoS) Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression in line 2 is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. The pattern `(\w+\s?)*$` contains nested repetition operators and a conditional repetition operator (`\s?`) which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when faced with malicious input. This can cause the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop or take an excessively long time to complete, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the regular expression should be rewritten to avoid nested repetition operators. Here are a few possible solutions:

* Use a possessive quantifier (`\w++`) to prevent backtracking.
* Use a non-greedy quantifier (`\w+?`) to prevent excessive backtracking.
* Use a regex with anchored, non-possessive quantifiers.

Here's a revised version of the regex using the first approach:
```
var bad_pattern  = /^\w*$/i;
```
This version of the regex will still match any sequence of word characters, but it will do so in a way that is less vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
```
