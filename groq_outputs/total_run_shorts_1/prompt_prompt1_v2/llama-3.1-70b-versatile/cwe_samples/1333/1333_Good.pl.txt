VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack.

EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `/^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. The pattern contains nested repetitions and overlapping groups, which can cause the regex engine to take exponential time to process certain inputs, leading to a denial of service. This can happen if the input string contains certain combinations of characters that cause the regex engine to perform an excessive number of recursive calls.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you can rewrite the regular expression to avoid nested repetitions and overlapping groups. Here is a possible fix:

```
my $gdrslt = $test_string;
$gdrslt =~ /^\w+(?:\s+\w+)*$/i;
```

This revised regular expression uses a non-capturing group `(?:\s+\w+)*` to match zero or more occurrences of whitespace followed by word characters, which should be more efficient and less susceptible to ReDoS attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $test_string = "Bad characters: \$\@\#";
my $gdrslt = $test_string;
$gdrslt =~ /^((?=(\w+))\2\s?)*$/i;
```
