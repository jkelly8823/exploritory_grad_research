VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double Free vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a double free vulnerability. This occurs when the `free(ptr)` call is made both inside and outside the if condition `if (abrt)`. If the condition `abrt` is true, the memory pointed to by `ptr` is freed. However, regardless of the condition, the code still attempts to free `ptr` again after the if statement. This can cause undefined behavior and potentially lead to a crash, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, remove the second `free(ptr)` call, as it is not necessary and can cause the double free. If the intention is to ensure that the memory is always freed, consider using a different control flow structure, such as a single `free(ptr)` call after the if condition. Here is an example of the corrected code:

```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;  // Set ptr to NULL after free to prevent further access
}
// Other operations
if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
...if (abrt) {free(ptr);}
...free(ptr);
```
