VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Use of HttpSession. The provided code introduces a potential security vulnerability by directly storing an instance of the `DataGlob` class in the HttpSession. HttpSession is used to store data across multiple requests for a single user. This can potentially lead to an attacker accessing or modifying sensitive data in the HttpSession, performing actions such as session fixation or session hijacking.

EXPLANATION:
The `DataGlob` class instance includes sensitive data in the form of `globName` and `globValue`. When the `addToSession` method is called, it directly adds this instance to the HttpSession, which stores data in a serialized form. This could potentially allow an attacker to serialize a malicious `DataGlob` object and then have the program deserialize it. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other similar vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The `DataGlob` class instance should be stored securely. Instead of storing the `DataGlob` instance directly, only store the required data in a more secure format. Here is an example:

```csharp
public class DataGlob {
    String globName;
    String globValue;

    public void addToSession(HttpSession session) {
        Map<String, String> globMap = new HashMap<>();
        globMap.put("globName", globName);
        globMap.put("globValue", globValue);
        session.setAttribute("glob", globMap);
    }
}
```

In this revised code, instead of storing the `DataGlob` instance directly, we create a `Map` object to store only the required data. This reduces the risk of an attacker being able to manipulate or exploit the stored `DataGlob` instance.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  public class DataGlob {
                        String globName;String globValue;
                           public void addToSession(HttpSession session) {session.setAttribute("glob", this);}
                     }
