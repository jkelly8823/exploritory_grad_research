VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, which allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized user input being used to construct a file path. The code attempts to mitigate this by filtering out '..' from the input. However, this filter is insufficient to prevent directory traversal attacks.

The attacker can still use various techniques to bypass this filter, such as using '.\/' or '.\/\/' to neutralize the filtering. This would allow the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following:

1. Implement proper input validation: Instead of filtering out specific patterns, validate the input to ensure it meets the expected format. Consider using a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters.

2. Use a secure way to construct file paths: Consider using a library that provides a secure way to construct file paths, such as the File::Spec module in Perl.

3. Sanitize file paths: Before serving the file, ensure that the file path does not contain any malicious patterns. Consider using a library that provides file path sanitization, such as the File::Basename module in Perl.

4. Limit the damage: Ensure that the ReadAndSendFile() function can only access files within a specific directory, and not outside of it.

5. Consider using a secure framework: If possible, consider using a web framework that provides built-in security features, such as directory traversal protection.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
