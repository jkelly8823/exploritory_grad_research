VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a simple initialization check within a method. The `initialized` flag is checked, and if it's `false`, the code within the if statement is executed. The flag is then set to `true` after initialization. There are no signs of potential vulnerabilities such as input validation issues, SQL injection, or buffer overflows in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
private boolean initialized = true;
public void someMethod() {
    if (!initialized) {
        // perform initialization tasks
        ...
        initialized = true;
    }
}
```
