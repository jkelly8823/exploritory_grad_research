VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4, 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference. However, more crucially the code is missing bounds checking for `printf`. Since `test_string` is assigned string literals in this code, this is not as impactful. However, given `test_string` is later passed to `printf`, you could introduce a format string vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate `test_string`.

EXPLANATION:
The original code is vulnerable if an attacker could manipulate `test_string` to be a string containing format specifiers (e.g.) `%s`, `%d` %n`. `%n` would be particularly worrying as it can cause the program to write the number of characters processed so far to an attacker controlled location in memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate the vulnerability, ensure that `test_string` is properly sanitized to ensure that it does not contain format specifiers. An even safer alternative is to treat `test_string` as a plain string and use `printf("%s", test_string)`. This can be improved to include bounds checking like this:
```c
printf("%.*s\n", BUFFER_SIZE, test_string);
```
Replace `BUFFER_SIZE` with the size of `test_string`. Ensure that `BUFFER_SIZE` is accurate as setting this too high will truncate the string, potentially resulting in incorrect information being printed.

It is also recommended to make sure the pointer is not null before passing it to `printf`. This can be done with a simple null check:
```c
if (test_string != NULL) {
    printf("%s", test_string);
} else {
    // Handle the error
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char *test_string;
if (i != err_val)
{
test_string = "Hello World!";
}
else {
test_string = "Done on the other side!";
}
printf("%s", test_string);
```
