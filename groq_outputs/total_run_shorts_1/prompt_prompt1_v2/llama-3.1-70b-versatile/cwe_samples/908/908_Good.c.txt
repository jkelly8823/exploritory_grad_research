VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
String Format Vulnerability due to Lack of Null Byte Checking

EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to a string format issue. The string "Hello World!" is reassigned to the pointer `test_string` only if `i` is not equal to `err_val`. However, in the given code snippet, we do not have information about `i` and `err_val` variables. Let's assume that 'i' and 'err_val' could have any value. If 'i' equals 'err_val', the string "Done at the beginning" would be used for 'test_string', and the other way around. 

However, the chief issue with this piece of code lies with how it may later be used. Without proper null byte checking, the given printf function might not cover memory corruption issues fully. Moreover, if at some point this code started being used to format a string into a character array instead of simply printing it out with the %s format specifier, it could potentially be turned into a format string vulnerability.

A simplified view might be that to produce exploitable code, you might need external actors to meddle, giving instructions like this example supports an exploitation possibility using external parameters.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use null byte checking or string pointer null pointer checks in conjunctions before applying it to standard output options (Example: if (test_string != NULL && *test_string != '\0'))
- Use secure functions like `snprintf` or `asprintf` where string lengths and null terminations can be enforced instead of traditional format functions.
- Be sure to define all user facing inputs to aid the definition of which elements are deemed user-controlled and try not to use identical user-facing variables as internal string variables when there is little awareness as to the form variables currently being taken in might not remain string variables of a different type.


ORIGINAL CODE:
		char *test_string = "Done at the beginning";
		if (i != err_val)
		{
		test_string = "Hello World!";
		}
		printf("%s", test_string);
