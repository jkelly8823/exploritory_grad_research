VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure storage logging update command.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is an Azure CLI command that updates the logging configuration for a storage account. The command includes the --account-key option, which is insecure because it exposes the account key directly in the command. This can lead to unauthorized access to the storage account if the key falls into the wrong hands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of providing the account key directly in the command, consider using Azure Active Directory (AAD) credentials or a secure way to store and retrieve the account key, such as Azure Key Vault. Here's a recommended secure way to update the logging configuration:

 az storage logging update --account-name --services b --log rwd --retention 90 --auth-mode login

Alternatively, you can also use the AZURE_STORAGE_KEY environment variable to store the account key securely. Here's how to do it:

az storage logging update --account-name --services b --log rwd --retention 90

Set AZURE_STORAGE_KEY environment variable before running the command:

export AZURE_STORAGE_KEY='account_key'

ORIGINAL CODE:

az storage logging update --account-name --account-key --services b --log rwd --retention 90
