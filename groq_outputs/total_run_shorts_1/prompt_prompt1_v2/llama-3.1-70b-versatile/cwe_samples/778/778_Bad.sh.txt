VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (entire command)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Hardcoded Sensitive Information
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a command-line interface (CLI) command using the Azure CLI tool. However, the command contains two potentially sensitive parameters: `--account-name` and `--account-key`. Hardcoding sensitive information like these directly into the command can pose significant security risks if the code is exposed. An attacker gaining access to this information could compromise the associated Azure storage account. Additionally, using the `--account-key` directly might indicate that the account key is being stored insecurely.

Although there's no line number for vulnerability detection in this case, the entire command itself is vulnerable. The recommendation is to replace the hardcoded sensitive values with a more secure approach.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace `--account-key` with a more secure authentication method like Azure service principals or Azure CLI default authentication.
- Consider using an environment variable or a secrets management solution to store and retrieve sensitive information dynamically.
- If the command is being used in a script or within a DevOps pipeline, ensure proper secrets management is in place to avoid exposing sensitive information.
