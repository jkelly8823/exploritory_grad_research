VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Infinite Retry Loop on Failed Authentication
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to handle the authentication of a user. In the event of an unsuccessful login, the code retries the login process using the `LoginRetry` function. However, there is no logic in place to limit the number of retries. This could potentially lead to an infinite loop, causing excessive strain on system resources and increasing the risk of a denial-of-service attack. Furthermore, an attacker could deliberately trigger the retry loop by attempting to log in with incorrect credentials, leading to potential resource exhaustion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement a retry limit to prevent infinite loops.
- Use a backoff strategy to increase the delay between retries, preventing excessive resource usage.
- Consider adding a delay between retries to slow down potential brute-force attacks.
- Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to block IP addresses that have exceeded the maximum allowed retries.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if LoginUser(){
    // Login successful
    log.warn("Login by user successful.");
    RunProgram();
} else {
    // Login unsuccessful
    log.warn("Login attempt by user failed, trying again.");
    LoginRetry();
}
```
