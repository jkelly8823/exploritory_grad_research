VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains an insecure password comparison using `strcmp` function.

EXPLANATION:
The comparison of the hashed password using `strcmp` function is not secure because this function is vulnerable to timing attacks. If an attacker can measure the time taken to compare the input password with the stored password, they can deduce information about the first differing character, significantly speeding up the process of brute forcing the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a timing attack-resistant comparison function, such as `hash_equals` (as provided by most password hashing libraries) or `yii2-hash_equality` for PHP or `constant_time_equals` for Python, or implement a constant time comparison yourself (using a loop that always runs the same amount of time, regardless of the input).

Alternatively, the code could be revised to use a more secure password comparison library, such as `scrypt`, `bcrypt`, or `PBKDF2`, which uses a slow and salted hash function and includes a secure comparison function.

ORIGINAL CODE:

...getpw(uid, pwdline);for (i=0; i<3; i++){cryptpw=strtok(pwdline, ":");pwdline=0;}result = strcmp(crypt(plainpw,cryptpw), cryptpw) == 0;...
