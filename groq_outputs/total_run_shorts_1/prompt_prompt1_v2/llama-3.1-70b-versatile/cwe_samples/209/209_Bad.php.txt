VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Information Disclosure
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability that can lead to information disclosure. The exception message is being echoed in the `catch` block, which includes the exception message and the configuration file location. This can potentially leak sensitive information to an attacker if an exception occurs.

In this specific example, the `echo` statement includes the location of the configuration file (`$Mysql_config_location`) which could contain sensitive information such as database credentials. By displaying the existence and location of this file, an attacker may be able to infer potential vulnerabilities in the application or gain valuable information for a subsequent attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the code should be modified to handle exceptions in a more secure way. Instead of echoing the exception message, consider logging the error and displaying a generic error message to the user. Additionally, the configuration file location should not be displayed in any error messages.

Here's an example of a revised version of the code snippet:
```
try {
    openDbConnection();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Log the error, including the exception message and config file location (if necessary)
    error_log("Caught exception: " . $e->getMessage() . " - config file: " . $Mysql_config_location);
    // Display a generic error message to the user
    echo "An error occurred while connecting to the database. Please contact support for assistance.";
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
try {openDbConnection();}
//print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
```
