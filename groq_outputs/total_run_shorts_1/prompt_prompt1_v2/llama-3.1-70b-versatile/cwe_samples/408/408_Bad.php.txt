VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Authentication Bypass attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The `file_get_contents` function is used to read the contents of a file specified by the `$filename` variable. However, the `$filename` variable is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious file paths. This could lead to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, where an attacker can access sensitive files on the server.

Additionally, the `isOwnerOf` function is used to check if the user is authorized to access the file. However, this function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its implementation is unknown. If this function is not properly implemented, it could potentially lead to an Authentication Bypass vulnerability.

Furthermore, the use of `echo` to output the file contents can also lead to a security vulnerability if the file contains user-supplied data. If an attacker is able to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the file, it could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Properly sanitize and validate the `$filename` variable to prevent file path manipulation.
2. Implement the `isOwnerOf` function securely to prevent authentication bypass attacks.
3. Use a secure way to output the file contents, such as using `htmlspecialchars` or `json_encode`, to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Here is an updated version of the code that addresses these vulnerabilities:

```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    // Sanitize and validate the filename
    $filename = realpath($filename);
    if (!is_file($filename) || !isOwnerOf($username,$filename)) {
        echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
        return false;
    }

    // Securely output the file contents
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);
    echo htmlspecialchars($file);
    return true;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
        
    //read file into string
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);
    if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
```
