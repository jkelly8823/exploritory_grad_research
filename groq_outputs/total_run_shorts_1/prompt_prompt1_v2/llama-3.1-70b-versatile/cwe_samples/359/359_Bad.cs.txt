VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure through logging. Specifically, it is logging passwords, which is a security risk.

EXPLANATION:
The code is directly logging sensitive information, namely passwords, using the `dbmsLog.WriteLine` function. This can potentially expose the passwords to unauthorized parties if the log file is accessed. This is especially concerning if the passwords are not hashed or encrypted before being logged.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the password should not be logged directly. Instead, consider logging only non-sensitive information or using a secure method for logging sensitive data, such as hashed or encrypted values. If logging passwords is necessary for troubleshooting purposes, consider using a secure method for storing and retrieving the logs.

Additionally, it's recommended to follow best practices for logging sensitive information by:

* Logging hashed or encrypted values instead of plain text
* Limiting access to log files to authorized personnel
* Ensuring log files are stored securely
* Using a secure method for logging sensitive data

ORIGINAL CODE:
pass = GetPassword();...dbmsLog.WriteLine(id + ":" + pass + ":" + type + ":" + tstamp);
