VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a null pointer dereference vulnerability. However, in this case, it's triggering a method call but does not explicitly dereference a null. Instead, this instance will not trigger a null pointer dereference but it's potentially creating an issue elsewhere. A logic flow issue exists in this snippet.
 
EXPLANATION:
The input code snippet checks for a null condition (`if (s != null)`) before making a method call (`Dead()`). However, a closer look at the code suggests a potential issue elsewhere (`Dead()`) is not clearly defined within this given snippet and this method may depend upon or effect further logic potentially hidden elsewhere within the file. Without further information on 'Dead' and the actual scope this snippet can cause an incident potentially hidden elsewhere.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Verify that the `Dead()` method handles the potential inputs (from `s`) consistently and correctly. Add defensive code around this method, validating that `s` actually has the expected value or that other underlying dependencies do not effect this to cause an unexpected condition. When creating null checks, it would also be better if these were not used in a tight together conditional, such as on return.


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  String s = null;if (b) {s = "Yes";return;}
                     if (s != null) {Dead();}
