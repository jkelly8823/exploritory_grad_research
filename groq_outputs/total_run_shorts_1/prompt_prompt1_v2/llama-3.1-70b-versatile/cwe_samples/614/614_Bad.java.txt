VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability in Cookie Handling

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet creates a new cookie with the account ID and adds it to the response. However, the account ID is directly taken from the variable `acctID` without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability if an attacker is able to manipulate the `acctID` variable.

In an IDOR vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the account ID to access unauthorized accounts or data. This is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `acctID` variable to ensure it is legitimate and authorized.
2. Use a secure method to store and retrieve account IDs, such as using a secure token or identifier.
3. Implement proper access controls and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to accounts or data.
4. Consider using a secure cookie flag, such as the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags, to protect against cookie manipulation attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Cookie c = new Cookie(ACCOUNT_ID, acctID);response.addCookie(c);
