VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability.
 
EXPLANATION:
The regular expression `/^\w[\w\-]+$/` used in the given code snippet can potentially cause a ReDoS vulnerability. This occurs because the `\w-` inside a character class is treated as a range instead of a literal hyphen. This can lead to catastrophic backtracking, where the regular expression engine tries to match an enormous number of possibilities, resulting in denial of service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid this vulnerability, it is recommended to properly escape the hyphen character when using it inside a character class. Here is the corrected regular expression:

```perl
if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) {
    # The corrected line of code
    # Escaping the hyphen character:
    if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) # becomes
    if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\\-]+$/) {
        # ... rest of the code
}
```
However, using a more efficient and safer regular expression to validate a name would be more appropriate:
```perl
if ($name =~ /^\w+$/) {
    # This will match one or more word characters
    # No hyphen is allowed in the name.
}
```
In case the intention is to allow hyphens in the name, the corrected regular expression should be:

```perl
if ($name =~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$/) {
    # This will match one or more alphanumeric characters or hyphens
    # The hyphen is only allowed as a separator between alphanumeric characters
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
if ($name =~ /^\w[\w\-]+$/) ...
