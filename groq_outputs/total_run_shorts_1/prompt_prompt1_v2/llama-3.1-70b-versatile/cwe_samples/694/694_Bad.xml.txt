VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Duplicate form element with same name attribute.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes two HTML forms with the same name attribute ("ProjectForm") within the same form-validation element. This can cause issues with form submission and data processing, as the same name attribute is used to identify the form and its associated data. This duplicate naming can lead to unexpected behavior, as the browser may not handle this situation correctly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use unique and distinct names for each form element. This can be achieved by renaming the second form to a unique name. Alternatively, if the intention is to have multiple forms with the same purpose, consider using a single form with multiple sections or tabs.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                   <form-validation>
				   
					 <formset>
					 
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					   <form name="ProjectForm"> ... </form>
					 
					 </formset>
				   
				   </form-validation>
