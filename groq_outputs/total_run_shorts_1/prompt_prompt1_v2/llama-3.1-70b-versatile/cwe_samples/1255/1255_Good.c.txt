VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Timing Attack Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a timing attack. This vulnerability arises from the fact that the code's execution time is dependent on the comparison between the user's input and the stored password. In lines 9 and 11, the code sets a bit in the `password_ok` variable based on the result of the comparison. However, the power consumption is mentioned in the comment, indicating that the code's intention is to prevent side-channel attacks through power consumption analysis. Unfortunately, this implementation does not effectively prevent timing attacks.

In the event of a timing attack, an attacker can measure the time taken by the code to process the input and use this information to deduce the correct password. Since the comparison operation takes longer for correct digits, an attacker can exploit this difference in execution time to infer the correct password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should ensure that the time taken to process each input digit is constant, regardless of whether the digit is correct or not. This can be achieved by introducing a fixed delay after each comparison or by using a constant-time comparison algorithm. Additionally, the code should avoid setting bits in the `password_ok` variable based on the comparison result. Instead, it should use a single variable to store the result and update it only after all digits have been processed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
            static nonvolatile password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
            do
	           
              while (password_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
              password_tries--;  // Put retry code here to catch partial retries
              password_ok = 0;
              for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++)
	     
                if (GetPasswordByte() == stored_password([i])
	       
		 password_ok |= 0x10; // Power consumption here
	       
                else
	       
		 password_ok |= 0x01; // is now the same here
	       
	     
              end
              if ((password_ok & 1) == 0)
	     
                password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
                break_to_Ok_to_proceed
	     
	   
            while (true)
            // Password OK
          
```

Note: The fix will involve modifying the code to ensure constant-time execution for each input digit, which may require introducing additional variables and modifying the comparison logic. However, without the full code context, it's difficult to provide a precise fix. The recommendation above is a general guideline to address the identified vulnerability.
