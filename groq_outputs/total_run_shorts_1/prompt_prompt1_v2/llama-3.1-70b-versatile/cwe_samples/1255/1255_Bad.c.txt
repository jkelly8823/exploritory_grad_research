VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Side-Channel Attack Vulnerability due to Variable Timing.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a part of a password verification system. The vulnerability lies in the difference in timing between the execution of the lines `password_ok |= 1;` and `password_ok |= 0;`. This difference in timing could potentially be used by an attacker to deduce information about the password.

The line `password_ok |= 1;` only executes if the user's input matches a digit in the `stored_password`. The line `password_ok |= 0;` is executed when the input does not match a digit in the `stored_password`. The conditional statements and different executions could result in different timing patterns depending on the input provided, leading to a potential side-channel timing vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remove conditional expressions: Avoid using conditional expressions that can cause variations in execution timing. Instead, use a constant time comparison function.
2. Use a constant time algorithm: Implement an algorithm that executes in constant time, independent of the input provided. This will prevent timing variations that could be exploited by attackers.
3. Mask timing differences: Implement a masking mechanism to ensure that the timing differences between the conditional statements are not noticeable.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static nonvolatile password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
do
    while (password_tries == 0) ; // Hang here if no more password tries
    password_ok = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_PW_DIGITS; i++)
        if (GetPasswordByte() == stored_password([i])
            password_ok |= 1; // Power consumption is different here
        else
            password_ok |= 0; // than from here
        end
    end
    if (password_ok > 0)
        password_tries = NUM_RETRIES;
        break_to_Ok_to_proceed
    password_tries--;
while (true)
// Password OK
```
