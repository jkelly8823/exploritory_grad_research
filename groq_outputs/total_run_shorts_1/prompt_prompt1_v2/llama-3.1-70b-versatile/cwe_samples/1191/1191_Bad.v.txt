VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a timing attack vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the code compares two hash values using a simple if-else statement. If the comparison is done in a way that is dependent on the actual hash values, an attacker may be able to deduce information about the hash values by analyzing the time it takes for the comparison to be made. This could potentially allow an attacker to determine the valid hash value and bypass authentication.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the comparison should be done in a way that is constant time, regardless of the input values. This can be achieved by using a constant time comparison function that always takes the same amount of time, regardless of the input values. Additionally, it is recommended to use a secure hash function that is resistant to timing attacks, such as those provided by libraries like OpenSSL.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
PassChkValid: begin
    if(hashValid) begin
        if(exp_hash == pass_hash) begin
            pass_check = 1'b1;
        end else begin
            pass_check = 1'b0;
        end
        state_d = Idle;
    end else begin
        state_d = PassChkValid;
    end
end
