VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a digital logic circuit description, likely in Verilog or VHDL. The logic is straightforward, assigning a value to `pass_data` based on the state of `pass_mode`. The assignment is well-bound and does not introduce any obvious vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or data leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None are necessary for this snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
logic [511:0] data_d, data_q;
...
logic [511:0] pass_data;
...
Write: begin
    ...
    if (pass_mode) begin
        pass_data = data_d;
        state_d = PassChk;
        pass_mode = 1'b0;
    ...
...
...
```

Please note that without the complete code, it's challenging to evaluate the potential for vulnerabilities. However, based on the provided snippet, no obvious vulnerabilities were detected.
