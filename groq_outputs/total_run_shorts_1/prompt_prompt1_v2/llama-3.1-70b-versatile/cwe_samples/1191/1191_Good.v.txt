VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unbounded Increment of Counter Variable
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the `miss_pass_check_cnt_d` variable is incremented unconditionally when `exp_hash` does not match `pass_hash`. This unbounded incrementation can lead to an overflow vulnerability if the variable is not sufficiently large to accommodate the maximum possible value. Although not shown in the given snippet, a potential integer overflow may occur if the variable `miss_pass_check_cnt_d` has a limited width.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider using a saturating increment (i.e., using a functionality or design that ensures the variable does not overflow), or ensure that the variable `miss_pass_check_cnt_d` has a sufficiently large width to accommodate the maximum possible value. 

Additionally, instead of incrementing `miss_pass_check_cnt_d` indefinitely, consider introducing a limit or threshold beyond which no more increments are allowed. This would prevent a potential overflow due to continuous increments.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```verilog
case (state_q)
    Idle: begin
    ...
        else if ( (dm::dtm_op_e'(dmi.op) == dm::DTM_PASS) && (miss_pass_check_cnt_q != 2'b11) )
        begin
            state_d = Write;pass_mode = 1'b1;
        end
    ...
    end
    ...
    PassChkValid: begin
        if(hashValid) begin
            if(exp_hash == pass_hash) begin
                pass_check = 1'b1;
            end else begin
            pass_check = 1'b0;
            miss_pass_check_cnt_d = miss_pass_check_cnt_q + 1
            // overflow potential if miss_pass_check_cnt_q has limited width
            
            end
            state_d = Idle;
        end else begin
            state_d = PassChkValid;
    end
