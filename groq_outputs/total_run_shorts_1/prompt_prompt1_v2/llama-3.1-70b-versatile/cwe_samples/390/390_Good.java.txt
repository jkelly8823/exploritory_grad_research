VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-7, 16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a 'Denial of Service' (DoS) attack due to the potential for uncontrolled resource consumption and also contains an 'Unsecured File Path' vulnerability. The code also uses a vulnerable method, `FileReader`, which does not validate file extensions or names, potentially allowing attackers to read sensitive data from files.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability in this code is that it opens a file by name without validating or sanitizing the name first. This makes it vulnerable to both 'Denial of Service' and 'Unsecured File Path' attacks. An attacker can provide a malicious filename (for example, a filename that points to a directory or a device file), potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or security issues.

If the file supplied is large, the code creates a character array with its length. This can consume a lot of memory, potentially causing a 'Denial of Service' attack.

The use of 'FileReader' also makes the code vulnerable to reading sensitive data from files. For example, if the file path provided by an attacker is not the one that the program's author intends, it could lead to unexpected results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate and sanitize the filename before using it to open a file. This should prevent 'Denial of Service' and 'Unsecured File Path' attacks.
- Instead of reading the entire file into memory, use a buffered stream to read the file in manageable chunks.
- Use 'FileInputStream' instead of 'FileReader' to prevent reading sensitive data from files.
- Use 'try-with-resources' to ensure that the file is properly closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String readFile(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, Exception {
    String retString = null;
    try {
        // initialize File and FileReader objects
        File file = new File(filename);
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
        // initialize character buffer
        long fLen = file.length();
        char [] cBuf = new char[(int) fLen];
        // read data from file
        int iRead = fr.read(cBuf, 0, (int) fLen);
        // close file
        fr.close();
        retString = new String(cBuf);
    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
        System.err.println ("Error: FileNotFoundException opening the input file: " + filename );
        System.err.println ("" + ex.getMessage() );
        throw new FileNotFoundException(ex.getMessage());
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        System.err.println("Error: IOException reading the input file.\n" + ex.getMessage() );
        throw new IOException(ex);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        System.err.println("Error: Exception reading the input file.\n" + ex.getMessage() );
        throw new Exception(ex);
    }
    return retString;
}
