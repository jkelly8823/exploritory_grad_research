VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to infinite recursion.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to the potentially infinite recursion in the `do_something_recursive` function. The function calls itself without any termination condition until `flg` is 0, but there is no validation to ensure that `flg` will ever reach 0. If `flg` remains non-zero, the function will continue to recursively call itself, consuming stack space until the program crashes.

Additionally, if the initial condition never reaches 0 and is not correctly transformed, it may cause a DEADLOCK situation due to the exhaustion of system resources.

In a real-world scenario, if an attacker could control the value of `flg`, they could potentially cause a denial-of-service attack by forcing the program to exhaust its stack space.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a proper validation should be performed to ensure that the recursion will terminate. Here are some potential solutions:

* Validate the input to `do_something_recursive` to ensure it meets the requirements.
* Use a loop instead of recursion to avoid the risk of stack overflow.
* Implement a counter to limit the number of recursive calls.
* Ensure that the `flg` is correctly transformed to eventually reach 0.

For example, you can modify the code to use a loop instead of recursion:

```c
void do_something_loop(int flg) {
    while (flg) {
        // Do some real work here
        // Modify value of flg on done condition
        // flg should eventually reach 0
    }
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_loop(flag);
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    ... // Do some real work here
    // Modify value of flg on done condition
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // returns when flg changes to 0
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
