VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite recursion vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a function `do_something_recursive` that calls itself recursively without modifying the condition that determines whether the recursion continues. In this case, the variable `flg` is never changed within the recursive function, causing the function to call itself indefinitely until the stack overflows. This is a classic example of an infinite recursion vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the recursive function should have a proper base case that stops the recursion. In this case, `flg` should be decremented or modified in some way to eventually reach a base case that stops the recursion. Here is an example of a fixed version:

```
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    if (flg == 0) {
        return; // Base case: stop the recursion
    }
    ... // Do some real work here
    do_something_recursive (flg - 1); // Decrement flg to eventually reach the base case
}
int flag = 10; // Set to a finite value
do_something_recursive (flag);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void do_something_recursive (int flg)
{
    ... // Do some real work here, but the value of flg is unmodified
    if (flg) { do_something_recursive (flg); }    // flg is never modified so it is always TRUE - this call will continue until the stack explodes
}
int flag = 1; // Set to TRUE
do_something_recursive (flag);
```
