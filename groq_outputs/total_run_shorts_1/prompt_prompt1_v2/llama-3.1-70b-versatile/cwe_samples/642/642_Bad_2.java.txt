VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains a potential Path Traversal vulnerability and a potential NullPointerException.

EXPLANATION:
The code reads a property from a configuration object `cfg` and directly uses it to construct a file path. This can be exploited if the property value contains malicious input, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive files on the system. 

Furthermore, if `fis.read(arr)` returns -1, which indicates the end of the file, `amt` will be a negative value, which could cause issues in subsequent operations that rely on `amt` being a valid value. Additionally, there is no null check or try-catch block to handle potential exceptions that may occur while reading from the file. This can lead to NullPointerExceptions if the file cannot be read.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Perform validation and sanitization on the input from `cfg.getProperty("sub")` to ensure it only contains expected characters and does not contain malicious input. 
2.  Handle exceptions that may occur while reading from the file. This includes adding proper error handling for IOException and NullPointerException.
3.  Verify the return value of fis.read(arr) before operating on it to prevent issues with invalid values.
4.  Use a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the FileInputStream is properly closed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt");  
amt = fis.read(arr);
out.println(arr);
