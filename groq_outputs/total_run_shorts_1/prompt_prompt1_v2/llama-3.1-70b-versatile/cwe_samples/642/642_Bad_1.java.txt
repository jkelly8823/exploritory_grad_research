VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack via unsanitized user input.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses an unsanitized and unchecked user input (rName) to construct the path of a file. This allows an attacker to potentially access and delete files outside of the intended directory. An attacker could input a string containing directory traversal characters (e.g., '../') to manipulate the file path. This could lead to the deletion of sensitive files or even system files, resulting in potential system compromise or data loss.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform the following steps:

1. Validate user input: Implement input validation to restrict the characters allowed in the reportName parameter. This could include using a whitelist of allowed characters or using a specific format.
2. Use a secure path construction method: Instead of concatenating the user input to the file path, use a method that securely constructs the path. This can be achieved using the `File` class constructor with the `File` class as the parent directory.
3. Use a safe file delete operation: Use a library like `Files.deleteIfExists()` to safely delete the file, which provides better error handling.
4. Implement proper error handling: Always check the return values of file operations (e.g., delete) to handle potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");
File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);
...
rFile.delete();
```
