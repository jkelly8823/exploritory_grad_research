VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 35-36
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The code is vulnerable to a register tampering issue through the scan_mode or debug_unlocked bypass, which allows an attacker to modify the Data_out register even when the Lock bit is set.
EXPLANATION:
 The vulnerability arises because the conditions for writing to Data_out are not strictly restricted to when the write signal is asserted and the Lock bit is clear. The presence of the scan_mode and debug_unlocked conditions essentially bypass the intended protection provided by the Lock bit. This allows for registers to be modified in a way that was not intended by the system designer.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Review the logic surrounding the usage of scan_mode and debug_unlocked signals.
2.  Ensure that the scan_mode and debug_unlocked signals are properly secured and not directly externally controllable.
3.  Consider the impact of overriding the lock bit for these modes, and implement further checks or control logic to restrict access to Data_out.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module Locked_register_example
(
    input [15:0] Data_in,
    input Clk,
    input resetn,
    input write,
    input Lock,
    input scan_mode,
    input debug_unlocked,
    output reg [15:0] Data_out
);

    reg lock_status;
    
    always @(posedge Clk or negedge resetn)
    
        if (~resetn) // Register is reset resetn
        begin
        
            lock_status <= 1'b0;
        
        end
        else if (Lock)
        begin
        
            lock_status <= 1'b1;
        
        end
        else if (~Lock)
        begin
        
            lock_status <= lock_status;
        
        end
      
        always @(posedge Clk or negedge resetn)
        
        if (~resetn) // Register is reset resetn
        begin
        
            Data_out <= 16'h0000;
        
        end
        else if (write & (~lock_status | scan_mode | debug_unlocked) ) // Register protected by Lock bit input, overrides supported for scan_mode & debug_unlocked
        begin
        
            Data_out <= Data_in;
        
        end
        else if (~write)
        begin
        
            Data_out <= Data_out;
        
        end
  
        endmodule
```

Note:  Given the circumstances and based on what we're presented with here, you may want to rethink the security model tied into data_in and scan_mode to avoid direct register manipulation, however an exact solution to this issue is beyond this evaluation, and depends on system-level details.
