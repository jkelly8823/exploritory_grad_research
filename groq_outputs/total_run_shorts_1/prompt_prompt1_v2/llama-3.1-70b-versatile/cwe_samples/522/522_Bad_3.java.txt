VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (evaluating properties file)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: hardcoded sensitive information
EXPLANATION:
This is a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file. Storing secret usernames and passwords directly in plain text, as seen in 'webapp.ldap.username=secretUsernamewebapp.ldap.password=secretPassword' lines, poses a significant security risk. Hardcoding sensitive information directly into the codebase increases the risk of unauthorized access in the event of source code or server compromise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It's highly recommended to use secure and environment-specific configuration storage solutions for sensitive information. Here are some strategies:
1. External configuration files: Store sensitive information in separate configuration files that are not version-controlled or accessible to development teams.
2. Environment variables: Set sensitive information as environment variables on the server where the application is deployed.
3. Key Management Systems: Use established key management systems to securely store and manage credentials.
4. A secure secrets storage mechanism (e.g. Hashicorp's Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager): Use industry-approved mechanisms to safely handle and retrieve sensitive information.
