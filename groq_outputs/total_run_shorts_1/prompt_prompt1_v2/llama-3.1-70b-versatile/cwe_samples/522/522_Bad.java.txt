VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to credential exposure. 

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code is reading a password from a properties file (config.properties) and then using it directly in the DriverManager.getConnection call without any encryption. This potentially exposes the password to unauthorized access, as configuration files can sometimes be leaked or accessed without proper security controls.

However, considering the scenario might vary based on the context such as file location, file permissions and environment, further investigation would be essential for complete validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store sensitive information (like passwords) in a secure manner. 
   Instead of hard-coding the password in the properties file, consider using environment variables or secure storage solutions.

2. Encrypt sensitive information. 
   Use a secure encryption algorithm to protect sensitive information in transit and at rest.

3. Apply the least privilege principle.
   Limit the privileges of the user or service that accesses the configuration file, reducing potential damage in case of unauthorized access.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Properties prop = new Properties();
prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));
String password = prop.getProperty("password");
DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);
