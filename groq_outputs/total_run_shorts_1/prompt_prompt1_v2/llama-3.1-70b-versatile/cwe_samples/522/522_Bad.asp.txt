VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Credentials

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, including the username ("uid=db2admin") and password ("pwd=password"). This poses a significant security risk, as an attacker who gains access to the code can obtain sensitive database login credentials.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive credentials securely, such as by using environment variables or a secrets management system. Additionally, consider using a more secure method of authentication, such as Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) or a token-based authentication mechanism.

ORIGINAL CODE:
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
