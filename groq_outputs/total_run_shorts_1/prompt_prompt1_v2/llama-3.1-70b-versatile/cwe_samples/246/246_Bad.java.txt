VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has a potential resource leak vulnerability due to the lack of proper socket closure in the event of an exception.

EXPLANATION:
The code creates a new Socket object and assigns it to the sock variable. However, in the event of an exception, the sock variable is not properly closed, which can lead to resource leaks. This is because the catch block does not have a provision to close the socket.

Furthermore, the fact that the comment says "Remote server (bad)" indicates that the socket is potentially connecting to an untrusted or unauthenticated server. This could lead to additional vulnerabilities such as arbitrary data injection, or exploitation of a server-side vulnerability.

However, note that the risk of this vulnerability cannot be fully evaluated without further information about the 'remoteHostname' variable and its validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to ensure that the socket is properly closed in the event of an exception. This can be achieved by using a try-finally block, or better yet, using the try-with-resources statement, which automatically closes the socket when it goes out of scope.

Here's a simple example of how to safely close the socket:

```java
try (Socket sock = new Socket(remoteHostname, 3000)) {
    // Do something with the socket.
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle the exception.
}
```

Furthermore, validation of 'remoteHostname' should be performed to ensure it is not contaminated with user-provided data.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    
    // Perform servlet tasks.
    ...
    
    // Open a socket to a remote server (bad).
    Socket sock = null;
    try {
        sock = new Socket(remoteHostname, 3000);
        
        // Do something with the socket.
        ...
    } catch (Exception e) {...}
}
```
