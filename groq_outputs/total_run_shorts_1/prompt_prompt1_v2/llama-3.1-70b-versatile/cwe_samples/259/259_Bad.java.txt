VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials in a connection string.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains hardcoded credentials ("scott" and "tiger") in a connection string to a database. Storing sensitive information such as database credentials directly in the code poses a significant security risk. If an unauthorized party gains access to the code, they can extract these credentials and use them to access the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modifications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to store sensitive information such as database credentials securely using environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets management solution. These credentials should not be committed to version control systems.

Additionally, consider using a more secure method for database authentication, such as using a username and password stored in a secure manner, or using an authentication mechanism like Kerberos or OAuth.

Example of secure code:
```java
String dbUsername = System.getenv("DB_USERNAME");
String dbPassword = System.getenv("DB_PASSWORD");
DriverManager.getConnection(url, dbUsername, dbPassword);
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
DriverManager.getConnection(url, "scott", "tiger");
