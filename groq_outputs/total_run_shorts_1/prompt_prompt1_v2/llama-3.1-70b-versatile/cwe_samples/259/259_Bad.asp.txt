Hardcoded sensitive data

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded sensitive data, specifically a database password ("pwd=password"). Hardcoding sensitive data directly in the code is a major security risk, as it can be easily accessed by anyone with access to the code. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database and potential data breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is highly recommended to avoid hardcoding sensitive data directly in the code. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store and retrieve sensitive data. This can include using a configuration file or a secure key-value store to store sensitive information.

Here is a revised example of how the connection string could be defined with sensitive data stored in environment variables:

 ```
 <connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=${DB_USERNAME}; pwd=${DB_PASSWORD}; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>
 
 // Set DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD environment variables
 // to the actual credentials
 ```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  ...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
