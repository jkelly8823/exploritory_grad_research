VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a hardcoded password comparison, which is a clear-text password storage vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `VerifyAdmin` function compares the provided password to the hardcoded string "Mew!". This approach poses a significant security risk because it stores the password in clear text, making it easily accessible to unauthorized individuals. Hardcoding passwords in source code is a fundamental security mistake. If an attacker gains access to the source code or decompiles the application, they will be able to obtain the hardcoded password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following:

1.  Use a secure password hashing library to store hashed versions of passwords instead of storing them in clear text.
2.  Store the hashed passwords securely, ideally using a secure storage solution or a separate configuration file with restricted access.
3.  When verifying the provided password, hash it using the same hashing library and compare the result with the stored hashed password.
4.  Consider implementing additional security measures, such as:
    *   Salting passwords to make precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) ineffective.
    *   Using a pepper or a secret key stored securely on the server to prevent attackers from creating rainbow tables.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
int VerifyAdmin(String password) {
    if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {
        return(0)
    }//Diagnostic Mode
    return(1);
}
```
