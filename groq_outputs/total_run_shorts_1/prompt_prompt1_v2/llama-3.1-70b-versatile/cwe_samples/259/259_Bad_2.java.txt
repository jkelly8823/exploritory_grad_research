VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Sensitive Data

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals hardcoded sensitive data, including a username and password for LDAP authentication. It is a significant security risk to hardcode sensitive information directly into the code, especially if it is not properly secured. An attacker with access to this code can easily obtain the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Use environment variables: Instead of hardcoding sensitive data, use environment variables to store sensitive information. This way, the data is not committed to the version control system and can be secured separately.

2. Use a secure secret management system: Implement a secure secret management system that can securely store and manage sensitive data. This can be done using tools like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

3. Use a properties file that is not committed to the version control system: If the properties file is not committed to the version control system, the hardcoded sensitive data is not exposed to potential attackers. However, ensure that the properties file is adequately secured.
