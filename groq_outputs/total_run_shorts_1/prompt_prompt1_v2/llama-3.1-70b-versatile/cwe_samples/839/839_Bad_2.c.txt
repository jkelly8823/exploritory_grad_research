VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access and use of an undefined value.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided function `getValueFromArray`, the code checks if the `index` is less than the `len` to ensure a valid array access. However, in the `else` block, the code still attempts to access the array at the `index` and prints the value, even though the `index` is out of bounds. This is a classic case of an out-of-bounds array access vulnerability. Additionally, the code assigns `value = -1` in the `else` block, but the `value` is not guaranteed to be initialized in all cases.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code should remove the line that accesses the array in the `else` block and only return an error value when the `index` is out of bounds. The corrected `else` block should be:
```
else { printf("Error: Invalid index\n"); value = -1; }
```
Additionally, to avoid undefined behavior, it's recommended to initialize the `value` variable before the conditional statement:
```c
int value = -1;
if (index < len) {
    value = array[index];
} else {
    printf("Error: Invalid index\n");
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {
    int value;
    if (index < len) {
        value = array[index];
    } else {printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);value = -1;}
    return value;
}
```
