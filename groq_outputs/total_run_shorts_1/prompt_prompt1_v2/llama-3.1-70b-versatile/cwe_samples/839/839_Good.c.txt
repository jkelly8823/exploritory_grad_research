ORIGINAL CODE ANALYSIS LIMITED TO SURROUNDING LINES - PROVIDED CODE STARTS ON THE LINE IF (index >= 0 && index < len)
VULNERABLE_LINES:  The provided line 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Array Index Out of Bounds Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
Although it appears that there's an attempt to validate the array index in the provided code snippet by checking if it's within the range of 0 to len-1, there are still potential issues as the provided code does not verify if the len is 0. If len is 0 (i.e., an empty array), any index (except in languages with different behaviors such as R, SAS or in Python with numpy library in safe mode) would technically meet the condition but none should actually exist. A second concern exists if this checking is within a method accessing an array defined earlier (so still existing), and len is updated outside and changed to 0 between the assignation of len and the use of it as with an update len after (access is before), than index might later exceed valid range, and the safety you think you have - isn't there.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
A safer validation check would involve verifying that len > 0. You could update this line to also check if len > 0, like so:

if (len > 0 && index >= 0 && index < len)

By making this modification, you will ensure that you are not attempting to access an index in an empty array.

ORIGINAL CODE:

if (index >= 0 && index < len)
