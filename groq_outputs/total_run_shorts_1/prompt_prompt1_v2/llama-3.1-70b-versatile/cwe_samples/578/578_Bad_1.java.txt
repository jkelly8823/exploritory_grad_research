VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability related to insecure class loading. The `CustomClassLoader` is used to load and instantiate classes dynamically, which can lead to SecurityManager bypass or arbitrary code execution attacks.
EXPLANATION:
The use of `ClassLoader` to load classes dynamically is inherently insecure if not carefully implemented. This can lead to loading of arbitrary classes and potentially malicious code execution. In this case, the `CustomClassLoader` class does not perform any input validation or classpath filtering, making it vulnerable to loading any class. Additionally, creating class instances through `newInstance()` can also lead to invoking constructor methods that can execute arbitrary code.
The use of `ClassLoader` can be insecure when loading classes from untrusted sources. In addition, the use of `newInstance()` is also insecure and deprecated since Java 9. Instead, use `getDeclaredConstructor()` to create instances safely.
The potential vulnerabilities addressed here can include insecure class loading, arbitrary code execution, or SecurityManager bypass.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use secure class loading mechanisms like `URLClassLoader` or `SecureClassLoader`, and load classes from trusted sources only. 
2. Implement classpath filtering or input validation in the `CustomClassLoader` to restrict class loading.
3. Use `getDeclaredConstructor()` instead of `newInstance()` to create class instances safely.
Here's an example of how you can implement the recommendations:

```java
@Stateless
public class LoaderSessionBean implements LoaderSessionRemote {
    public LoaderSessionBean() {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("file://path/to/trusted/classes");
            URLClassLoader loader = new URLClassLoader(new URL[] {url});
            Class c = loader.loadClass("someClass");
            Constructor<?> constructor = c.getDeclaredConstructor();
            Object obj = constructor.newInstance(); // consider using any constructor parameters where relevant
            //... use the loaded class instance
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            //... handle the exception
        }
    }

    // No custom class loader implementation needed
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
@Stateless
public class LoaderSessionBean implements LoaderSessionRemote {
    public LoaderSessionBean() {
        try {
            ClassLoader loader = new CustomClassLoader();
            Class c = loader.loadClass("someClass");
            Object obj = c.newInstance();
            /* perform some task that uses the new class instance member variables or functions */
            ...} catch (Exception ex) {...}
    }
    public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    }
}
```
