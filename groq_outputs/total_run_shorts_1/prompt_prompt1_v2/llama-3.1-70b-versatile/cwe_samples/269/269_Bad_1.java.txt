VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, allowing a user to potentially elevate their role by modifying the `role` attribute of the `requestingUser` object.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes the `role` attribute from the `requestingUser` object directly and uses it to control access to sensitive information. However, it does not verify that the `role` attribute has not been modified by the user. This is a problem because the `role` attribute is being taken from the user's object, which can potentially be manipulated by the user. By modifying this attribute, a user could potentially elevate their role to `ADMIN` or any other role.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should not rely on the `role` attribute being passed by the user. Instead, the user's role should be retrieved from a secure and trusted source, such as a database or an authentication system. Additionally, access control checks should be implemented to ensure that the user's role is valid and has not been modified.

 ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public enum Roles {ADMIN,USER,GUEST}
public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
    if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
        switch(requestingUser.role){
            case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
            default:System.out.println(currentDebugState());break;
        }
    }else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
}
```
