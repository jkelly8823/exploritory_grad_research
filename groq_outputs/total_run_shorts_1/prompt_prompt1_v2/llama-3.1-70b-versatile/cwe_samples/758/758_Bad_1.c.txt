VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dangling Pointer Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The function `getName()` allocates a character array `name` on the stack with size `STR_MAX`. The `fillInName(name)` function is called to fill in the name. However, the function then returns a pointer to the `name` array, which is allocated on the stack and is no longer valid once the function returns. This results in a dangling pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior and potential security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function should allocate memory for the `name` array on the heap using a function such as `malloc()`, or it should pass the `name` array as a parameter to the function. This will ensure that the `name` array remains valid even after the function returns.

Here's an example of how to allocate memory on the heap:

```c
char* getName() {
    char* name = malloc(STR_MAX);
    if (name == NULL) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure
    }
    fillInName(name);
    return name;
}
```

And here's an example of how to pass the `name` array as a parameter:

```c
void getName(char* name, size_t size) {
    if (size < STR_MAX) {
        // Handle buffer size error
    }
    fillInName(name);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char* getName() {char name[STR_MAX];fillInName(name);return name;}
```
