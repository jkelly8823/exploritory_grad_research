VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential vulnerability due to the storage of a password as a plaintext character array.

EXPLANATION:
In this snippet, a password is stored as a plaintext character array (`char* password`). This can lead to security issues as passwords should never be stored in plaintext. An attacker could potentially access this memory location, revealing the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to store passwords securely using a password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. These algorithms slow down the password hashing process, making it more resistant to bruteforce attacks. The hashed password can then be stored instead of the plaintext password.

Storing sensitive data, like passwords, should be done using a secure storage solution, and access to this data should be restricted.

Here's an example using a simplified hashing function in C++ (please note that this example should not be used in production due to the simplicity of the hashing function):

```cpp
private: 
std::string hashedPassword;

public:
void setPassword(const std::string& password) {
  hashedPassword = hashPassword(password); // hashPassword is a placeholder for a secure hashing function
}

std::string verifyPassword(const std::string& inputPassword) {
  return hashPassword(inputPassword); // Compare the hashed input password with the stored hashed password
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  private: char* password;
