VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The UserAccount class stores password information in plain text.

EXPLANATION:
The class UserAccount stores the username and password in char arrays. This could potentially be a vulnerability if the password is not being hashed or encrypted before being stored. Storing passwords in plain text is a major security risk, as it means that if an attacker gains access to the data, they will be able to read the passwords directly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of storing the password in plain text, consider using a secure hashing algorithm (such as bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2) to store the hashed password. When a user attempts to log in, hash their input and compare it to the stored hash. This way, even if the database is compromised, the attacker will only have access to the hashed passwords.

 ORIGINAL CODE:
                  class UserAccount{public:...
                     
                     private:char username[MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH+1];char password[MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH+1];};
