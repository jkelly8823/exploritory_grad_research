VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly concatenates user-provided input (`databaseName`) into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `databaseName` variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on the database, including data theft, degradation, or destruction.

For example, an attacker could provide a `databaseName` value such as `database_name; DELETE FROM users;`, which would result in the deletion of all users in the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL queries. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Here's how to modify the code:
```java
private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("DROP DATABASE ?");
        pstmt.setString(1, databaseName);
        pstmt.execute();
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```
Using prepared statements with parameterized queries will help ensure that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL query.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
private void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```
