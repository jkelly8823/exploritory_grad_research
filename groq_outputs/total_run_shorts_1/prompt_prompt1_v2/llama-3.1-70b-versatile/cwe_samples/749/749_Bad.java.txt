VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `removeDatabase` method is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is because it directly concatenates user-provided input (`databaseName`) into a SQL statement, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. An attacker could exploit this by passing a specially crafted `databaseName` value that includes SQL syntax, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use a prepared statement with parameterized query instead of directly concatenating user input into the SQL statement. This will help prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user input is properly sanitized and treated as a parameter rather than as part of the SQL code.

Here is an example of how the code can be modified:

```java
public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        String query = "DROP DATABASE ?";
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
        pstmt.setString(1, databaseName);
        pstmt.execute();
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```

Alternatively, if the database does not support parameterized queries for the `DROP DATABASE` statement, ensure that the `databaseName` input is thoroughly validated and sanitized before use to prevent any potential SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public void removeDatabase(String databaseName) {
    try {
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();stmt.execute("DROP DATABASE " + databaseName);
    } catch (SQLException ex) {...}
}
```
