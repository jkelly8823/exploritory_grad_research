VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

EXPLANATION:
The code takes untrusted user input from the URL query string and writes it directly to a UIWebView. This input is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can lead to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the webview, potentially revealing sensitive user data or hijacking user sessions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should properly validate and sanitize the input from the URL query string. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1.  Validate the input: Check if the input conforms to a specific expected format or pattern. If it does not, reject it.
2.  Sanitize the input: Remove any suspicious or malicious characters from the input. This can be done by using a whitelisting approach, where only known good characters are allowed.
3.  Use a secure way to write data to the webview: Instead of using `[self writeDataToView:[URL query]]`, consider using a secure method that does not execute JavaScript code directly, such as loading a new request or using a JavaScript bridge that provides a safer way to interact with the webview.

ORIGINAL CODE:


// iOS
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
          NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
                
               
               // Make data available back in webview.
               UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
         }return NO;
   }return YES;
