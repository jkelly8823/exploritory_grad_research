VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: (the entirety of the given class but specifically referencing the getUsersInfo method), 
                   the exact line number would be available if the entire file was accessible, this
                   appears to be line 3 (JavaScriptInterface()) or more precisely line 4 (@JavascriptInterface). 
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is utilizing Android's JavaScriptInterface annotation to expose a Java method (getUserInfo) to JavaScript. Given the power this exposes to the JavaScript runtime, 
it raises concerns about potential injection style attacks if the webpage is not correctly configured or has other such vulnerabilities present within. This could allow a malicious attacker to inject 
vicious JavaScript that JavaScriptInterface may execute, leading to multiple malicious attacks.


EXPLANATION:
Upon evaluating this segment of code, the primary concern revolves around the use of JavaScriptInterface, which grants access to a Java method (getUserInfo) within the JavaScript runtime. 
Given the risks this poses if the webpage in question does not implement proper validation and has other vulnerabilities present, using JavaScriptInterface without proper validation and checking raises cause for concern.
The class is a simple final Java class designed to interface with JavaScript code. We see a User class and a User's private "Info" being returned by the getUserInfo method.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To eliminate this vulnerability, consider using more secure means of exchanging data between JavaScript and Java logic. If using JavaScriptInterface is necessary, apply robust validation 
and type checks before handling the data exchange. One alternative can be utilizing Volley or OkHttp to make native HTTP requests. The current implementation does not take such 
measures and leaves potential attack doors open, thus making potential unauthorized calls by an attacker difficult to repel.


ORIGINAL CODE:
final class JavaScriptInterface {
    JavaScriptInterface () { }
    @JavascriptInterface
    public String getUserInfo() { return currentUser.Info(); }
}
