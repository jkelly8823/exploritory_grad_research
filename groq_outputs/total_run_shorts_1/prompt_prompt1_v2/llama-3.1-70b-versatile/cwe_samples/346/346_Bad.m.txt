VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `NSURLRequest` object is being processed based on its scheme and function string without proper validation and sanitization. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and command injection vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, the function attempts to extract data from the `resourceSpecifier` and `query` components of the `NSURLRequest` object. The data extracted from these components is used to make data available back in the `UIWebView`. However, there is no validation or sanitization of this data before it is used in the web view. This could potentially lead to XSS attacks if an attacker is able to inject malicious data into the URL. Additionally, if the `resourceSpecifier` or `query` components contain user-controlled data, this could also lead to command injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, proper validation and sanitization should be performed on the data extracted from the `resourceSpecifier` and `query` components of the `NSURLRequest` object. This can be achieved by:

1. Validating the scheme and function string against a whitelist of allowed values.
2. Escaping or sanitizing any user-controlled data before using it in the web view.
3. Using a secure protocol such as HTTPS instead of a custom scheme.
4. Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the types of content that can be loaded in the web view.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```objectivec
-(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType{
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];
    if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]){
        NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];
        if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]){
            // Make data available back in webview.
            UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
        }
        return NO;
    }
    return YES;
}
