VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect allocation and lack of robust error checking.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is allocating memory using the `malloc` function. However, the check for the return value of `malloc` is insufficient. The condition `if (tmp < 0 )` will not catch all cases where the allocation has failed. This is because `malloc` returns a null pointer on failure, not a negative value. The comparison should be against `NULL` to correctly identify allocation failures.

Additionally, the check only covers allocation failures, and does not validate the size of the allocated memory, leaving it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, always check the return value of memory allocation functions against `NULL` and validate the size of the allocated memory. Also, consider using `calloc` instead of `malloc` for allocations of an array of objects, which allows for more precise error checking.

```cpp
tmp = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);
if (tmp == NULL ) {
    perror("malloc");
    exit(1); // or handle error
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
tmp = malloc(sizeof(int) * 4);if (tmp < 0 ) {
    perror("Failure");
    //should have checked if the call returned 0
}
```
