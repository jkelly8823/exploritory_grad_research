VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1, 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to an Authentication Bypass and Potential Broken Access Control, as it relies on an unsanitized cookie value for authorization decisions, allowing an attacker to manipulate the 'role' cookie to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet retrieves a user's role from a cookie, which is an insecure way to store and retrieve authentication data. Since the value of the 'role' cookie is directly used to make authorization decisions, an attacker could easily manipulate the cookie to impersonate a different role, such as 'Reader' in this case. Moreover, there is no validation or sanitization of the cookie value before it is used, further increasing the vulnerability.

Furthermore, if the 'role' cookie is not set or if getRole('user') is null, the application may rely on an insecure default role of 'Reader' or any other default value assigned by getRole('user'). 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Store authentication and authorization data securely on the server-side, using a session management mechanism, instead of relying on client-side cookies.

2. Validate and sanitize any user input, including cookie values, before using them for authorization decisions.

3. Use secure mechanisms to assign and manage user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive information.

4. Implement additional access control checks to ensure that even if an attacker manipulates the cookie, they will still not be able to access sensitive information without proper authorization.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$role = $_COOKIES['role'];if (!$role) {$role = getRole('user');if ($role) {// save the cookie to send out in future responsessetcookie("role", $role, time()+60*60*2);}else{ShowLoginScreen();die("\n");}}if ($role == 'Reader') {DisplayMedicalHistory($_POST['patient_ID']);}else{die("You are not Authorized to view this record\n");}
```
