VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The input from the `GetUntrustedInput()` function is used to construct a file path, which is then used to read and send a file using the `ReadAndSendFile()` function. Although the code attempts to prevent directory traversal by removing "../" from the input, it does not account for other traversal sequences, such as "/..//", "/./", or "/../" (with spaces). Additionally, it does not validate the input to ensure it only contains allowed characters.

Furthermore, even if the input only contains allowed characters, an attacker could still exploit this vulnerability by sending a string that, when concatenated with "/home/user/", points to a sensitive file outside the intended directory. For example, if an attacker sends a string like "public_html/etc/passwd", the code would attempt to read and send the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

The vulnerability is located on line 3, where the input is used to construct the file path.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input: Ensure that the input only contains allowed characters, and that it does not contain any traversal sequences.
2. Use a whitelist: Instead of trying to filter out malicious input, use a whitelist to only allow specific, known-good input.
3. Use a secure way to construct file paths: Use a library or function that securely constructs file paths, such as the `Path::Tiny` module in Perl.
4. Avoid using user input to construct file paths: Consider using a different approach, such as storing files in a database or using a different way to identify files.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
