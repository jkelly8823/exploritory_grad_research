VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated File Input and Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code provided uses user-supplied input (sys.argv[1]) to construct a file path without proper validation. This allows an attacker to potentially traverse the file system by providing a specially crafted filename, such as "../../sensitive/file.txt". The use of `os.path.join` helps prevent some path traversal attacks, but it is not sufficient to prevent all attacks. Additionally, the lack of input validation increases the likelihood of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Validate user-supplied input before using it to construct a file path. Ensure that the input is within the expected format and does not contain suspicious characters.
- Use the `pathlib` module and its functions to safely manipulate paths and prevent path traversal attacks.
- Consider using a whitelisting approach to restrict access to specific directories or files.
- Implement proper error handling and error messages that do not reveal sensitive information about the file system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
import os
import sys
def main():
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
            file_data = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("Error - file not found")
main()
```
