VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability, which can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. This vulnerability arises when the code allows user-controlled input (in this case, `sys.argv[1]`) to specify a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to traverse the file system, potentially accessing sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`.

The vulnerable lines (`path = ...` to `with open(path, 'r') as f:`) create a file path using `os.path.normpath()`, which does not prevent traversal attacks. If an attacker were to pass in a specially crafted file path (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`), the code would resolve it to an absolute path and attempt to read the file.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the file path provided by the user. A possible approach is to:

1. Use a whitelist of allowed file paths or extensions to restrict access to specific files or directories.
2. Use `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.basename()` to verify that the resolved file path does not traverse the intended directory.
3. Consider using a more secure method of reading files, such as using a library that provides path canonicalization (e.g., `pathlib`).

Example of a possible fix:
```python
import os
import pathlib

...

filename = sys.argv[1]
allowed_dir = '/path/to/allowed/directory'
allowed_extensions = ['.txt', '.csv']

file_path = pathlib.Path(filename)
if not file_path.is_absolute():
    file_path = pathlib.Path(allowed_dir) / file_path

if file_path.suffix.lower() not in allowed_extensions:
    print("Error - Invalid file extension")
    sys.exit(1)

try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        file_data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print("Error - file not found")
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
import os
import sys
def main():
    
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    path = os.path.normpath(f"{os.getcwd()}{os.sep}{filename}")
    try:
       
        with open(path, 'r') as f:
           
            file_data = f.read()
           
       
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
       
        print("Error - file not found")
       
    main()
```
