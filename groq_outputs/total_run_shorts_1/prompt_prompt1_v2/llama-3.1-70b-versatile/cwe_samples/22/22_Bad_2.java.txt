VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability and Insufficient Input Validation.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code segment is vulnerable to Path Traversal and lacks sufficient input validation. 
The vulnerability exists due to the possibility of manipulating the filename variable by injecting malicious input, specifically the file path. 
This could allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations in the server's file system.

Additionally, the uploadLocation is appended directly to the filename without any validation or sanitization, providing the attacker with full control over the final file path. 
This weakness could be exploited by sending a malicious filename with directory traversal characters (e.g., "..\..\file.txt") to upload a file to an arbitrary location in the server's file system.

Furthermore, the 'FileWriter' class is used with the 'uploadLocation+filename' as the file path. 
If 'uploadLocation' is not properly configured or contains a relative path, an attacker may be able to traverse the file system by providing a malicious filename with relative directory paths.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the filename to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Use the 'java.nio.file.Paths' class to normalize and validate file paths before writing files to the server's file system.
- Ensure that 'uploadLocation' is an absolute path and properly configured to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Use a more secure way of writing files to the server's file system, such as using a temporary directory or a secure file upload library.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class FileUploadServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // ...
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // ...
        String filename = pLine.substring(pLine.lastIndexOf("\\"), pLine.lastIndexOf("\""));
        // ...
        try {
            BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(uploadLocation+filename, true));
            // ...
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            // ...
        }
        // output successful upload response HTML page
    } else {
        // output unsuccessful upload response HTML page
    }
    // ...
}
