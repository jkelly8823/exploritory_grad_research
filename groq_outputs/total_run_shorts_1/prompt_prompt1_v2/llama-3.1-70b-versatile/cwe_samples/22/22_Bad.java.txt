VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability due to an unchecked property value.

EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves a filename from a system property (`System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile")`) and uses it to create a new File object. This is a common pattern for configuration-driven file access. However, the property is not validated or sanitized, which can lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate the system property to point to an arbitrary file on the system, potentially leading to unauthorized file access.

Additionally, using system properties can make the application vulnerable to configuration tampering, where an attacker can change the property value without modifying the code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the input filename to prevent path traversal. You can use methods like `File.getCanonicalPath()` to normalize the path and then compare it with the expected directory.
2. Use a secure, configuration-driven file access mechanism, such as loading the filename from a trusted configuration source and validating its format and content.
3. Consider using a more secure approach, like storing the file in a secure location or using a file access API that is desigend to be safe against path traversal attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String filename = System.getProperty("com.domain.application.dictionaryFile");
File dictionaryFile = new File(filename);
