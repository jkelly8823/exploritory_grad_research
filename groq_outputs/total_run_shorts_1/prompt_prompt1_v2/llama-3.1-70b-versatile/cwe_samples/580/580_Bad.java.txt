VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Cloneable Implementation 

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, both `Kibitzer` and `FancyKibitzer` classes override the `clone()` method but do not follow the standard cloning pattern. Specifically, the `Kibitzer` class creates a new instance using `new Kibitzer()`, while the `FancyKibitzer` class correctly calls `super.clone()`. However, without the proper implementation of the `Cloneable` interface, this can lead to a security vulnerability.

The insecurity is in the fact that, when `Kibitzer` is cloned, a new instance is created that bypasses any defensive copying. This could potentially be exploited if an attacker could manipulate the state of the cloned object and the original object refers to a mutable object.

In addition, the fact that the cloning is done using `Object.clone()` also poses an issue since it performs a shallow copy. This can lead to unintended and potentially exploitable behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement the `Cloneable` interface on both classes to ensure that cloning is properly implemented.
- Instead of calling `super.clone()` directly in the `FancyKibitzer` class, ensure that any cloned objects are properly copied to prevent bypassing of defensive copying. 
- Overwrite the `clone()` method in `Kibitzer` to use `super.clone()` or implement a `clone()` method that safely and correctly clones the object's state.
- Instead of returning a raw `Object`, consider returning the actual type of the object being cloned. This could also hint at other potential design issues with the classes.
- Finally, always make sure to document any use of cloning, along with implementing any defensive copying needed due to object's mutability state.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class Kibitzer {
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = new Kibitzer();
        ...
    }
}

public class FancyKibitzer extends Kibitzer{
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Object returnMe = super.clone();
        ...
    }
}
```
