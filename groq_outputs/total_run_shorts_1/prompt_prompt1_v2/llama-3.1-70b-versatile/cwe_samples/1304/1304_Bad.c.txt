VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4, 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to potential memory leaks and dangling pointers due to the use of raw void pointers without proper memory management.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, the `save_config_state()` function calls `get_config_state()` which returns a `void*` pointer that is assigned to `cfg`. The function then calls `save_config_state(cfg)`, passing the `cfg` pointer. However, the ownership and lifecycle of the memory pointed to by `cfg` are not clear. If `get_config_state()` dynamically allocates memory, it is not being freed, leading to a potential memory leak. 

Similarly, in the `restore_config_state()` function, the `get_config_file()` function returns a `void*` pointer that is assigned to `cfg`. The function then calls `load_config_file(cfg)`, passing the `cfg` pointer. Again, the ownership and lifecycle of the memory pointed to by `cfg` are not clear. If `get_config_file()` dynamically allocates memory, it is not being freed, leading to a potential memory leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these potential vulnerabilities, proper memory management should be implemented. Here are some steps to consider:

1. Identify the ownership and lifecycle of the memory pointed to by `cfg` in both `save_config_state()` and `restore_config_state()`. If the memory is dynamically allocated, ensure that it is properly freed when no longer needed.
2. Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) to manage the memory instead of raw void pointers.
3. Consider using a more type-safe approach, such as using a specific struct or class to hold the configuration state instead of a void pointer.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```cpp
void save_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    cfg = get_config_state();
    save_config_state(cfg);
    go_to_sleep();
}

void restore_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    cfg = get_config_file();
    load_config_file(cfg);
}
```
