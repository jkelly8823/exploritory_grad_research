VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The provided code snippets appear to be using recursion without a clear termination condition and there is no proper memory management in place for the allocated memory.

EXPLANATION:
In the `save_config_state()` function, the code is calling `save_config_state(cfg)` recursively without any clear terminal condition, which will lead to a stack overflow error. However, given that `cfg` is of type `void*`, it seems likely that this might be a copy-paste error.  Instead, the correct line might be to save `cfg` itself as the actual config state to be persisted.

The lines of code indicated may also indicate a memory leak if `get_config_state`, `get_hash_of_config_state`, and similar functions allocate memory that is not then freed. It's also worth noting that there is a missing check for whether the functions `get_config_state`, `get_hash_of_config_state`, `save_config_state`, `get_config_file`, `get_persisted_sha_value` and `get_hash_of_config_state` return NULL before using the returned values.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to use an iterative approach rather than recursion or verify the code flow with base case to handle recursion correctly.

It is also recommended to verify that there is proper memory management. It is also recommended to add checks to ensure that the returned values of `get_config_state`, `get_hash_of_config_state`, `save_config_state`, `get_config_file`, `get_persisted_sha_value` and `get_hash_of_config_state` are not NULL or NULL checks can be added in all the methods before actually returning pointers .

Additionally, use `free` to release the allocated memory once it is no longer needed. Also consider using smart pointers to manage memory, depending on the rest of the project's style and considerations.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void save_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    void* sha;
    
    cfg = get_config_state();
    save_config_state(cfg);
    
    // save hash(cfg) to trusted location
    sha = get_hash_of_config_state(cfg);
    save_hash(sha); 
    
    go_to_sleep();
}

void restore_config_state()
{
    void* cfg;
    void* sha_1, sha_2;
    
    cfg = get_config_file();
    // restore hash of config from trusted memory
    sha_1 = get_persisted_sha_value();
    
    sha_2 = get_hash_of_config_state(cfg);
    if (sha_1 != sha_2)
    
        assert_error_and_halt();
    
    load_config_file(cfg);
}
```
