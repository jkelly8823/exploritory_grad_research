VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The `method-permission` element in the provided `ejb-jar` configuration grants access to the `getSalary` method of the `Employee` EJB to anyone. This potentially allows unauthorized access to sensitive employee data.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet allows access to sensitive employee data (salary) to anyone who has access to the system. By granting `ANYONE` access to this method, it increases the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To remediate this vulnerability, the access control should be restricted to only authorized roles. It is recommended to replace the `role-name` `ANYONE` with a more specific and secure role name, e.g., `HR_MANAGER` or `SysAdmin`, depending on the organizational access policies.
