VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `AuthenticateUser` function uses `strncmp` to compare the input password with the stored password. However, the `strncmp` function is used with the length of the input password, which can be longer than the stored password. If the input password is longer than the stored password, `strncmp` will compare the excess characters, which are not initialized, leading to undefined behavior. Additionally, the use of `strlen` to get the length of the input password is also a security concern as it does not prevent buffer overflow attacks. In line 6, `strncmp` is used again with the stored password as the first argument, but the comparison is done up to the length of the input password, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input password is longer than the stored password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, the code should use `strcmp` instead of `strncmp` to compare the passwords. `strcmp` will compare the strings until a null terminator is found, preventing buffer overflow. Additionally, the code should check the length of the input password before comparing it with the stored password to prevent buffer overflow. The password comparison should be done securely using a secure string comparison function like `memcmp`.

ORIGINAL CODE:


/* Ignore CWE-259 (hard-coded password) and CWE-309 (use of password system for authentication) for this example. */
                     char *username = "admin";char *pass = "password";
                     int AuthenticateUser(char *inUser, char *inPass) {if (strncmp(username, inUser, strlen(inUser))) {logEvent("Auth failure of username using strlen of inUser");return(AUTH_FAIL);}if (! strncmp(pass, inPass, strlen(inPass))) {logEvent("Auth success of password using strlen of inUser");return(AUTH_SUCCESS);}else {logEvent("Auth fail of password using sizeof");return(AUTH_FAIL);}}
                     int main (int argc, char **argv) {
                     int authResult;if (argc < 3) {ExitError("Usage: Provide a username and password");}authResult = AuthenticateUser(argv[1], argv[2]);if (authResult == AUTH_SUCCESS) {DoAuthenticatedTask(argv[1]);}else {ExitError("Authentication failed");}}
