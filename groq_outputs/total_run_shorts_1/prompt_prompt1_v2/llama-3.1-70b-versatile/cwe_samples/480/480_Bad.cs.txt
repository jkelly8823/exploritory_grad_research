VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the incorrect usage of an assignment operator instead of a comparison operator.

EXPLANATION:
The issue lies in the condition `if (value=100)`. In C-based languages, the assignment operator is `=`, and the comparison operator is `==`. In this case, the code assigns the value 100 to the variable `value` instead of comparing it. This results in the if condition always being true because the assignment operation `value=100` returns a non-zero value, which is considered true in a boolean context. This is a classic example of a bug that can be introduced by a single character difference.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the comparison operator `==` should be used instead of the assignment operator `=`. The corrected line should read `if (value == 100)`. This will ensure that the condition is evaluated correctly, and the function behaves as intended.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  bool isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {Console.WriteLine("Value is valid.");return true;}Console.WriteLine("Value is not valid.");return false;}
