VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to incorrect assignment in the conditional statement.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code, the conditional statement in the `isValid` function uses a single equals sign (=) instead of a double equals sign (==). This causes the code to assign the value 100 to the `value` variable, rather than checking if `value` is equal to 100. As a result, the condition will always be true, leading to incorrect behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, replace the single equals sign with a double equals sign in the conditional statement. The corrected code should read as follows:

```c
int isValid(int value) {
    if (value == 100) {
        printf("Value is valid\n");
        return(1);
    }
    printf("Value is not valid\n");
    return(0);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int isValid(int value) {if (value=100) {printf("Value is valid\n");return(1);}printf("Value is not valid\n");return(0);}
```
