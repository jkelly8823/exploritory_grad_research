VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines two parameters, `MEM_SIZE` and `JTAG_OFFSET`, in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog. These parameters define constants used in the design. The values assigned to these parameters appear to be arbitrary and do not pose any security risk. The snippet lacks any data processing or external input handling that could potentially introduce a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as it does not contain any vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
parameter  MEM_SIZE = 100;
localparam JTAG_OFFSET = 100;
