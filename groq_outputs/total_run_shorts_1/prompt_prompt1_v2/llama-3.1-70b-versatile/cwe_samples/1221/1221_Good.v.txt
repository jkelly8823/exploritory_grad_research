VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Hardcoded Constant Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet instantiates a module called `register_example` and assigns a value of 1225 as the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter. The presence of a hardcoded value as a default for `REGISTER_DEFAULT` flag may potentially introduce a vulnerability if this value is considered sensitive.

The comment next to the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` value suggests that this value enables a "Secure_mode". Using a hardcoded value for a security-sensitive setting can be problematic if the value is not correct or is changed without updating this code. Furthermore, if this code is publicly accessible, this value is now publicly known.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to replace the hardcoded value with a configurable variable. This variable should be initialized with a value that is securely generated or stored. This allows the value to be updated without changing the code, ensuring that the "Secure_mode" can be correctly enabled or disabled without exposing sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
register_example #( 
		.REGISTER_WIDTH (32), 
		.REGISTER_DEFAULT (1225) // Correct default value set, to enable Secure_mode 
	      ) Secure_Device_ID_example ( 
	      
		.Data_in (Data_in), 
		.Data_out (Secure_reg), 
		.Clk (Clk), 
		.resetn (resetn), 
		.write (write) 
	      );
```
