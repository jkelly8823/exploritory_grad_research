VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 SQL Injection due to unsanitized user input.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the `runEmployeeQuery` function call, where the `$_GET['EmployeeName']` value is not properly sanitized before being used as a parameter. Although the query uses a prepared statement, which is a good practice, the `name` parameter in the prepared statement is directly bound to the potentially tainted `$_GET['EmployeeName']` value, allowing for potential SQL injection.

However, in this code snippet, I couldn't see the actual execution of the SQL prepared statement being vulnerable but in case user-controlled data directly goes to database query which may cause a disaster, better will be verifying all untrusted data whether it's coming from server or client before putting it in SQL query.

 For example, consider an attacker could construct a string by manipulating the `EmployeeName` GET parameter to inject SQL commands. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Sanitize all the untrusted user data before putting them into a database query can be done by using functions like `mysqli_real_escape_string()` ,trim(), filter based on validation user inputs.

Consider using white-list input validation or prepared statements that allow you to use parameterized queries can be used as alternatives.
Also, a general coding practice recommendation is to always validate  inputs in either server side or client side , whether the untrusted user data comes from or not.

Additionally, verifying all the database writes with conditions is also being a best practices and limiting database access to service users for enhanced secure performance monitoring.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  function runEmployeeQuery($dbName, $name){mysql_select_db($dbName,$globalDbHandle) or die("Could not open Database".$dbName);
                        //Use a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89
                        $preparedStatement = $globalDbHandle->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');$preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name));return $preparedStatement->fetchAll();}
                     /.../
                     
                     $employeeRecord = runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB',$_GET['EmployeeName']);
