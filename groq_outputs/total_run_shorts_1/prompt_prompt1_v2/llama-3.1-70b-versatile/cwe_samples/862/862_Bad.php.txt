VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability and potential SQL Injection vulnerability in error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, as it directly uses user input (`$_GET['EmployeeName']`) to access employee records without proper authorization and validation. This could potentially allow attackers to access sensitive information about other employees.

Additionally, although the code uses a prepared statement to avoid SQL injection, it does not validate or sanitize user input. This means that the code still relies on die() for error handling, which could potentially reveal sensitive database information if an attacker manipulates the query.

Furthermore, using die() is not secure as it can reveal sensitive information about the database or the script's internal workings.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize user input: Before using user input, validate it to ensure it conforms to expected formats and sanitize it to prevent potential security issues.

2. Implement proper error handling: Instead of using die(), use try-catch blocks to handle errors and display generic error messages to users.

3. Implement proper authorization and access control: Ensure that users can only access their own employee records or have proper authorization to access other records.

4. Use whitelisting for database queries: Only allow specific database operations based on user input.

5. Consider using a more secure query execution mechanism, such as PDO or a more modern ORM.

ORIGINAL CODE:

                  function runEmployeeQuery($dbName, $name){mysql_select_db($dbName,$globalDbHandle) or die("Could not open Database".$dbName);
                        //Use a prepared statement to avoid CWE-89
                        $preparedStatement = $globalDbHandle->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');$preparedStatement->execute(array(':name' => $name));return $preparedStatement->fetchAll();}
                     /.../
                     
                     $employeeRecord = runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB',$_GET['EmployeeName']);
