VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unrestricted Server Port Usage and Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet creates a server socket on a fixed port and waits for incoming connections. However, this approach presents two potential vulnerabilities. Firstly, using a fixed port number increases the risk of attacks targeting the server, especially if the port is well-known. Moreover, the lack of input validation on the used port number can lead to the server binding to a system-reserved or protected port, potentially causing unintended behavior. Additionally, the unlimited loop `while(listening)` that repeatedly calls `start()` can cause the system to create multiple threads with the same characteristics. This may lead to resource exhaustion, causing the server to become unresponsive to legitimate requests.

Furthermore, the `public StockSymbolBean()` calls the `start()` method, which can be problematic due to potential concurrency issues since the bean's thread instance is not guaranteed to complete before a new instance is created and `start()` is called.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Define a flexible server port configuration mechanism that takes into consideration restricted or reserved ports.
- Implement proper port range validation, ideally by using a combination of configuration parameters and the `SecurityManager.checkListen( port )` method.
- Update the server initialization process to eliminate the loop and only instantiate a single server socket instance that monitors incoming connections.
- Apply proper concurrency control when starting a server socket instance from a multithreaded bean architecture, using `synchronized` blocks or atomic operations as necessary.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
@Stateless
public class StockSymbolBean extends Thread implements StockSymbolRemote {
    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
    Socket clientSocket = null;
    boolean listening = false;
    public StockSymbolBean() {
        try {
            serverSocket = new ServerSocket(Constants.SOCKET_PORT);
        } catch (IOException ex) {...}
        listening = true;
        while(listening) {start();}
    }
    public String getStockSymbol(String name) {...}
    public BigDecimal getStockValue(String symbol) {...}
    public void run() {
        try {clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
        } catch (IOException e) {...}...
    }
}
