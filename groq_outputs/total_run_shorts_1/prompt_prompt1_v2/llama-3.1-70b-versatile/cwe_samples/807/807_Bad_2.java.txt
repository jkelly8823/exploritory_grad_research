VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, as well as a possible DNS Rebinding attack. The code also relies on reverse DNS resolution, which is not a secure method for determining the trustworthiness of a client.

EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves the client's IP address and resolves it to a hostname using the `InetAddress.getByName()` method. It then checks if the hostname ends with "trustme.com" to determine if the client is trusted. However, this approach is vulnerable to SSRF attacks, as an attacker can manipulate the `request.getRemoteAddr()` value to make it resolve to a hostname that ends with "trustme.com", even if the client is not coming from that domain.

Additionally, relying on reverse DNS resolution is not a secure method for determining the trustworthiness of a client, as DNS records can be manipulated or spoofed. It is also possible that the client's IP address may be behind a NAT or a proxy, which could make the reverse DNS resolution unreliable.

The code is also vulnerable to DNS Rebinding attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the DNS response to make it point to a different IP address, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the trust check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of relying on reverse DNS resolution, consider using a more secure method for authenticating and authorizing clients, such as using a trust anchor or a certificate-based authentication mechanism.

Also, consider validating the client's IP address against a list of trusted IP addresses or networks, rather than relying on DNS resolution.

Finally, consider implementing additional security controls, such as rate limiting or IP blocking, to prevent abuse of the trust check mechanism.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
    trusted = true;
}
```
