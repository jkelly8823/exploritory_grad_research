VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential infinite loop in the case statement, where multiple cases have the same action assigned.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains a finite state machine implemented in Verilog. The inputs to the module are user_input, clk, and rst_n. The state is assigned based on the user_input value. However, the case statement has multiple cases with the same action: for inputs 3'h0, 3'h1, 3'h2, and 3'h3, the state is assigned 2'h3. This could potentially lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix is to ensure that each case in the case statement has a unique action assigned to it. If the intent is to assign the same state to multiple inputs, a single case statement with multiple values can be used. For example:

```
case (user_input)
  3'h0, 3'h1, 3'h2, 3'h3: state = 2'h3;
  3'h4: state = 2'h2;
  3'h5: state = 2'h1;
endcase
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
module fsm_1(out, user_input, clk, rst_n);
input [2:0] user_input; 
input clk, rst_n;
output reg [2:0] out;
reg [1:0] state;
always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n )
begin
  if (!rst_n)
    state = 3'h0;
  else
    case (user_input)
      3'h0:
      3'h1:
      3'h2:
      3'h3: state = 2'h3;
      3'h4: state = 2'h2;
      3'h5: state = 2'h1;
    endcase
end
out <= {1'h1, state};
endmodule
```
