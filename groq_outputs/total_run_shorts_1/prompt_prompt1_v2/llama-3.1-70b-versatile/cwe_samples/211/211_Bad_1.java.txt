VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Error Handling
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains insecure error handling. In the catch block for `RuntimeException`, it prints the input file path to the standard error stream. This can potentially reveal sensitive information about the system or application to an attacker.

The issue arises from the fact that error messages should not include sensitive information that can be used by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the system. Instead, they should provide generic messages that inform the user about the error without revealing sensitive details.

In the given case, the code prints the input file path, which could be used by an attacker to gather information about the system or application.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the error message should be modified to not include the input file path. A generic message that indicates an error occurred while trying to open the input file would be sufficient. Additionally, it's recommended to log the error with the sensitive information, but only in a secure manner that prevents it from being accessed by unauthorized parties.

Here's a possible fix:

```java
catch (RuntimeException rex) {
    System.err.println("Error: Cannot open input file.");
    // Log the error with sensitive information
    logger.error("Error opening input file in directory: {}", inputFilePath);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class InputFileRead {
    
    private File readFile = null;
    private FileReader reader = null;
    private String inputFilePath = null;
    private final String DEFAULT_FILE_PATH = "c:\\somedirectory\\";

    public InputFileRead() {
        inputFilePath = DEFAULT_FILE_PATH;
    }

    public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {

        /* Assume appropriate validation / encoding is used and privileges / permissions are preserved */

    }

    public void readInputFile() {
        try {
            reader = new FileReader(readFile);
            ...
        } catch (RuntimeException rex) {
            System.err.println("Error: Cannot open input file in the directory " + inputFilePath);
            System.err.println("Input file has not been set, call setInputFile method before calling readInputFile");

        } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
            ...
        }

    }
}
```
