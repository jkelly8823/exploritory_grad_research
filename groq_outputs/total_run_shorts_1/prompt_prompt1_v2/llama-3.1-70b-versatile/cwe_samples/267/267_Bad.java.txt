VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate authorization check leading to potential elevation of privilege.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be part of a debugging or logging functionality. However, it uses a simple switch statement to control access based on the user's role. The issue arises from the fact that the default case in the switch statement grants access to the current debug state without properly verifying if the user has the necessary permissions.

In this scenario, any user who is not a guest (i.e., has a role other than GUEST) can potentially access the debug state, which could be considered a security issue if the debug state contains sensitive information. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or potentially even elevation of privilege.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, a more comprehensive authorization check should be performed. This could involve:

* Adding additional cases to the switch statement to Verify the user's role and ensure they have the necessary permissions to access the debug state.
* Replacing the switch statement with a more robust authorization mechanism, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
* Implementing a more fine-grained access control mechanism to restrict access to specific debug state information based on the user's role or permissions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  public enum Roles {ADMIN,USER,GUEST}
                     public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
                        if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
                              switch(requestingUser.role){
                                    case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
                                       default:System.out.println(currentDebugState());break;
                                    
                                 }
                           }else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
                     }
