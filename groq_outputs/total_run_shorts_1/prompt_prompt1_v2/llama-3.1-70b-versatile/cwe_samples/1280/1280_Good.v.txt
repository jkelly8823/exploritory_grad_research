VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper Input Validation and Information Exposure.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the condition where the `grant_access` is assigned a value based on the `usr_id` being equal to `3'h4`. This implies that the system grants access to sensitive data (`data_out`) when the `usr_id` matches a specific value. However, the code does not validate whether the input `data_in` is genuine or maliciuous. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by sending arbitrary data through `data_in` when `usr_id` is `3'h4`, thus exposing sensitive information or causing unintended behavior.

Moreover, the hard-coded value `3'h4` in the condition could potentially expose sensitive information about the system's authentication mechanism.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement proper validation and authentication mechanisms to verify the input `data_in` and the `usr_id`. This could include adding checks for the type and range of `data_in` and introducing a more secure authentication protocol.
2. Consider using a more secure approach to store sensitive values such as the authorized `usr_id`, such as using a secure key management system or encryption.
3. Ensure that all input data, including `data_in` and `usr_id`, are sanitized and validated to prevent potential attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
        ALWAYS @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
        begin
        
        if (!rst_n)
        
          data_out = 0;
        
        else
        
          assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
          data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
        
          
      end
        endmodule
