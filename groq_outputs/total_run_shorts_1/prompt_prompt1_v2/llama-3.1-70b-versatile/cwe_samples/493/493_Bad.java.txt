VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Insecure Direct Object Reference Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is present in the method "LookupPrice("MyWidgetType")", which is not shown in this code snippet. However, the potential vulnerability is with how the input "MyWidgetType" is being used to look up a price. If the string "MyWidgetType" is later replaced with user input without proper validation or sanitization, it can lead to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious input to access sensitive prices or potentially altering price data.

However, since the method LookupPrice is not shown in this code snippet and the input "MyWidgetType" is hardcoded, it is uncertain if an actual vulnerability exists. Without further context, the exact vulnerability cannot be determined.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent potential IDOR vulnerabilities when using the LookupPrice method with user input:

1. Validate user input against a whitelist of allowed values.
2. Sanitize user input by removing any special characters.
3. Implement proper error handling and authentication when interacting with sensitive price data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
public final class WidgetData extends Applet {
    public float price;
    ...  
    public WidgetData(...) {
        this.price = LookupPrice("MyWidgetType");
    }
}
