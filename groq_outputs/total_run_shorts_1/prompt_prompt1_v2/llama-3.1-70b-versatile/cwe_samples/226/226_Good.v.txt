VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability and potential information disclosure due to a lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the 'address' variable.

EXPLANATION:
The 'address' variable is used as an index in a case statement, which could potentially lead to an IDOR vulnerability if the input is not properly validated and sanitized. Additionally, if the 'address' variable is not properly bounded, it could lead to an array index out of bounds error, potentially causing the system to crash or disclose sensitive information. Furthermore, the fact that the case statement is not shown in the code snippet raises concerns about potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the input 'address' is properly validated and sanitized before being used as an index in the case statement. This can be achieved by adding bounds checking and ensuring that the 'address' variable is within a valid range. Additionally, the case statement should be reviewed to ensure that it does not provide unauthorized access to sensitive data.

ORIGINAL CODE:
module aes0_wrapper #(...)(...);
...
always @(posedge clk_i)

begin

  if(~(rst_ni && ~rst_1)) //clear p_c[i] at reset

    ...
  
  else if(ct_valid) //encryption process complete, clear p_c[i]

    begin
     
      p_c[0] <= 0;
      p_c[1] <= 0;
      p_c[2] <= 0;
      p_c[3] <= 0;
     
    end
  
  else if(en && we)
  
    case(address[8:3])
    ...
    endcase
  
  end // always @ (posedge wb_clk_i)
