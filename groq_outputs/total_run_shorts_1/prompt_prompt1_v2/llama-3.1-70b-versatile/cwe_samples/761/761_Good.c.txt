VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-7, 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet has a dangling pointer vulnerability. If the function `cointains_char` successfully finds the character and returns `SUCCESS`, it frees the memory allocated for the string, but if the function returns `FAILURE` after iterating over the entire string, it also frees the memory. However, if an error occurs while copying the string or an exception is thrown during the iteration, the memory might not be freed, leading to a memory leak. Additionally, the line `i = i + 1;` can be optimized.

EXPLANATION:
The `strcpy` function does not check for buffer overflow, which can lead to undefined behavior. Moreover, in the loop, `strlen(str)` is called on each iteration, which is inefficient as the length of the string remains the same throughout the function. However, the main concern here is that the memory is freed only after the loop or when a match is found, which means if an error or exception occurs during the execution of the loop, the memory will leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Instead of using `strcpy`, consider using `strncpy` which allows specifying the maximum number of characters to copy, thus preventing buffer overflow.
- Instead of using `strlen(str)` in the loop condition, store the length of the string in a variable before the loop.
- Use a more robust way to handle memory allocation errors. 
- Consider using more efficient string library functions, such as `strchr`, to simplify the function and improve performance.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SUCCESS (1)
#define FAILURE (0)
int cointains_char(char c){
    char *str;int i = 0;
    str = (char*)malloc(20*sizeof(char));
    strcpy(str, "Search Me!");
    while( i < strlen(str) ){
        if( str[i] == c ){
            /* matched char, free string and return success */
            free(str);return SUCCESS;
        }
        /* didn't match yet, increment pointer and try next char */
        i = i + 1;
    }
    /* we did not match the char in the string, free mem and return failure */
    free(str);return FAILURE;
}
```
