VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Buffer Overflow and Use After Free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION: 
There are two vulnerabilities in this code snippet. 

The first vulnerability is a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. In line 6, the code uses `strcpy( command, tok );` to copy the token into the `command` buffer. This function does not perform any boundary checking, which means that it will write data to the buffer until it encounters a null-terminator. If the length of the token exceeds the length of the buffer, this will result in a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The second vulnerability is a Use After Free vulnerability. In lines 6 and 21, the code frees the `input` and `command` buffers, respectively. However, before freeing the `input` buffer in line 21, the code uses the `tok` pointer to iterate over the tokens in the input string. This is a problem because `strtok` returns a pointer to the token in the original buffer, and if the buffer is freed, this pointer becomes invalid. If the `tok` pointer is used after the buffer has been freed, the program will access memory that it is no longer allowed to access, potentially resulting in a crash or other undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use safer string functions like `strncpy` or `strcpy_s` instead of `strcpy`. These functions allow you to specify the size of the buffer and will prevent buffer overflows.
2. Avoid using `strtok` or use a safer alternative like `split` or `explode`. If using `strtok`, make sure to keep track of all the returned pointers and free them after use.
3. Consider using smart pointers or a garbage collector to manage memory automatically.
4. Check the length of the token before copying it to the `command` buffer to prevent buffer overflows.
5. Make sure to free the `command` buffer after using it to prevent memory leaks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
                       //hardcode input length for simplicity
                       char* input = (char*) malloc(40*sizeof(char));char *tok, *command;char* sep = " \t";
                       get_user_input( input );
                     
                       /* The following loop will parse and process each token in the input string */
                     
                       tok = strtok( input, sep);while( NULL != tok ){
                          if( !isMalformed( command ) ){
                                 
                                 /* copy and enqueue good data */
                                 command = (char*) malloc( (strlen(tok) + 1) * sizeof(char) );strcpy( command, tok );add_to_command_queue( command );
                           }tok = strtok( NULL, sep));
                     }
                     free( input )
