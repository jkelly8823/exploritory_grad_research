VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains a potential security vulnerability due to the direct output of user input (`acctNo`) without proper sanitization or encoding. This can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code is directly outputting the `acctNo` variable, which is likely to be user input or sensitive data. In case an attacker is able to inject malicious data into this variable, the output will not be sanitized or encoded, leading to the potential execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the client's browser. This is particularly concerning since this code is within an `if` statement that checks the state of a debugging flag, which might not be thoroughly tested or validated for security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the output of the `acctNo` variable should be properly sanitized and encoded to prevent XSS attacks. Here are a few recommendations:

1.  Use a templating engine's built-in encoding functionality to ensure that output is properly sanitized.
2.  Manually encode the output using methods like `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4()` from Apache Commons or a similar API.

Original Code Snippet with Recommendations Applied:

```java
<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
    String sanitizedAcctNo = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(String.valueOf(acctNo));
 %>User account number: <%= sanitizedAcctNo %><%} %>
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
<% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {%>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
