VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet does not close the socket in case of an exception, potentially leading to a resource leak. The lack of a finally block or a try-with-resources statement also suggests that the PrintWriter might not be properly closed either.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet attempts to establish a socket connection to a remote host. If an exception is thrown during the connection setup or subsequent data transmissions, the socket and PrintWriter are left open. This can lead to a resource leak, as the underlying system resources are not released, potentially causing issues with concurrent connections or exhausting the available system resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the code should utilize a try-with-resources statement or a finally block to ensure that the socket and PrintWriter are properly closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

```java
try (Socket sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);
     PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true)) {
    // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
    ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a try-catch block with a finally block to close the socket and PrintWriter:

```java
Socket sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream(), true);
try {
    // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
    ...
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle exception
} finally {
    out.close();
    sock.close();
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
Socket sock;PrintWriter out;
try {
    sock = new Socket(REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT);out = new PrintWriter(echoSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
       
    // Write data to remote host via socket output stream.
    ...
}
```
