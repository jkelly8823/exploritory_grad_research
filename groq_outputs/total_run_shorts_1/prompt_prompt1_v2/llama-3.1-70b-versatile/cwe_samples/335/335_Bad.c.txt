VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Use of Pseudo-Random Number Generator
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the srand() function to seed the pseudo-random number generator with the current time and then uses rand() to generate a random number. However, this approach is insecure because it can be predictable. srand() uses the time in seconds since the epoch as the seed, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. This can lead to the prediction of the random numbers generated by rand(). This is particularly concerning in scenarios where randomness is crucial, such as in cryptographic applications or simulations of randomness-dependent systems.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using srand(time()) and rand(), consider using a secure random number generator, such as the one provided by the operating system (e.g., reading from /dev/urandom) or a cryptographic library like OpenSSL. If available, use the std::random_device and std::mt19937 classes from the C++ Standard Library for generating random numbers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
srand(time());int randNum = rand();
