 Predictable Random Number Generation

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the `java.util.Random` class with a fixed seed (`SEED`) to generate a random account ID. This means that the sequence of numbers generated will be the same every time the program is run. An attacker who knows the seed value can predict the sequence of account IDs, potentially leading to account enumeration or unauthorized access.

The issue lies in the fact that the same seed is used every time a random number is generated. Additionally, the use of `random.nextInt()` without specifying the bounds can lead to negative numbers, which might not be desirable for an account ID.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid predictable random number generation, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) such as `java.security.SecureRandom` instead of `java.util.Random`. Also, use a random seed that is difficult to predict, such as a value derived from the system's entropy or a cryptographically secure random number.

Here's an example of how to use `SecureRandom`:

```java
private static final SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();

public int generateAccountID() {
    return secureRandom.nextInt(100000); // specify a positive maximum value
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
                 private static final long SEED = 1234567890;public int generateAccountID() {Random random = new Random(SEED);return random.nextInt();}
