Insecure Random Number Generation

EXPLANATION:
The provided code uses the `Random` class in Java, seeded with the system's current time in milliseconds, to generate a random account ID. However, this approach has several security concerns. The seed is easily guessable, and the `Random` class is not designed to be cryptographically secure. As a result, an attacker may be able to predict or reproduce the generated account IDs, which could lead to authentication bypass or other security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To generate cryptographically secure random numbers, consider using the `java.security.SecureRandom` class instead. This class uses a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, which is more suitable for generating session IDs, account IDs, or other security-related random numbers.
Here is an example of how to use `SecureRandom`:

```java
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
int accountID = secureRandom.nextInt();
```

Additionally, if you need to retrieve a specific range of integers (e.g., for a certain number of account IDs), consider using the `nextInt(int bound)` method that takes a bound to restrict the range of generated values.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());int accountID = random.nextInt();
```
