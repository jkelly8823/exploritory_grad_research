VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential vulnerability to certificate verification bypass and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be handling SSL/TLS peer certificate verification. However, it only checks for two specific return codes from the `SSL_get_verify_result` function: `X509_V_OK` and `X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`. This is a narrow set of conditions, and other potential issues might not be caught. The certificate could still be invalid or not trusted, yet the code would not detect these problems.

More specifically, this code does not verify the peer certificate against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), compare the common name in the certificate to the requested hostname, or check for revocation status. A malicious party could intercept and respond with an invalid or untrusted certificate, and the code might still consider it valid if it satisfies one of the two specified conditions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
For proper peer certificate verification, you should perform the following:
1. Compare the peer certificate to a trusted CA or its issuance certificate.
2. Check the revocation status of the peer certificate using CRL (Certificate Revocation List) or OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol).
3. Verify that the peer certificate's common name matches the requested hostname.
4. Implement certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks by specifying a specific certificate or public key.

By doing so, you can significantly improve the security of your code's certificate verification logic.

ORIGINAL CODE:
if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host)foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))
    // certificate looks good, host can be trusted
