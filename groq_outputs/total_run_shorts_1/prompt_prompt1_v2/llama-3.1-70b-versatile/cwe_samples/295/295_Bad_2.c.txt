VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Possible assignment instead of comparison in conditional statement.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet uses a single equals sign (=) in the if statement condition, which can lead to an assignment instead of a comparison. The intention is likely to compare the result of SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) with cert, but the actual code assigns the result to cert. This can potentially lead to a vulnerability if the assignment always evaluates to a truthy value, causing the code inside the if statement to be executed regardless of the original intention.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, replace the single equals sign (=) with a double equals sign (==) for comparison, ensuring that the condition is evaluated correctly. The corrected line should be:

```c
if (cert == SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)))
```

Additionally, consider using more explicit typing and declaring variables before using them. Given the limits of the snippet, this specific case cannot be fixed but in the complete code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))

        //do stuff
        
        //Note this is simply for illustration
        //you could actually be doing something critical here

    // stuff continues here
```

Also consider splitting the line in multiple lines or blocks of more clear code in order to enhance readability.
