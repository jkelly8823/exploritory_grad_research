VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and a potential credentials exposure.
EXPLANATION:
The code broadcasts an intent with the user's username and password as extras. This could lead to a MITM attack, where an attacker with the necessary permissions could intercept this intent and obtain the sensitive credentials. Furthermore, this approach is insecure as it directly exposes sensitive information, such as passwords, in plain text. In addition, storing and transmitting passwords in plaintext is a serious security risk. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Secure the transmission of credentials by using more secure methods such as HTTP(S) requests to a server that is hosted on a secure domain. It's also crucial to hash and salt passwords when they're stored and not store them in plaintext. To further mitigate these risks, ensure that any intent receivers are properly validated using techniques such as permission checks and signature-level permissions. Use HTTPS when sending data over a network, to prevent eavesdropping.
Using an encryption algorithm might also be necessary in order to provide maximum security to protect sensitive credentials.
ORIGINAL CODE:
 Intent intent = new Intent();intent.setAction("com.example.CreateUser");intent.putExtra("Username", uname_string);intent.putExtra("Password", pw_string);sendBroadcast(intent);
