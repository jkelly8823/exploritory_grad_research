VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to Intent Hijacking due to its use of implicit IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and granting the target application permission to access sensitive data.
EXPLANATION:
The code uses an implicit intent with the action "com.example.BackupUserData", which is broadcast to any application that has declared an intent filter matching this action. The code also grants the target application permission to access the data stored at the URI specified by `file_uri`. However, this permission grant is done without checking whether the target application is actually the intended recipient, opening up the possibility of malicious applications intercepting and exploiting this intent. This could allow malicious applications to read sensitive data from the URI.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that the intent be made explicit by specifying the exact package name and class of the target application. This can be done using the `setClassName()` or `setClass()` methods of the `Intent` class. Additionally, application developers should consider using Signature Permission Protection or Manifest Protection to ensure that only trusted applications can receive and process the intent.
ORIGINAL CODE:
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction("com.example.BackupUserData");
intent.setData(file_uri);
intent.addFlags(FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
sendBroadcast(intent);
