VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `uri` variable is first set to user-controlled data (the `_uri` script object) in the `setup` method, and then used to send a request in the `send` method. This allows an attacker to potentially control the request URL, which could lead to SSRF. Furthermore, the `uri` is also used to get credentials, which could be leveraged by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack.

Additionally, the `coerceToString` function is used to convert user-controlled data into a string, which could lead to further vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we need to validate and sanitize the `uri` variable to prevent SSRF and CSRF attacks.

1. Validate the `uri` variable to ensure it only contains trusted URLs.
2. Use a whitelist of allowed URLs to prevent SSRF attacks.
3. Add CSRF protection measures, such as a token-based validation, to prevent CSRF attacks.
4. Consider using a more secure way of handling user-controlled data, such as using prepared statements or escaping special characters.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
class Request{
    private:
        std::string uri;
        /* ... */
    public:
        void setup(ScriptObject* _uri){
            this->uri = scriptEngine->coerceToString(_uri);
            /* ... */
        }
        void send(ScriptObject* _data){
            Credentials credentials = GetCredentials(uri);
            std::string data = scriptEngine->coerceToString(_data);
            doSend(uri, credentials, data);
        }
}
```
