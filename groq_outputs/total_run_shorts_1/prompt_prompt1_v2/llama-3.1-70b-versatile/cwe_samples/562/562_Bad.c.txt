VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
 Return of a local variable by pointer.

EXPLANATION:
The code defines a function `getName()` that declares a local character array `name` with a size of `STR_MAX`. It then calls `fillInName(name)` to populate this array and returns a pointer to the array. However, since `name` is a local variable, its memory is allocated on the stack, and once the function returns, this memory is no longer valid. By returning a pointer to a local variable, the function is exposing potentially invalid memory to the caller.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function should allocate memory for the name on the heap using `malloc` or a similar function. The recommended fix would be to allocate memory for the name and return this allocated memory. Additionally, it would be a good practice to ensure the allocated memory is freed when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Here's an example of the corrected function:

```
char* getName() {
    char* name = malloc(sizeof(char) * (STR_MAX + 1));
    fillInName(name);
    return name;
}
```
Note that the caller should be responsible for freeing this memory when it's no longer needed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
char* getName() {char name[STR_MAX];fillInName(name);return name;}
