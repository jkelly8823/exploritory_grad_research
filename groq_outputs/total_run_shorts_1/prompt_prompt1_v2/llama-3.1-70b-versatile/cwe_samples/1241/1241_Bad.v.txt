VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to data corruption due to the lack of synchronization between the calculation of 'in_sr' and its assignment to an output.

EXPLANATION:
The always block is sensitive to all variables, but does not actually read any of the input signals. It does, however, assignment to an output variable 'in_sr' based on current values of input signals. The block may execute multiple times before any output values are actually used. The issue arises as in_sr is constantly changing, making it highly likely that in_sr received will be incorrect or unstable.

Additionally, it appears as if an XOR calculation of multiple signals has been set, then 'in_sr' is fed into an entropy generator. Lack of control to see actual results, due to so many other outside factors playing into entropy16_o, may cause problems according to specific requirements set.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use non-blocking assignments (<=) to ensure that assignment of 'in_sr' is delayed until the next time step. 

The always block in this case, given no signal is noted for sensitivity should be changed to 
'always @(posedge clk) '  assuming 'clk' is the valid state's signal that is defined for the output signals, like 'entropy16_valid_o'.
