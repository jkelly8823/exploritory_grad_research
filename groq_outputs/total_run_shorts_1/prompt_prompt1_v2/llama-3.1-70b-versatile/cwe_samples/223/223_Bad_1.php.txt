VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code is vulnerable to a file inclusion vulnerability and path traversal attack. The `readFile` function does not properly sanitize or validate the input filename before passing it to various file-related functions, potentially allowing an attacker to access files and directories that they should not have access to.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the input filename is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in various file-related functions. An attacker could potentially manipulate the filename to perform a path traversal attack, allowing them to access sensitive files and directories outside of the intended scope of the application.

Additionally, the use of `fileowner` function and checking if the current user has ownership of the file does not prevent a malicious user from reading sensitive files, as it can be easily bypassed by an attacker who has the necessary privileges to create symbolic links to sensitive files.

The function also does not handle cases where the file does not exist or is not readable, potentially leading to further security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should:

1. Implement strict validation and sanitization on the input filename to ensure it only contains expected and safe characters.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow access to specific, pre-approved files and directories.
3. Avoid using user input to construct file paths directly.
4. Consider using a secure file inclusion mechanism, such as using a centralized file repository or a Content Security Policy (CSP).
5. Validate the file existence and readability before attempting to access its contents.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function readFile($filename){
    $user = getCurrentUser();$realFile = $filename;
    
    //resolve file if its a symbolic link
    if(is_link($filename)){$realFile = readlink($filename);}
    if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));}
}
```
