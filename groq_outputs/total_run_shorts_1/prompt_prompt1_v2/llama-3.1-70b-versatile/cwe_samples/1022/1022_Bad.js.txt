VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Window Injection Vulnerability (also known as Unintended Pop-up Vulnerability)

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability occurs when an application opens a new, trusted window on a user's client without proper validation. The opened window may contain malicious content from an untrusted source, potentially injecting malicious scripts into the user's trusted context, leading to various types of attacks, such as phishing or cross-site scripting (XSS).

In the given code, a new window is opened with an untrusted URL ("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html"), allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious content into the trusted context. The vulnerability arises from the absence of validation on the URL being passed to the window.open() function.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability:

- Use the 'noopener' or '_self' attribute instead of '_blank' to maintain the same origin and avoid losing control over the newly opened window.
- Ensure the URL being passed to the window.open() function is validated and properly sanitized, checking for potential tampering or malicious content.
- Prefer opening new windows with URLs from trusted origins to avoid potential security risks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  var newWindow = window.open("http://attacker-site.example.com/useful-page.html", "_blank");
