VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Denial of Service (DoS) via regex Catastrophic Backtracking

EXPLANATION:
The provided regular expression `^(\w+\s?)*$` is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to catastrophic backtracking. This occurs when the regex engine attempts to match a large number of possible permutations, causing it to consume excessive CPU resources. In this case, the `\w+` pattern (which matches one or more word characters) is followed by a `\s?` pattern (which matches zero or one whitespace characters). The repetition (`*`) of this pattern allows for numerous possible matches, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing strings containing large numbers of word characters or whitespace.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the regular expression to avoid catastrophic backtracking. This can be achieved by making the repeating pattern more specific or by using a negation instead of a repetition. For example, you could use `^\w+(?:\s\w+)*$` to allow for only one or more whitespace characters between word characters.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
               var test_string = "Bad characters: $@#";
               var bad_pattern  = /^(\w+\s?)*$/i;
               var result = test_string.search(bad_pattern);
```
