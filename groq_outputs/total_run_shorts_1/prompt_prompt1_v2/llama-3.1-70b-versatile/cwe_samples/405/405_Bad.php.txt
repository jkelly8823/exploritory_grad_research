VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4, 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given code snippet contains a vulnerability related to an arbitrary file read, which can lead to information disclosure and potentially other security issues.

EXPLANATION:
The function `printFile` takes a `$username` and a `$filename` as parameters. It attempts to read the contents of the specified file using `file_get_contents`. However, it does not perform any validation or sanitization on the `$filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file that is accessible by the server's PHP process. This includes sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, configuration files containing database credentials, or other sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the `$filename` parameter should be strictly validated and sanitized to ensure it adheres to a specific format or directory path. Consider using a whitelist approach, where you only allow files from a specific directory or with a specific extension. Additionally, the usage of `file_get_contents` should be considered insecure if the filename can be manipulated. A safer approach might be to use `SplFileObject` or `fopen` and manually validate the file handle.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);
    if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){
        echo $file;
        return true;
    }else{
        echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';
    }
    return false;
}
```
