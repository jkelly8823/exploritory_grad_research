VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `strcpy` function, which does not perform any bounds checking on the destination buffer. The `strstr` function is used to find the location of the string "Replace Me" in the `destBuf`, and then the result is used to calculate the index `idx`. However, the `strcpy` function is then used to copy the contents of `srcBuf` to the `destBuf` starting at the calculated index, without checking whether the `srcBuf` will fit in the remaining space in the `destBuf`. If the length of `srcBuf` is greater than the remaining space in `destBuf`, it will overflow the buffer, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, you can use a safer version of `strcpy`, such as `strncpy`, which allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, thus preventing buffer overflows. However, you should still check whether the `srcBuf` will fit in the remaining space in the `destBuf` before copying. You can do this by comparing the length of `srcBuf` with the remaining space in `destBuf`. Additionally, you should also check for null-termination errors by ensuring that the destination buffer has enough space to accommodate the null-terminating character.

Here's an example of how you can modify the code to fix the vulnerability:

```c
int main() {
  ...
  char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
  int idx = result - destBuf;
  size_t destinationSize = sizeof(destBuf) - idx - 1; // assuming destBuf is a char array
  strncpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf, destinationSize);
  destBuf[idx + destinationSize] = '\0'; // ensure null-termination
  ...
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
  ...
  char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
  int idx = result - destBuf;
  strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
  ...
}
```
