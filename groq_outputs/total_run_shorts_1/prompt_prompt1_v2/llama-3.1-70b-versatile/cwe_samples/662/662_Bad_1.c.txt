VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Path Traversal and Null Pointer Dereference vulnerabilities due to a lack of bounds checking and null checking on user-controlled input (the 'string' pointer).

EXPLANATION: 
The `print` function lacks input validation and bounds checking. It assumes that the input string will always be null-terminated, which is not guaranteed. The function does not check if the input string is null before dereferencing it, which could lead to a null pointer dereference. Additionally, the loop iterates over each byte in the string without checking for null characters or non-printable characters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious data. 

Moreover, there's a potential buffer overflow when passing a string to `putc` with `counter` variable which is assigned the value of `*word++`. `putc` function will interpret the passed value as a single character, if the value of `counter` exceeds the ASCII value of the character to be printed, which will result in printing an undefined character.  

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the function should check for null pointers before dereferencing them. The input string should also be checked for null-termination and its bounds should be validated before copying or processing it. Additionally, checks should be added to ensure the string contains only printable ASCII characters before passing it to `putc`. 

Here's an example of how the `print` function could be modified to add these checks:

```c
static void print (char * string) {
    if (string == NULL || *string == '\0') {
        return;
    }

    for (int i = 0; string[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (string[i] >= 32 && string[i] <= 126) {
            putc(string[i], stdout);
            fflush(stdout);
            sleep(1);
        }
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static void print (char * string) {
    char * word;int counter;for (word = string; counter = *word++; ) {
        putc(counter, stdout);fflush(stdout);
        /* Make timing window a little larger... */
        sleep(1);
    }
}
int main(void) {
    pid_t pid;
    pid = fork();if (pid == -1) {exit(-2);}else if (pid == 0) {print("child\n");}else {print("PARENT\n");}exit(0);
}
```
