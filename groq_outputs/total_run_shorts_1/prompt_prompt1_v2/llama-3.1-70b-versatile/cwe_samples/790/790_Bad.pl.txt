VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. Although the code attempts to sanitize the user input by removing '../' sequences, it does not prevent other forms of path manipulation. This is because the sanitization is incomplete and does not account for other directory traversal sequences that can be used to bypass the filter. Additionally, the code combines user input directly with a file path, allowing an attacker to potentially access and read arbitrary files on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more comprehensive sanitization approach and avoid combining user input directly with file paths. Specifically:
- Instead of removing '../' sequences, use a whitelist-based approach to validate and normalize the input username.
- Use a secure method to combine the input with the base file path, such as using a secure file system API or a framework-provided function for handling file paths.
- Consider using a secure file path manipulation library to handle these cases.
- Additionally, ensure that the ReadAndSendFile function is designed to handle cases where the file does not exist or cannot be read.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
