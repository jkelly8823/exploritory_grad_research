VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a hardcoded HMAC key.

EXPLANATION:
The HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code) key is hardcoded directly into the code. Hardcoding sensitive information like cryptographic keys directly into the code poses a significant security risk. This vulnerability is known as "Hardcoded Sensitive Data." An attacker who gains access to the code can easily extract the HMAC key, potentially allowing them to forge HMAC-based authentication messages and bypass security controls.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

- Store sensitive information like HMAC keys securely in a secure keystore or an environment variable.
- Use a secure method to load the HMAC key into the application, such as through a secure configuration file or a trusted API call.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code.
- Consider using a secure random number generator to generate the HMAC key, and store it securely.
