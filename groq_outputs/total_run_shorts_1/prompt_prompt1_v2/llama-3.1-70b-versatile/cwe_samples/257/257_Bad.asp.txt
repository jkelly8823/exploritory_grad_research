VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a hardcoded database password, which is a significant security risk.

EXPLANATION:
The code includes a connection string with a hardcoded password ("pwd=password;"). Hardcoding passwords in configuration files is a serious security vulnerability. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database if the code is compromised or accessed by an unauthorized person.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use environment variables or a secure configuration storage mechanism to store the password.
2. Consider using a more secure authentication method, such as integrated authentication or encryption certificates.
3. If using a plain text password is unavoidable, consider obfuscating or encrypting the password in the configuration file.
4. Limit permissions of the database user account to the necessary minimum required for the application to function.
5. Rotate and update the password regularly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
...<connectionStrings><add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" /></connectionStrings>...
