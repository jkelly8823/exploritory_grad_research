VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow and Authentication Weakness Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it directly passes user input (`password`) to a function (`compress`) without checking its length or bounds. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the input is longer than expected. Additionally, using `strcmp` for authentication can be insecure because it is a deterministic function. A more secure approach would be to use a timing-safe comparison function.

Furthermore, storing and verifying passwords using compression instead of proper hashing is a security risk. It makes it easy for an attacker to obtain the original password by reversing the compression algorithm.

The code also lacks proper error handling for the `compress` and `strcmp` functions, which can lead to more vulnerabilities if these functions fail.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these vulnerabilities, consider the following modifications:

1. Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the `compress` function to prevent buffer overflows.
2. Use a secure, non-deterministic comparison function for authentication.
3. Use proper password hashing and verification (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) rather than compression.
4. Implement proper error handling for the `compress` and `strcmp` functions.
5. Consider using a safer, more secure function for authentication (e.g., `strncmp` with a fixed length).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
  if (strcmp(compress(password), compressed_password)) {
    printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
    return(0);
  }
  printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
  return(1);
}
```
