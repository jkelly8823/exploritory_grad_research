VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Sensitive Data in Properties File

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file. The presence of hardcoded, sensitive information (i.e., 'secretUsername' and 'secretPassword') poses a serious security threat. This type of information should never be checked into version control or stored in clear text.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Environment variables: Store sensitive data as environment variables. 
2. External secure storage: Consider using external services that securely store sensitive information.
3. Placeholder properties: Replace sensitive data with placeholder properties files. This approach is especially useful for local development testing.
4. Use of Configuration Management Tools: Explore the use of configuration management tools to securely inject sensitive values into application context.
5. Remove hardcoded values: Remove or redact sensitive information to disallow unwanted exposure.
