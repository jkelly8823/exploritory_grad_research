VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet stores a database password in plain text, making it a potential security vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The connection string in this code snippet contains a password in plain text, which could expose the database to unauthorized access. This is because connection strings are typically stored in configuration files that may be accessed by unauthorized users or exposed through various means. Hardcoding passwords in source code or configuration files is considered insecure because it provides an easy target for attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to store sensitive information like database passwords securely using a secrets management system or environment variables. Environment variables should not be hardcoded in the source code and should be set separately in each environment (development, testing, production). In a production environment, environment variables can be set as part of the deployment process or using a configuration management tool.

A good practice is to separate sensitive information from non-sensitive information, and store it in a secure manner. Some ways to store sensitive information securely include:

* Using an environment variable
* Storing the connection string in an encrypted file
* Using a secret manager like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" />
</connectionStrings>
