VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
LDAP Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks. This occurs when user-provided input is directly embedded into the LDAP search filter without proper sanitization or escaping. In this case, the `address` variable is concatenated into the `searchFilter` string, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious LDAP queries. An attacker could manipulate the `address` variable to inject arbitrary LDAP filters, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or disruption of the LDAP service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent LDAP injection attacks, it is recommended to escape or encode user-provided input before using it in LDAP queries. In this case, you can use the `javax.naming.directory.StringFilter` class to create a safe LDAP filter. Alternatively, you can use parameterized queries, where the input is treated as a value, rather than part of the query.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to use `StringFilter`:
```java
import javax.naming.directory.StringFilter;

// ...

StringFilter sf = new StringFilter("StreetAddress=%v", address);
NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, sf, searchCtls);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
context = new InitialDirContext(env);String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address;NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);
```
