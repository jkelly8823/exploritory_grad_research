VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 SQL Injection / XPath Injection Vulnerability via User-Controlled Input
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to XPath injection. The `login.getUserName()` and `login.getPassword()` values are directly concatenated into the XPath expression `xlogin`. An attacker could potentially inject malicious XPath expressions by manipulating the `login.getUserName()` and `login.getPassword()` values. This could allow the attacker to access unauthorized data or disrupt the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use XPath variables to avoid directly concatenating user-controlled input into the XPath expression. XPath 1.0 does not have native support for variables, but some libraries or implementations may provide a way to do this. Alternatively, you can use a whitelisting approach to validate and sanitize the user input data before using it in the XPath expression. You should also consider using parameterized XPath queries or libraries that support query parameterization.

ORIGINAL CODE:
XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
XPathExpression xlogin = xpath.compile("//users/user[login/text() = '" + login.getUserName() + "' and password/text() = '" + login.getPassword() + "']/home_dir/text()");
Document d = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(new File("db.xml"));
String homedir = xlogin.evaluate(d);
