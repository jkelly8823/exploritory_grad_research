VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Stack Overflow due to excessive alloca usage

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability in this code is the use of `alloca` within a loop, allocating memory on the stack without freeing it. This can lead to a stack overflow, especially if `end_limit` is large. `alloca` allocates memory on the stack, and this memory is automatically released when the function returns. However, in this case, memory is being allocated in a loop, and this can quickly exceed the maximum stack size. Furthermore, the `p = *p;` line introduces an additional stack address into the calculation, which is likely an error and further exacerbates the problem.

Also, `alloca` is used with `sizeof(int *)` which returns a pointer size (usually 4 or 8 bytes), not an integer size. This makes it unclear what is intended to be stored at the allocated memory location.

Additionally, `base` is initially set to `NULL`, but no check is performed before dereferencing `p` (which is initially `base`). This results in dereferencing a `NULL` pointer on the first iteration of the loop, causing undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix for this code would be to use dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `malloc` or `calloc`) instead of `alloca` to allocate memory on the heap rather than on the stack. It's also recommended to perform a check for `NULL` before dereferencing any pointer. Here's an example of the fixed code:

```c
int end_limit = get_nmbr_obj_from_db();
int i;
int **base = NULL;  // int ** for array of pointers
base = malloc(end_limit * sizeof(int *));
if (!base) {
    // handle memory allocation failure
}

for (i = 0; i < end_limit; i++) {
    base[i] = malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (!base[i]) {
        // handle memory allocation failure
    }
    // You can now safely use base[i] as a pointer to an integer
}

```
It's also important to remember to free the allocated memory when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
// Gets the size from the number of objects in a database, which over time can conceivably get very large
int end_limit = get_nmbr_obj_from_db();
int i;
int *base = NULL;
int *p = base;
for (i = 0; i < end_limit; i++)
{
    *p = alloca(sizeof(int *)); // Allocate memory on the stack
    p = *p; // // Point to the next location to be saved
}
```
