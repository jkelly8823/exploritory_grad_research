VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a vulnerability where untrusted intent data is used to perform sensitive operations, potentially allowing for data tampering or unauthorized data deletion.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet registers a BroadcastReceiver that listens for intents with the action "com.example.RemoveUser". When such an intent is received, the BroadcastReceiver extracts a user ID from the intent and calls the `destroyUserData` method with that ID. However, the intent data comes from an untrusted source, as it can be generated by any app on the device that knows the specific intent action. An attacker can potentially send a malicious intent with a manipulated user ID to initiate deletion of sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the intent data: Verify that the intent data, specifically the user ID, is valid and comes from a trusted source before performing any operations with that data.
2. Use more specific intent actions: Instead of using a simple string for the intent action, use a URI that is less guessable and more specific, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized apps sending the intent.
3. Enforce permissions: Require permissions for sending and receiving the intent, and restrict the permissions to apps that have been granted access to sensitive data.
4. Verify the sender: Check the package name of the app that sent the intent and ensure it is from a trusted source.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
registerReceiver(receiver, filter);

public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
    destroyUserData(userID);
}
```
