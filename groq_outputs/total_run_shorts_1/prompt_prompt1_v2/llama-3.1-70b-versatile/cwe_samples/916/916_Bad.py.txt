VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to insecure password hashing.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to store passwords. MD5 is a broken hashing algorithm that is not suitable for password storage. It is vulnerable to collisions and can be easily brute-forced using dedicated hardware. Furthermore, the code does not use a salt, which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using a more secure password hashing algorithm such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks. Additionally, a salt should be used to make the hashed passwords unique and more resistant to rainbow table attacks.

Here is an example of how to use PBKDF2 for password hashing:

```python
import hashlib
import os
import binascii

def storePassword(userName, Password):
    salt = os.urandom(32)
    key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', Password.encode('utf-8'), salt, 100000)
    hashedPassword = binascii.hexlify(salt) + binascii.hexlify(key)
    
    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
    return updateUserLogin(userName, hashedPassword)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                        # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                        return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
