VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet uses MD5 hashing for password storage, which is insecure. Additionally, it uses a fixed salt and stores the hashed password directly.

EXPLANATION:
MD5 hashing is widely considered to be insecure for password storage due to its speed, which can lead to brute force attacks. A fixed salt is also insecure as it can lead to rainbow table attacks. Storing the hashed password directly can also lead to potential security issues if it's intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties. Furthermore, the hashed password is directly updated to `updateUserLogin` function without any further checks or handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To securely store passwords, consider using a strong hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2. Use a unique, randomly generated salt for each user and store it along with the hashed password. When storing passwords, consider using a library that provides secure password storage, such as passlib or cryptography in Python. Here is an example using bcrypt:

```python
import bcrypt

def storePassword(userName, Password):
    # Generate a random salt using bcrypt
    hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashpw(Password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    # Do not directly store unicode object, keep it as bytes.
    return updateUserLogin(userName, hashedPassword)
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```
def storePassword(userName,Password):hasher = hashlib.new('md5',b'SaltGoesHere')hasher.update(Password)hashedPassword = hasher.digest()
                    
                    # UpdateUserLogin returns True on success, False otherwise
                    return updateUserLogin(userName,hashedPassword)
                  
```
