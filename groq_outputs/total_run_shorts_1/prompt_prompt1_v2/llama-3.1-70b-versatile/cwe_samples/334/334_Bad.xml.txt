VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A vulnerability exists due to the use of an insecure session ID length. Session IDs with a length of 8 bytes (i.e., 64 bits) are vulnerable to collision attacks and can be guessed or bruteforced.

EXPLANATION:
A session ID with a length of 8 bytes is considerable weak. The Birthday Problem states that for a random function, after generating 2^(n/2) unique inputs, there is a high probability of a collision (i.e., two identical outputs). Since 2^32 = 4,294,967,296, an attacker would only need to generate 2^32 (i.e., approximately 4 billion) unique session IDs to have a high probability of guessing an existing ID. This can be achieved using modern computing power and is particularly feasible if the session ID generation is predictable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, increase the session ID length to at least 16 bytes (128 bits) or higher. It is also recommended to use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the session ID. 

Here's an example of how to configure a more secure session ID length:

```xml
<property name="idLengthBytes" value="16">
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```xml
<sun-web-app>
    ...<session-config>
        <session-properties>
            <property name="idLengthBytes" value="8">
                <description>The number of bytes in this web module's session ID.</description>
            </property>
        </session-properties>
    </session-config>
    ...
</sun-web-app>
