VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Memory leaks and potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, two issues are identified. The first issue is with the allocation and deallocation of memory. The function `trimTrailingWhitespace` allocates memory for the `message` variable using `malloc`, but it does not free this memory before returning. This can cause a memory leak if the function is called repeatedly.

The second issue is with the use of `sizeof(char)*(length+1)` for memory allocation. If the input `length` is not validated to be within a reasonable range, it can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Additionally, there is a possible buffer overflow when copying the input string to the `message` variable. If the input string's length is larger than the allocated memory for `message`, it can cause undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Free the allocated memory for `message` before returning from the function to prevent memory leaks. Alternatively, use a standard container or string class that manages memory for you.
2. Validate the input `length` to ensure it is within a reasonable range and does not exceed the maximum allowed value to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
3. Use a safer way to copy the input string to `message`, such as using `strncpy` or `strcpy_s` with a clear limit on the number of characters to copy.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char* trimTrailingWhitespace(char *strMessage, int length) {
     char *retMessage;char *message = malloc(sizeof(char)*(length+1));
        
     // copy input string to a temporary string
     char message[length+1];int index;for (index = 0; index < length; index++) {message[index] = strMessage[index];}message[index] = '\0';
        
     // trim trailing whitespace
     int len = index-1;while (isspace(message[len])) {message[len] = '\0';len--;}
        
     // return string without trailing whitespace
     retMessage = message;return retMessage;
}
```
