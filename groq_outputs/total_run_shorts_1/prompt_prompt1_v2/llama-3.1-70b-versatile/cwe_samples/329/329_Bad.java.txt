VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (note: vulnerability spans across multiple lines and concepts, rather than specific lines of code)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet uses the DES encryption algorithm, which is insecure and has been deprecated for several years.

EXPLANATION:
The DES algorithm has been widely considered insecure for several years due to its small key size (56 bits), which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. In 1999, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) demonstrated a machine that could crack DES encryption in under a day. Furthermore, the DES algorithm is not designed to be resistant to certain attacks, such as differential cryptanalysis. The usage of DES in this code snippet is a significant security vulnerability.

Additionally, the code snippet uses the "Secret".getBytes() method to create a byte array from a string. However, this method uses the default charset of the system, which can lead to unpredictable results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Replace the DES algorithm with a more secure and modern encryption algorithm, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). AES is widely considered to be secure and has been extensively tested and validated by the cryptographic community.

Replace the line `KeyGenerator kg = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");kg.init(56);` with something like `KeyGenerator kg = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");kg.init(256);`

Replace the line `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");` with something like `Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");`

Also, consider using a secure method to create the byte array from the input string, such as using the `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` charset.

Consider using a secure way to generate a random initialization vector (IV) instead of hardcoding it.

Consider using a secure way to handle key management, such as generating a new key for each encryption operation and securely storing the key.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class SymmetricCipherTest {
    public static void main() {
        
        byte[] text = "Secret".getBytes();
        byte[] iv = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
        KeyGenerator kg = KeyGenerator.getInstance("DES");
        kg.init(56);
        SecretKey key = kg.generateKey();
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
        IvParameterSpec ips = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, ips);
        return cipher.doFinal(inpBytes);
    }
}
