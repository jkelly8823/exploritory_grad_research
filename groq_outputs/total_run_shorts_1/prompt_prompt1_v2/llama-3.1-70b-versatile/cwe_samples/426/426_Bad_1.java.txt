VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet calls `System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make")`, which executes a system command. The command is hardcoded to "make", but in a real-world scenario, the command might be dynamically generated or user-controlled. If an attacker can inject malicious commands into the exec method, they can execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to command injection attacks. In this specific case, since "make" is hardcoded, the vulnerability depends on the program allowing users to input data that can cause unintended commands to be run or files modified indirectly via dependencies of 'make'.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider validating and sanitizing user input data before using it to construct system commands. Instead of using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, use `ProcessBuilder` which provides more control over the execution of the command and reduces the risk of command injection attacks. Alternatively, consider using a library that provides a more secure way to execute system commands.
ORIGINAL CODE:
System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");
