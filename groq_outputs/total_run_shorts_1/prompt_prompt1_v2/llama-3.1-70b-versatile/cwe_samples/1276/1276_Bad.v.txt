VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a constant assignment of a security level to an IP module, effectively disabling its security feature.

EXPLANATION:
The IP module "tz_peripheral" has a security feature controlled by the "data_in_security_level" input, which determines whether incoming data is secure or non-secure. However, in the instantiation of the IP module, the security level is hardcoded to 0 (secure) with the statement `.data_in_security_level(1'b0)`. This could be a copy-and-paste error or a typo, but it effectively disables the security feature by always marking data as secure, regardless of its actual security level.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the security level should be dynamically controlled based on the actual security level of the incoming data. One possible solution is to connect the `data_in_security_level` input to a variable or signal that reflects the actual security level, rather than hardcoding a constant value.

```verilog
// Instantiation of IP in a parent system
module soc(...)
    ...
    input [31:0] secure_data_in;
    input security_level;
    ...
    tz_peripheral u_tz_peripheral(
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .data_in(secure_data_in),
        // Dynamically set data_in_security_level based on security_level
        .data_in_security_level(security_level),
    );
    ...
endmodule
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
// IP definition
module tz_peripheral(clk, reset, data_in, data_in_security_level, ...);

input clk, reset;
input [31:0] data_in;
input data_in_security_level;
...
      
endmodule
// Instantiation of IP in a parent system
module soc(...)

...
tz_peripheral u_tz_peripheral(
  
  .clk(clk),
  .rst(rst),
  .data_in(rdata),
  // Copy-and-paste error or typo grounds data_in_security_level (in this example 0=secure, 1=non-secure) effectively promoting all data to "secure")
  .data_in_security_level(1'b0),

);
...
      
endmodule
```
