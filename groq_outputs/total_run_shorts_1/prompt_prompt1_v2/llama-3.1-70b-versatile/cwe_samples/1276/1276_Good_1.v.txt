VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4,6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated User Input via Direct Assignment
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet assigns user-input variables `irq_i` and `time_irq_i` directly to the `csr_regfile_i` module without performing any validation or sanitization checks. This practice can lead to uncontrolled data flows, potentially causing unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities if these inputs originate from an untrusted source.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Secure coding practices recommend implementing input validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent potential security risks. To address this vulnerability, consider adding checks or filters to validate `irq_i` and `time_irq_i` before passing them to `csr_regfile_i`. This could involve checking for acceptable value ranges or formats to prevent malicious or erroneous input from affecting the system's behavior.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```verilog
csr_regfile #(
    //...
) csr_regfile_i (
    //.flush_o             ( flush_csr_ctrl ),
    .flush_o             ( flush_csr_ctrl ),
    .halt_csr_o          ( halt_csr_ctrl ),
    //...
    .irq_i            (irq_i),
    .time_irq_i       (time_irq_i),
    .*
);
//...
