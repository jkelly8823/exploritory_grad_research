VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential input validation vulnerability related to the `rdata_security_level` input port.

EXPLANATION:
The `rdata_security_level` input port is driven by an external signal, which may not be validated or sanitized before being used to determine the security level of the input data. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the security level of the input data, leading to unauthorized access or data corruption. 

Additionally, the fact that this port was previously grounded suggests a recent change to the system's behavior, which may not have been thoroughly reviewed or tested for security implications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. Validate and sanitize the `rdata_security_level` input signal to ensure it is within an expected and secure range.
2. Implement additional security checks and controls to prevent unauthorized access or data corruption based on the `rdata_security_level` value.
3. Review the system's documentation and configuration to ensure that the change to the `rdata_security_level` input port is properly documented and meets the system's security requirements.
4. Consider adding additional logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security incidents related to the `rdata_security_level` input port.
