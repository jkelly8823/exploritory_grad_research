VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential information disclosure vulnerability due to the use of customErrors mode "On" with a static default redirect page.

EXPLANATION:
The use of customErrors mode "On" with a static default redirect page may allow an attacker to identify the technology stack or other environmental details about the application or server. This can potentially facilitate further attacks. However, since the customErrors mode is set to "On", the application will still suppress the full error messages and not reveal detailed information about the server or stack in the error messages.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to set customErrors mode to "On" with a dynamic redirect page that does not reveal any potentially sensitive information about the server or technology stack. It is also necessary to ensure that the error handling mechanism correctly catches and handles all types of errors to prevent any information leakage.

However, based on the given context (only a small code snippet is provided), we cannot identify what type of information might be revealed by the redirect page 'YourErrorPage.htm'. Therefore, it is recommended to review 'YourErrorPage.htm' and any associated files for any potential vulnerabilities or disclosure of environment-specific information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" />
