VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Error Handling due to Information Exposure

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet captures an `ApplicationSpecificException` and logs its details by calling `ase.toString()`. This approach is insecure because it can inadvertently expose sensitive information about the application's internal state or its dependencies. In certain scenarios, this information could be exploited by malicious entities to launch targeted attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this issue, the code should log a sanitized message that doesn't expose sensitive information. It is recommended to log a static message or pass predetermined, non-sensitive exception details (e.g., an error code and a fixed string). You can also consider implementing a more sophisticated error handling strategy that takes into account the type of exception being caught and provides more informative error messages without compromising security.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {try {...} catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());}}
