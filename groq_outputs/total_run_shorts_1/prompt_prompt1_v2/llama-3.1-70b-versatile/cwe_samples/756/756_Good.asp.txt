VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Custom Error Configuration

EXPLANATION:
The custom error configuration mode is set to "RemoteOnly". This setting allows detailed error messages to be displayed on remote servers but hides them on local servers. However, in a production environment, this can still pose a security risk. If the server is accessed remotely by an attacker and it encounters an error, it will display detailed error information that could potentially be used to exploit vulnerabilities. It is recommended to set this configuration to "On" to always display custom error messages, rather than detailed error information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Change the custom error configuration mode to "On" and ensure that it is set to display only generic error information. Additionally, consider logging and monitoring error messages on the server-side to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed.
