VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Hardcoded Database Credentials

EXPLANATION:
 The provided PHP code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, specifically the database name and password. Storing sensitive information such as database credentials directly within the codebase poses a significant security risk. If an attacker gains access to the code, they will also obtain the database credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized data access and malicious activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 It is strongly recommended to store sensitive information, such as database credentials, in a secure manner using environment variables or a secrets management system. This approach allows you to separate sensitive data from the codebase and provides an additional layer of security.

 To address this vulnerability, consider the following:

 * Define a secure configuration file or environment file that stores database credentials, and load this file at runtime.
 * Use environment variables or a secrets management system to store sensitive information.
 * Limit access to sensitive data by using access controls, encryption, and secure authentication mechanisms.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
$dbName = 'usersDB';
$dbPassword = 'skjdh#67nkjd3$3$';
?>
```
