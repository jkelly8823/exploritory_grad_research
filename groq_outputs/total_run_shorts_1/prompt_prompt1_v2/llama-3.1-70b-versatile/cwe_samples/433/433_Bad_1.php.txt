VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure authentication mechanism.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be authenticating a user by calling the `$db.authenticateUser()` method, passing the `$username` and `$password` variables directly. This suggests that the password is being stored in plaintext, which is a significant security risk. Additionally, there is no indication that the password is being hashed or verified securely. This may lead to potential vulnerabilities such as password disclosure, brute-force attacks, or credential stuffing.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to store passwords securely by hashing them with a strong password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt or Argon2. When authenticating a user, compare the stored hashed password with a hashed version of the provided password. This can be achieved by using a secure password comparison function. Also, ensure that the password storage process includes a salt value to prevent rainbow table attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
<?php
include('database.inc');
$db = connectToDB($dbName, $dbPassword);
$db.authenticateUser($username, $password);
?>
```
