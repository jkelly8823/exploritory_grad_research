VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `readFile` function checks the ownership of the file using `fileowner($filename)` before reading its contents using `file_get_contents($realFile)`. However, the check is performed before the actual read operation. An attacker could potentially exploit this by changing the file's ownership or the file itself after the ownership check, but before the read operation. This could lead to unauthorized access to files.

Moreover, the function assumes that `$realFile` is a defined variable, but `$realFile` is not defined in the provided code snippet. It seems that the correct variable name should be `$filename`.

Additionally, the function does not perform any error handling for the file operations. If an error occurs during file reading or ownership checking, the function may behave unexpectedly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use atomic operations or ensure that the file is not accessible to untrusted users during the execution of the function.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent any unexpected behavior.
- Perform error handling for file operations.
- Use the correct variable name (`$filename`) instead of `$realFile`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function readFile($filename){
     $user = getCurrentUser();
       
       //resolve file if its a symbolic link
       if(is_link($filename)){$filename = readlink($filename);}
       if(fileowner($filename) == $user){echo file_get_contents($realFile);return;}else{echo 'Access denied';return false;}
 }
```
Note: The variable declaration for `$realFile` is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the context, it seems that the correct variable name should be `$filename`.
