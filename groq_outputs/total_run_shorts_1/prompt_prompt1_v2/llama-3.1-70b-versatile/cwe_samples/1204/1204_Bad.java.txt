VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 
Original code had no line numbers. However the locations of the vulnerability can be identified as the  uses of DES and DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code uses the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for encryption. Despite being a standard, DES has been extensively cryptanalyzed and is now considered insecure for many applications.

EXPLANATION:
Although DES was an important standard in the past, it has been largely replaced by more secure algorithms like AES. DES is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to its limited key size. In particular, the key size used in this code is only 56 bits, making it even more susceptible to being broken.

Additionally, the key is being generated randomly every time, which can lead to key management issues. Furthermore, DES is being used with CBC mode, which, while more secure than ECB mode, can still be vulnerable to certain attacks if not used correctly. The code is also missing any form of authentication (such as HMAC), which makes it vulnerable to tampering attacks.

The initialization vector is also a constant, which makes the starting condition of each encryption and decryption process predictable. 

Finally, the code is returning the result of `cipher.doFinal(inpBytes)` but `inpBytes` is not defined anywhere in the provided snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Replace DES with a more secure algorithm like AES. AES supports larger key sizes and is generally considered more secure.
- Use a secure random key generation method, and ensure that keys are properly managed (e.g., stored securely, rotated regularly).
- Use CBC mode correctly by generating a new initialization vector randomly for each encryption. This would prevent attacks that rely on a predictable initialization vector.
- Consider adding authentication to your encryption process (e.g., HMAC) to prevent tampering attacks.
- Verify that `inpBytes` should be `text` as per given input.

ORIGINAL CODE:
The original code was supposed to be given, however due to formatting and available information the 'inpBytes' in the doFinal() call seems incorrect to be used for this evaluation.
