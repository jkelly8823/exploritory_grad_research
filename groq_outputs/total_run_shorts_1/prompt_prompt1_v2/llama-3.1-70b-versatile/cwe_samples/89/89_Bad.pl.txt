VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code allows user input to be directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization. Although the `allowList` function appears to be attempting to validate the input by only allowing certain characters, its implementation is flawed. The regular expression used does not account for Unicode characters and may not be effective in preventing an SQL injection attack. Furthermore, even if the input is properly validated, directly inserting user input into a SQL query is a security risk. An attacker could potentially manipulate the query by submitting a carefully crafted input, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. Prepare Statements: Instead of directly inserting user input into the SQL query, use prepared statements with parameterized queries. This approach separates the SQL code from the user input data, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.

Example: 

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO last_names VALUES(:userKey, :name)");
$stmt->bindParam(':userKey', $userKey);
$stmt->bindParam(':name', $name);
$stmt->execute();
```

2. Validate and Sanitize Input: Although not a replacement for prepared statements, proper input validation and sanitization can help prevent other types of attacks. Ensure the `allowList` function or any similar validation logic is secure and effective.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
$userKey = getUserID();
$name = getUserInput();

# ensure only letters, hyphens and apostrophe are allowed
$name = allowList($name, "^a-zA-z'-$");
$query = "INSERT INTO last_names VALUES('$userKey', '$name')";
```
