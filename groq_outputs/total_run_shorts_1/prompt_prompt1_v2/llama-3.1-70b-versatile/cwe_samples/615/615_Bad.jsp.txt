VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Database query vulnerability due to excessive parameters.

EXPLANATION:
The comment mentions that passing more than 30 arguments causes the database connection (JDBC server) to fail. Although the code itself does not show any vulnerability, the comment implies a potential issue. The comment could be referring to a different piece of code that isn't shown here, which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack if an excessive number of parameters are passed. However, without the actual code, this is an educated guess.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Limit the number of parameters that can be passed to the database query.
- Handle cases where the number of parameters exceeds 30 by parsing the data before sending it to the query.
- Use a batch update if a large number of parameters need to be passed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<!-- FIXME: calling this with more than 30 args kills the JDBC server -->
