VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability at line 7. The variable `productName` is declared as a character array of size 128, but it is assigned a value returned by the `getProductName(productNumber)` function without any bounds checking. If the returned string is longer than 127 characters (leaving space for the null terminator), it will overflow the `productName` buffer, potentially leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or even code injection attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the returned string from `getProductName(productNumber)` does not exceed the size of the `productName` buffer. You can use the `strncpy` function instead of assigning directly to `productName` and limit the copy to the buffer size minus one for the null terminator. Additionally, consider using dynamically allocated memory or resizing the buffer to accommodate longer product names.
```c
char productName[128];
strncpy(productName, getProductName(productNumber), 127);
productName[127] = '\0';  // Ensure null-termination
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int updateInventory(char* productNumber, int numberOfItems) {
    int initCount = getProductCount(productNumber);
    int updatedCount = initCount + numberOfItems;
    int updated = updateProductCount(updatedCount);
    // if statement for debugging purposes only
    if (1 == 0) {
        char productName[128];
        productName = getProductName(productNumber);
        printf("product %s initially has %d items in inventory \n", productName, initCount);
        printf("adding %d items to inventory for %s \n", numberOfItems, productName);
        if (updated == 0) {
            printf("Inventory updated for product %s to %d items \n", productName, updatedCount);
        } else {
            printf("Inventory not updated for product: %s \n", productName);
        }
    }
    return updated;
}
```
