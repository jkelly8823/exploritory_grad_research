VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Prototype Pollution Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be vulnerable to a prototype pollution attack. Prototype pollution occurs when an attacker is able to inject properties into the prototype chain of an object, potentially allowing them to manipulate or overwrite key properties of the system. In this code, we see two instances of the `setValueByPath` function being called with a path that includes `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`. This suggests that an attacker could potentially inject properties into the global object or the object's prototype chain, leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure that the `setValueByPath` function is properly sanitized to prevent the use of `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype` as path values. This can be achieved by adding checks to prevent these special properties from being used as part of the path.
2. If the `setValueByPath` function is used to set properties on a user-provided object, consider using the `Object.create(null)` method to create an object without a prototype chain, reducing the risk of prototype pollution.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
setValueByPath({}, "__proto__.isAdmin", true)
setValueByPath({}, "constructor.prototype.isAdmin", true)
```
