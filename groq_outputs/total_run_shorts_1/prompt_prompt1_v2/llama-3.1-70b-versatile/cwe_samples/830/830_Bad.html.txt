VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via a third-party JavaScript file.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet includes a script tag that loads external JavaScript code from "externalDomain.example.com/weatherwidget.js". However, this script is not validated or sanitized before being executed. An attacker could compromise the external domain or manipulate the DNS to redirect to a malicious server. This would allow the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An XSS vulnerability can be used to steal sensitive data, such as session cookies, credentials, or take control of the user's session.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the external JavaScript source before including it on your page. Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to specify which sources of content are allowed to be executed within your application's context.
2. Ensure that the external script is served over HTTPS to prevent tampering by man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
3. Consider hosting the JavaScript file within your own application domain to avoid the risk of a third-party compromise.
4. Review and test for any potential vulnerabilities in the client-side JavaScript code.
