VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper use of the signal function can cause race conditions and potentially lead to undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The signal function is used to establish the handler function for a specific signal. However, it does not specify the type of the handler function, and this can lead to type mismatch and potential undefined behavior when the handler is called. This is because the function parameter is not checked by the signal function, allowing mismatched function pointers to be used as signal handlers.

Moreover, the return value of the signal function is not checked, which means that an error may occur silently if the signal function fails to set the signal handler. If the signal handler function does not exist or cannot be set, signal function will return SIG_ERR, but this return value is not checked in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Cast the handler function to the correct type as required by the C standard for signal handlers. The signature for a signal handler should be 'void (*func)(int)'.
2. Always check the return value of the signal function to ensure that the signal handler was successfully set. If SIG_ERR is returned, error handling should be performed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  void handler (int sigNum) {...}
                     int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {signal(SIGUSR1, handler); signal(SIGUSR2, handler)}
