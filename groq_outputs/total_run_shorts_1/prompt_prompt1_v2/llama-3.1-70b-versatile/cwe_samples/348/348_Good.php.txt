VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to IP spoofing via HTTP headers.

EXPLANATION:
The issue is caused by the direct trust in the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header. This header can be easily manipulated by an attacker, therefore, it's not a reliable source for identifying the requesting IP. By directly returning an error message when this header is present, the application fails to properly handle and validate the IP addresses. Furthermore, the 'else' condition suggests that the application uses 'REMOTE_ADDR' when 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' is not present. 'REMOTE_ADDR' is a trusted source for identifying the IP address, however, implicitly trusting it without proper validation is also a potential issue.

However, the vulnerability is most prominent with respect to trusting 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'. If this header is present, the application doesn't verify its content. If it contains multiple IP addresses, a common occurrence in reverse proxy configurations, the application assumes a different security stance based on this header alone.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of simply relying on 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' to make security decisions, consider the following:

- Verify that 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' is a valid, trusted header (for example, by checking its content and its format).
- Trust 'REMOTE_ADDR' only if 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' is empty or null.
- Consider the possibility of an attacker using a proxy and provide better handling and error messages for this scenario.

It's also recommended to securely parse and handle IP addresses to avoid any potential IP spoofing attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$requestingIP = '0.0.0.0';if (array_key_exists('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER)) {echo "This application cannot be accessed through a proxy.";return;
else{$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];}
```
