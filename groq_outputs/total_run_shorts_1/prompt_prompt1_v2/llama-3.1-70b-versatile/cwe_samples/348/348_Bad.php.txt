VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Improper Use of HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR for IP Validation
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet uses the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header to obtain the client's IP address. However, this approach is vulnerable to IP spoofing attacks, as malicious clients can easily modify this header to provide a false IP address.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle cases where multiple IP addresses are provided in the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header, as is common with proxy servers. The first IP address in the list is taken as the client's IP address without any validation. This makes it possible for an attacker to bypass IP restrictions by including a whitelisted IP address in the header.

Furthermore, if the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header is not present, the code correctly falls back to using 'REMOTE_ADDR', but it does not account for the possibility that 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' may be an empty string or contain only IP addresses that are not in the allowlist.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Use a more secure method for IP validation, such as relying on 'REMOTE_ADDR' rather than 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'. If you must use 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', ensure that you properly validate and extract the client's IP address.
2.  Implement a more robust IP allowlist check, considering all provided IP addresses in the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header and verifying them against the allowlist.
3.  Consider using a more secure way to handle unknown or untrusted client IP addresses.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$requestingIP = '0.0.0.0';if (array_key_exists('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER)) {$requestingIP = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
                     else{$requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];}
                     if(in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowlist)){generatePage();return;}else{echo "You are not authorized to view this page";return;}
