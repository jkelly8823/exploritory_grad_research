VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a segment of digital circuitry implementation in a hardware description language, likely Verilog. It includes instantiations of two modules (i_bootrom_patch and i_bootrom_linux) and assigns the output based on a selection signal (ariane_boot_sel_i). After analyzing the code, I could not find any potential vulnerabilities.

The main logic involves selecting data from either i_bootrom_patch or i_bootrom_linux based on the value of ariane_boot_sel_i. This selection does not include any external inputs that could introduce potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is no obvious indication of data being improperly sanitized, user inputs not validated, insecure memory practices, or use of insecure functions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations for this code snippet.
ORIGINAL CODE:


						bootrom i_bootrom_patch (
							
							.clk_i                   ,
							.req_i      ( rom_req   ),
							.addr_i     ( rom_addr  ),
							.rdata_o    ( rom_rdata_patch )
							
						);
						bootrom_linux i_bootrom_linux (
							
							.clk_i                   ,
							.req_i      ( rom_req   ),
							.addr_i     ( rom_addr  ),
							.rdata_o    ( rom_rdata_linux )
							
						);
						
					assign rom_rdata = (ariane_boot_sel_i) ? rom_rdata_patch : rom_rdata_linux;
