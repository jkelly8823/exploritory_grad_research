VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-10
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an Unrestricted Resource Consumption bug. The creation of a new thread in the doGet method without any limits can lead to excessive resource consumption.

EXPLANATION:
The creation of a new thread in the doGet method without any checks or limits on the number of threads that can be created can lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability. If the servlet is subjected to a high volume of requests, the creation of a new thread for each request can lead to excessive resource consumption, potentially causing the JVM to run out of threads or resources. This can make the servlet unresponsive or even lead to a crash.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should consider using a thread pool to manage the threads. A thread pool allows you to limit the number of threads that are created and reuses existing threads to handle new requests. You can use the ExecutorService class in Java to create a thread pool.

Here is an example of how you can modify the code to use a thread pool:

```java
private ExecutorService executor;

public void init() {
    executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); // Create a thread pool with 10 threads
}

public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Perform servlet tasks.
    ...
    Runnable r = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            // Process and store request statistics.
            ...
        }
    };
    executor.execute(r);
}

public void destroy() {
    executor.shutdown();
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        
    // Perform servlet tasks.
    ...
    
    // Create a new thread to handle background processing.
    Runnable r = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            // Process and store request statistics.
            ...
        }
    };
    new Thread(r).start();
}
```
