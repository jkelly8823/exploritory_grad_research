VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The scanf() function is used to read input from the user, but it does not perform any bounds checking on the input length. The input is stored in the 'last_name' character array, which has a fixed size of 20 characters. If the user enters a string longer than 19 characters (leaving one space for the null-terminator), it will overflow the buffer, potentially causing the program to crash or execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use a function that checks the input length, such as fgets(), instead of scanf(). Additionally, you can use a safer function to copy the input string to the 'last_name' array, such as strncpy(). Here's a revised version of the code:

```c
char last_name[20];
printf("Enter your last name: ");
fgets(last_name, sizeof(last_name), stdin);
// Remove the newline character from the end of the string
last_name[strcspn(last_name, "\n")] = 0;
```

Alternatively, you can use scanf with a width specifier to limit the input length:

```c
char last_name[20];
printf("Enter your last name: ");
scanf("%19s", last_name);  // Leave one space for the null-terminator
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
char last_name[20];printf ("Enter your last name: ");scanf ("%s", last_name);
```
