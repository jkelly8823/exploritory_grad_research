VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet does not validate the boundary condition where the variable "len" is zero, which could potentially lead to a division by zero or other undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The snippet provided includes a conditional statement that checks if an array index is within a certain range defined by 0 and "len". However, it does not validate whether "len" is zero or less than zero. If "len" equals zero, the check for "index < len" does not prevent the potential undefined behavior. This can occur when dealing with an empty array. It is often better to explicitly validate and handle such cases to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this issue, we recommend adding an additional check to ensure "len" is not equal to zero before performing the conditional statement. This check may be added before or as part of the existing if statement.

```c
if (len > 0 && index >= 0 && index < len) {
  ...
}
```
Alternatively, if dealing with potential negative "len" values makes sense within the given context:
```c
if (len >= 0 && index >= 0 && index < len) {
  ...
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
// check that the array index is within the correct
// range of values for the array
if (index >= 0 && index < len) {
  ...
```
