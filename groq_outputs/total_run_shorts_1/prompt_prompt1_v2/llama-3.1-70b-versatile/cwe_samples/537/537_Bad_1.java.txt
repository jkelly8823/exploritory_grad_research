VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9, 15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability exists in the code due to the storage and transmission of sensitive data (username and password) in clear text. Additionally, the exception thrown during an authentication failure contains the username and password.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, user credentials are handled insecurely. When a login failure occurs, the error message includes the username and password, which can potentially leak sensitive information. Furthermore, the code directly passes user input (username and password) from the request parameter to the `authenticateUser` method without proper sanitization. This could be exploited if the `authenticateUser` method does not have adequate input validation.

However, the most critical vulnerability in this code is the possibility of disclosure of sensitive information, not a direct means of exploiting the code for malicious purposes. This still poses a significant risk as the attacker could obtain the credentials by inspecting the exception message or error page.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Sanitize user input: Ensure the `authenticateUser` method properly validates the input data to prevent potential injection attacks. 

2. Avoid transmitting sensitive data in plain text: Use secure protocols for transmitting sensitive data. Ensure that usernames and passwords are encrypted and/or hashed for secure storage and transmission.

3. Remove sensitive data from error messages: When throwing exceptions, avoid including sensitive data in the error messages. Instead, create a more generic error message that does not disclose sensitive information.

4. Implement a secure authentication mechanism: Consider using a tried and tested authentication library or framework that adheres to security best practices.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
public class BankManagerLoginServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
            // Get username and password from login page request
            String username = request.getParameter("username");String password = request.getParameter("password");
            // Authenticate user
            BankManager bankMgr = new BankManager();boolean isAuthentic = bankMgr.authenticateUser(username, password);
            // If user is authenticated then go to successful login page
            if (isAuthentic) {request.setAttribute("login", new String("Login Successful."));getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/BankManagerServiceLoggedIn.jsp"). forward(request, response);}else {
                // Otherwise, raise failed login exception and output unsuccessful login message to error page
                throw new FailedLoginException("Failed Login for user " + username + " with password " + password);
            }
        } catch (FailedLoginException ex) {
            // output failed login message to error page
            request.setAttribute("error", new String("Login Error"));request.setAttribute("message", ex.getMessage());getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/ErrorPage.jsp").forward(request, response);
        }
    }
