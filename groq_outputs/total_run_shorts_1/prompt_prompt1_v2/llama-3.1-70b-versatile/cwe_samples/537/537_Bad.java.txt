VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet has a potential vulnerability in the readInputFile() method, where it catches a RuntimeException and then uses the inputFilePath variable to print an error message without proper validation. This could lead to an information disclosure vulnerability if runtime exceptions are caused by other issues unrelated to file input, allowing potential attackers to gain information about the system configuration and environment.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the catch block for RuntimeException, where it prints the inputFilePath variable without proper validation. Although the comment above the setInputFile method mentions that "appropriate validation / encoding is used and privileges / permissions are preserved", this does not apply to the readInputFile method. If an exception is thrown in the try block for reasons other than a file not found, it could contain sensitive information about the system environment. By printing this error message with the inputFilePath, the code could inadvertently disclose system information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommended changes:
- Avoid using broad catch blocks for RuntimeException and instead catch specific exceptions that you expect to occur.
- Log the error at a different level (e.g., INFO or DEBUG) and exclude sensitive information.
- Implement proper error handling and validation in the readInputFile method to ensure that it does not leak sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:


public class InputFileRead {
    
    private File readFile = null;private FileReader reader = null;private String inputFilePath = null;private final String DEFAULT_FILE_PATH = "c:\\somedirectory\\";
    public InputFileRead() {inputFilePath = DEFAULT_FILE_PATH;}
    public void setInputFile(String inputFile) {
         
        
         /* Assume appropriate validation / encoding is used and privileges / permissions are preserved */
         
      
    }
    public void readInputFile() {
        try {reader = new FileReader(readFile);...} catch (RuntimeException rex) {System.err.println("Error: Cannot open input file in the directory " + inputFilePath);System.err.println("Input file has not been set, call setInputFile method before calling readInputFile");
         
         } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {...}
      
    }
