VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
LDAP Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the 'searchFilter' string where user input ('address') is directly concatenated without any validation or sanitization. This allows a potential attacker to inject malicious LDAP queries, potentially leading to data exposure or other security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a prepared query or parameterized query instead of directly concatenating user input. Many LDAP libraries offer built-in support for parameterized queries, which can help prevent LDAP injection.

The code should be modified to use a parameterized query like this:

```
String searchFilter = "(StreetAddress={0})";
Object[] params = { address };
NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, params, searchCtls);
```

Additionally, consider implementing input validation and sanitization for the 'address' variable to prevent potential attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
context = new InitialDirContext(env);String searchFilter = "StreetAddress=" + address;NamingEnumeration answer = context.search(searchBase, searchFilter, searchCtls);
```
