VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Assignment in Condition Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains an assignment operation within a condition statement. Specifically, the line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl))` assigns the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to the variable `cert` and then checks the result. However, this can lead to unintended behavior, as the assignment operation will always return the assigned value, which will be truthy if `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` returns a non-null pointer. This can potentially mask errors or lead to incorrect logic flow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to change the assignment to a comparison operation. Instead of assigning the result of `SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)` to `cert` within the `if` statement, compare the result directly:

```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (NULL != cert) {
    // code to handle the certificate
}
```

Alternatively, use a more explicit comparison operation:

```c
cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
if (cert != NULL) {
    // code to handle the certificate
}
```

This change ensures that the condition is evaluated correctly, reducing the risk of unintended behavior.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {
    // got certificate, host can be trusted
    //foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
    //if (X509_V_OK==foo) ...
}
```
