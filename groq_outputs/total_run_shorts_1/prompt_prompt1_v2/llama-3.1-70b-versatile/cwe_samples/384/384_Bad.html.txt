VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Username and Password Stored in Plaintext and Sent Over Insecure Channel

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains a form sending a username and password over a POST request to 'j_security_check'.  However, the form does not have any security measures to encrypt the data being sent.  This submission is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and packet sniffing.  Given that this is a simple form without HTTPS encryption in place, any credentials transmitted through this form may be sent in plaintext.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the recommendations below:
- Ensure that HTTPS encryption is enabled for the application, and all communication with the application occurs over a secure, trusted channel.
- Modify the form's 'j_security_check' action URL to use HTTPS (e.g., "https://server/j_security_check").
- Validate and test that all communication between the client and server is encrypted, to prevent credentials from being transmitted in plaintext.

ORIGINAL CODE:
<form method="POST" action="j_security_check"><input type="text" name="j_username"><input type="text" name="j_password"></form>
