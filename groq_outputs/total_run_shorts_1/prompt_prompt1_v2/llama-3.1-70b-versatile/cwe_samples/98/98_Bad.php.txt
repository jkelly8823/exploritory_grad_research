VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code contains a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the direct use of a user-supplied input (`$_GET['module_name']`) in the `include` statement.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability occurs when user-provided input from the `module_name` GET parameter is directly used in the `include` statement without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `module_name` value to include any arbitrary file, potentially leading to code execution or sensitive information disclosure. The `include` statement is used to load PHP files, which can contain executable PHP code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, perform the following:

1. Validate the user input: Use a whitelist approach to ensure that the `module_name` value is one of the expected and allowed values.
2. Use a secure method for including files: Instead of using the `include` statement with user-provided input, use a secure method such as `require_once` with a hardcoded file path or a validated input.
3. Implement a robust access control mechanism: Ensure that only authorized users can access the `module_name` parameter and that the `function.php` file is not accessible directly.
4. Consider using a more secure way of loading dependencies, such as using an autoloader or a dependency injection mechanism.

ORIGINAL CODE:
$dir = $_GET['module_name'];include($dir . "/function.php");
