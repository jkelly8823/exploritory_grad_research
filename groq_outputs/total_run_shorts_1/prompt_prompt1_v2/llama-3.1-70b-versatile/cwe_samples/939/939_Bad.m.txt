VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to a malicious URL scheme attack. The `writeDataToView` method is called with user-controlled data from the URL query, which can potentially lead to a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
In this code snippet, the `writeDataToView` method is called with the query string from the URL. This query string can contain malicious code, which can be executed by the `UIWebView`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the webview, potentially leading to a UXSS vulnerability.

The fact that the `writeDataToView` method is called with user-controlled data from the URL query without proper validation and sanitization makes it possible for an attacker to execute malicious code. This is particularly concerning, as this code is executing in the context of the native iOS application, allowing access to sensitive device resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend implementing proper validation and sanitization of the URL query before passing it to the `writeDataToView` method. Here are some suggested steps:

1.  Validate the query string: Before passing the query string to the `writeDataToView` method, validate its contents to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code. This can be done by using a whitelist approach, where you only allow specific query parameters.
2.  Sanitize the query string: Use a sanitization function to remove any malicious characters or code from the query string.
3.  Use a different approach: Instead of passing the query string directly to the `writeDataToView` method, consider using a different approach to pass data between the native application and the webview. This could involve using native bridges or messaging mechanisms.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```objc
// iOS
- (BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType {
    NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];
    if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"]) {
        NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];
        if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"]) {
            // Make data available back in webview.
            UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
            return NO;
        }
        return YES;
    }
    return YES;
}
