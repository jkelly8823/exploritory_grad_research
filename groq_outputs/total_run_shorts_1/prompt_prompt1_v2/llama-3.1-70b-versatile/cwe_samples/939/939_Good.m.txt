VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Potential Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) Vulnerability and Insecure URL Redirect

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet creates a URL from a string that contains a scheme and a text parameter. It then opens this URL using the `openURL:` method. However, this code does not validate or sanitize the text parameter, which comes from an external source ("incomingMessage.txt"). A malicious actor could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the text parameter, leading to a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability when the URL is opened.

Furthermore, the code uses a custom scheme ("appscheme") for the URL, which may not be validated or sanitized properly. If the text parameter contains malicious content, it could be executed in the context of the app, leading to arbitrary code execution.

Additionally, the code does not validate whether the URL can be opened safely before opening it. This can potentially lead to an insecure URL redirect vulnerability if an attacker is able to control the URL scheme or the parameters.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should:

1. Validate and sanitize the text parameter to prevent injection of malicious code.
2. Validate the URL scheme and parameters to ensure they are safe to open.
3. Use a secure method to open the URL, such as checking whether the URL can be opened safely before opening it.

A secure example of how to implement this in iOS would be:

- Validate the URL scheme
- Use a whitelisted set of valid schemes
```objectivec
NSString *stringURL = @"appscheme://replaceFileText?file=incomingMessage.txt&text=hello";
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:stringURL];

if ([[url scheme] isEqual:@"appscheme"]) {
    // Additional validation for appscheme can be added here
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url options:@{} completionHandler:^(BOOL success) {
        if (!success) {
            NSLog(@"Failed to open URL: %@", url);
        }
    }];
} else {
    NSLog(@"Invalid URL scheme: %@", [url scheme]);
}
```
In addition to this, incoming message text should be sanitized properly, e.g., using `[NSString stringByAppendingString:]`, or `stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:withString:`

ORIGINAL CODE:
```objectivec
NSString *stringURL = @"appscheme://replaceFileText?file=incomingMessage.txt&text=hello";
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:stringURL];
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url];
```
