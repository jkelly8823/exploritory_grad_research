VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: The provided code snippet does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
After reviewing the code snippet, I found that the class `Dead` is well-defined and doesn't seem to contain any inherent vulnerabilities. The `glue` field is declared private by default (in the absence of an access modifier), and the getter method `getGlue()` always returns a hardcoded value "glue". Since the code doesn't depend on any external or user-controlled inputs, and the provided methods do not have any obvious security flaws, I couldn't identify any vulnerabilities in the provided code.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Based on my analysis, no changes are recommended for this code snippet as it doesn't appear to be vulnerable.
ORIGINAL CODE:
public class Dead {
    String glue;
    public String getGlue() {return "glue";}
}
