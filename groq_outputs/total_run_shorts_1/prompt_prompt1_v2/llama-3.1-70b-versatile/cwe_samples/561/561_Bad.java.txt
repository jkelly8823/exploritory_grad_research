VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Infinite Recursion Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains two methods, `doTweedledee()` and `doTweedledumb()`, where each method calls the other, causing an infinite recursion. This type of recursion does not have a base case to terminate the recursive calls, which can ultimately lead to a `StackOverflowError` at runtime.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Introduce a base case to terminate the recursion by adding a condition to stop the recursive calls.
2. Modify the methods to avoid the infinite recursion, possibly by removing the need for mutual calls between the methods.
3. Consider rewriting the methods to avoid recursion altogether, if possible.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public class DoubleDead {
    private void doTweedledee() {
        doTweedledumb();
    }
    private void doTweedledumb() {
        doTweedledee();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("running DoubleDead");
    }
}
```
