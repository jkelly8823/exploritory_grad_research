VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to insecure initialization of the `Secure_mode` variable and usage of an incorrect or unspecified default value for the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains two instances of the `register_example` module, used as `Insecure_Device_ID_1` and `Insecure_Device_ID_2`. The `Insecure_Device_ID_1` instance uses an incorrect value of `1224` for the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter, which sets `Secure_mode` to `0`, making the register readable and writable. The `Insecure_Device_ID_2` instance does not specify the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter, which will use the default value of `2**REGISTER_WIDTH -2`, setting all bits to `1` and the `Secure_mode` to `1`, making the register read-only.

However, if the intention is to make the registers secure by default, using `2**REGISTER_WIDTH -2` as the default value might not ensure that the `Secure_mode` is always `1` (i.e., making the register read-only). If the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` value is set such that the least significant bit is `0`, the `Secure_mode` will be `0`, making the register readable and writable, which might be considered a vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` value is set such that the least significant bit is `1`, making the `Secure_mode` `1` and the register read-only. For example, replace the value `1224` with a value that has its least significant bit set to `1`.

For the `Insecure_Device_ID_1` instance:
```
register_example #( 
  .REGISTER_WIDTH (32), 
  .REGISTER_DEFAULT (2147483647) // A value that has its least significant bit set to 1
```

For the `Insecure_Device_ID_2` instance, specify the `REGISTER_DEFAULT` parameter:
```
register_example #( 
  .REGISTER_WIDTH (32), 
  .REGISTER_DEFAULT (2147483647) // A value that has its least significant bit set to 1
```
