VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and unescaped user input. However, more notably, the code is vulnerable to unverified and potentially unencrypted user authentication, which may allow for a ' Weak Password in Authentication Scheme ' vulnerability, as well as potential 'Insufficient Input Validation' and weak data handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves user and password inputs directly from the HTTP POST request, using the $_POST superglobal array in PHP. Although this action itself may not create a vulnerability, how it's handled determines the potential presence of vulnerability issues. Direct and unvalidated input from users poses potential security risks. Furthermore, the potential reliance on 'login_user()' function to secure the program will ultimately leave this code to the mercy of the implementation of the 'login_user()' function itself.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
In general, when receiving sensitive information over an HTTP POST request, verification, validation, and security should always be an immediate concern:
1. **Input validation:** Validate that user input conforms to the required and accepted data. Ensure that PHP error handling code isn't reachable by untrusted users and provide measures to clean and remove unacceptable data.
2. **Encoding:** Where application-served content needs to be reflected into client-side-executed JS snippets, ensure using additional data encoding (depending on requirements) like base64 encoding (etc).
3. **Validating passwords:** Confirm that passwords being received are strong, stored correctly and any other data being retrieved securely from $_POST['user'] and $_POST['pass'] using libraries like PHP's built-in 'PASSWORD_HASHER' and more secure practices like salting passwords.
4. **A secure and more reliable communication mechanism should be preferred over a simple password mechanism when sensitive credentials are transferred over an open, HTTP protocol, e.g HTTP protocol can be switched to be HTTPS or TLS protocol for all.
Here is more of the thought of keeping requirements on safer side in terms of preventing attacks in the first place and better password handling.
5. Verify thoroughly, in conjunction with what you can predict will be included into 'login_user()' function that is called to 'log a person into an app successfully', ensure this provides additional safety for further validating that every credential passed through is safe and valid.
6. Prefer using $_SERVER[] or different superglobals each for the best according to the scenario provided at PHP or always ensure POST parameters you are accepting during app interaction are sanitized enough and according to the expected parameters
