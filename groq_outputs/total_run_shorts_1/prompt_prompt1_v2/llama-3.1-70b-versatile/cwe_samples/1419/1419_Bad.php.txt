VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential authentication bypass vulnerability is present in the code due to the direct usage of user input ($user and $pass) without sanitization or validation.

EXPLANATION:
The code checks if the user can be logged in using the provided credentials, but it lacks validation and sanitization for the $user and $pass variables. This means that the code relies on the expectation that the $user and $pass variables contain valid and secure values. However, since the code snippet shows that these variables are set from a POST request, an attacker might manipulate the POST request to inject malicious data, potentially bypassing authentication.

Additionally, there is no validation of the $authorized variable itself. The code assumes that the $authorized variable will only be set to true if the user can be logged in, but in the presence of another flaw, this might not be the case.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement input validation and sanitization for the $user and $pass variables, ensuring they adhere to your expected format.
- Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries if the login_user function interacts with a database.
- Validate the output of the login_user function to prevent potential information disclosure.
- Implement additional checks to ensure the $authorized variable is updated correctly.

ORIGINAL CODE:


// $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
if (login_user($user,$pass)) {$authorized = true;}
...
if ($authorized) {generatePage();}
