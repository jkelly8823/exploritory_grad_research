VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double free vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
A double free vulnerability occurs when the same memory location is freed twice. This can lead to undefined behavior and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. In this code snippet, the `ptr` memory location is freed twice: once within the `if (abrt)` block and again after the block.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this double free vulnerability, ensure that the `ptr` memory location is only freed once. If the `if (abrt)` block is intended to handle an error condition, consider setting `ptr` to `NULL` after freeing it to prevent accidental double free. Here is an example of how the fixed code might look:
```c
char* ptr = (char*)malloc(SIZE);
if (abrt) {
    free(ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
} 
if (ptr != NULL) {
    free(ptr);
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
                   char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);
				   ...
				   if (abrt) {
				   
					 free(ptr);
				   
				   }
				   ...
				   free(ptr);
				 
                ```
