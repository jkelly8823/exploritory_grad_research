VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. The `$Username` variable is populated with untrusted input from `GetUntrustedInput()`, which is then used to construct a file path. Although an attempt is made to sanitize the input by removing the '../' string, it's not sufficient as an attacker could still exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input, such as ../../../../etc/passwd. This input would bypass the sanitization and allow the attacker to access files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or disclosure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a more robust input validation mechanism to ensure that only authorized usernames are accepted and processed.
2. Use a whitelisting approach to restrict the input to a specific set of allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters).
3. Instead of using a string replacement to remove '../', consider using a proper path canonicalization function to normalize the input and prevent directory traversal attacks.
4. Consider using a secure method to store and retrieve files, such as using a token-based approach or hashing the usernames.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();
$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;
my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;
ReadAndSendFile($filename);
```
