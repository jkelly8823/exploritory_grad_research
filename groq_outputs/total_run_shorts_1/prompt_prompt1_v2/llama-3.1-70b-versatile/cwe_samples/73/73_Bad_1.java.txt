VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Temp File Handling and Potential File Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet reads a file name from a configuration property 'sub', appends '.txt' to it, and reads its contents. The issue arises from directly using unsanitized user-controlled input (cfg.getProperty("sub")) to create a file path. This could allow an attacker to traverse directory paths or access files with sensitive information. Furthermore, the use of temp files without properly securing them can lead to information disclosure.

Additionally, the code doesn't handle exceptions that might occur during the file I/O operations. If the specified file doesn't exist, an exception would be thrown, potentially revealing information about the file system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate these vulnerabilities:

- Validate user input: Ensure that cfg.getProperty("sub") only contains expected values and sanitizes any user-controlled input.
- Use secure file path creation: Use a secure method for creating file paths, such as Path.resolve(from, to) to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- Handle exceptions: Implement proper error handling and logging to avoid revealing sensitive information.
- Read files securely: Consider using a library like Apache Commons IO for secure file I/O operations.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
fis = new FileInputStream(cfg.getProperty("sub")+".txt"); 
amt = fis.read(arr);
out.println(arr);
