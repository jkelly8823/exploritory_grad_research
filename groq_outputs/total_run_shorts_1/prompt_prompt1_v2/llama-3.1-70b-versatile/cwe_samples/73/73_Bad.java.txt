VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, also known as a directory traversal attack. The `request.getParameter("reportName")` retrieves user input and directly appends it to a file path. This allows an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the `reportName` parameter. For example, if an attacker sends a request with `reportName` set to `../../../../etc/passwd`, the code would attempt to delete the `/etc/passwd` file.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should:

1. Sanitize and validate the user input to prevent directory traversal. You can use a library like OWASP's ESAPI or Apache Commons IO to perform safe path manipulation.
2. Avoid using user input directly in file paths. Instead, consider storing reports in a secure, isolated directory with a random or unique identifier.
3. Use a secure naming convention for reports, such as using a hash of the report name.

ORIGINAL CODE:
String rName = request.getParameter("reportName");File rFile = new File("/usr/local/apfr/reports/" + rName);...rFile.delete();
