VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unrestricted Insecure Data Path
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability refers to a data path that is inadequately secured, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive information or inject malicious data.

In this specific case, the 'data_out' is set based on the value of 'grant_access', which is determined by the 'usr_id'. However, the 'usr_id' is not properly validated or sanitized. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass security checks by providing a specific 'usr_id' that grants access to sensitive data.

Furthermore, the assignment of 'grant_access' is based solely on the 'usr_id' being equal to 3'h4, which is a relatively weak condition for security purposes. This condition could be easily exploited by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should:
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization for 'usr_id' to prevent malicious data from being injected.
- Use more robust security conditions for granting access to sensitive data.
- Consider implementing additional security measures such as encryption or access control lists (ACLs) to secure the data path.
- Ensure that the 'grant_access' condition is based on multiple factors, making it more difficult for an attacker to bypass security checks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

            always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
            begin
			    
		    if (!rst_n)
		   
			data_out = 0;
		   
		    else
		   
			assign grant_access = (usr_id == 3'h4) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
			data_out = (grant_access) ? data_in : data_out;
		   
		    end
            endmodule
