VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal and Unintended File Disclosure Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a PHP function that reads the contents of a file and checks if the current user is authorized to view it. However, the function does not perform any validation or sanitization of the `filename` parameter passed to it. This allows an attacker to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities and potentially read or disclose sensitive files on the system.

Furthermore, the `isOwnerOf` function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but if it does not properly validate the file ownership or path, it may also be vulnerable to similar attacks.

The use of `file_get_contents` function can also lead to unintended file disclosure if an attacker manages to provide a specially crafted filename that points to a sensitive file or location on the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

- Validate and sanitize the `filename` parameter to prevent path traversal attacks.
- Use a whitelist of allowed file names or extensions to ensure only specific types of files can be read.
- Verify the existence of the file and its location to prevent unintended file disclosure.
- Use a safer alternative to `file_get_contents` such as `readfile` if possible.
- Ensure the `isOwnerOf` function is secure and properly checks the file ownership.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function printFile($username,$filename){
    //read file into string
    $file = file_get_contents($filename);if ($file && isOwnerOf($username,$filename)){echo $file;return true;}else{echo 'You are not authorized to view this file';}return false;
}
```
