VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated and Unsandboxed Input to sscanf(3) Function

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The `sscanf` function is used to parse input from a socket into two integer variables `num` and `size`. However, the `sscanf` function does not perform any validation on the input, and the input is not sanitized.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to send specially crafted input to the socket, potentially causing a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior. The lack of validation and sanitization makes it possible for an attacker to inject malicious input that could lead to a denial of service or potentially even remote code execution.

Furthermore, the use of `sscanf` with a fixed format string (`"%d %d"`) does not protect against buffer overflows, since `sscanf` does not limit the number of characters read. If the input to `sscanf` is larger than the buffer, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Validate and sanitize the input before passing it to `sscanf`. Make sure that the input conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious characters.
2. Use a safer alternative to `sscanf`, such as `int fscanf()` or `int read()`, which provides more control over the input and helps prevent format string vulnerabilities.
3. Use a more secure parsing function, such as `int strtoimax()` or `int strtoul()`, to parse the input into integer variables.
4. Implement proper error checking and handling for the `sscanf` function, including checking the return value and handling potential errors.

ORIGINAL CODE:


<!-- code snippet -->
/* capture the sizes of all messages */
int getsizes(int sock, int count, int *sizes) {
    /* ... */
    while ((ok = gen_recv(sock, buf, sizeof(buf))) == 0){
        if (DOTLINE(buf))break;
        else if (sscanf(buf, "%d %d", &num, &size) == 2)sizes[num - 1] = size;
    }
    /* ... */
}
