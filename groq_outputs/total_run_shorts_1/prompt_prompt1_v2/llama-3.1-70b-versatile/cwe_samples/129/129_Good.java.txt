VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The method displayProductSummary has a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability in its initial declaration of the variable productSummary, but a new declaration of productSummary within the try block creates a shadowed variable. However, this error isn't significant enough for this case. 
The main issue here is an error-prone exception handling mechanism being used for swallowing all possible exceptions.
EXPLANATION:
In Java, declaring a variable with the same name as an existing variable within a block creates a shadowed variable. The outer variable remains inaccessible and unchanged. When variable `productSummary` is initialized within `displayProductSummary`, the variable within `try` also uses this name which hides the variable in the outer scope for the block.

Avoid unchecked try-catch block catching all types of Exceptions, provide meaningful error feedback when exceptions are encountered and also perform error handling for such exceptions to improve the application reliability. Examine thoroughly if `getProductSummary` index out of bounds error for an exception and refactor it with a less error-prone approach with correct error feedback.

Even if you use this vague catch-all mechanism to log or output the exception internally within `getProductSummary`, then also it leads to lack of potentially beneficial diagnostics information.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement informed exception handling throughout your program, e.g.,
```java
String productSummary = getProductSummary(index); // call checked exceptions 

// Error-prone approach to exception handling 
// catch (Exception ex) {...} 

// Consider specific types of exceptions and act accordingly 
catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {...} // Log or handle based on requirement  
catch (Exception e){logging statement; re-throw the exception}  // Keep exceptions to the smallest possible scope
```
Also, refactor `displayProductSummary` method
```java
String productSummary;
try {
    productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {... logging} 
catch (Exception ex) {... other log and code } 
return productSummary;
```
