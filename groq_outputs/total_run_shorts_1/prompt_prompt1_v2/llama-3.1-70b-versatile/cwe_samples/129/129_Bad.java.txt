VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Array Index Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to an array index out-of-bounds error. This occurs because there is no bounds checking when accessing the array element at the specified index. If the index exceeds the length of the array, it will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Furthermore, if an attacker can provide an arbitrary index (potentially negative), this could lead to unexpected behavior or potential code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend adding bounds checking to ensure that the index is within the valid range of the array. This can be achieved by comparing the index against the array's length and throwing an exception if it's out of range.

ORIGINAL CODE:

public String getValue(int index) {return array[index];}
