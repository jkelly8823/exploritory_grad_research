VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains hard-coded sensitive information, including a username and password, in plain text.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file, which is used to store configuration data. However, it contains sensitive information such as a username and password in plain text. This is a significant security risk because an attacker who gains access to this file can easily obtain the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure method to store sensitive information such as environment variables, a secrets manager, or encrypted files. The sensitive information should never be hard-coded in plain text. Here are some steps to take:

* Move the sensitive information to a secure storage location, such as an environment variable or a secrets manager.
* Use a secure method to retrieve the sensitive information from the storage location, such as using a library that provides secure access to environment variables.
* Remove the hard-coded sensitive information from the ResourceBundle properties file.
* Consider using encrypted files or secure storage solutions, such as HashiCorp's Vault, to store sensitive information.
