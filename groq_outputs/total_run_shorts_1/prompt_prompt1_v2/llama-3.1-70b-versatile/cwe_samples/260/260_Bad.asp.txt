VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data - The code snippet contains a plain text password for database connection.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a connection string from a .NET configuration file. The connection string contains a username ("db2admin") and a password ("password"). Hardcoding a password directly in the connection string can lead to insecure storage of sensitive data, potentially allowing an attacker to obtain the password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure the code, the password should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable, a secure configuration store, or encrypted using a secrets manager. Additionally, consider using Integrated Security or Windows Authentication to eliminate the need to store passwords altogether.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" 
  providerName="System.Data.Odbc" />
</connectionStrings>
```
