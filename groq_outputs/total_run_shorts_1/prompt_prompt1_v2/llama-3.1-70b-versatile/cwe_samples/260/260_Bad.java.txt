VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
Hardcoded credentials are sensitive data that are stored directly in the code. This poses a significant security risk as they can be easily discovered by an attacker who gains access to the code. In this case, the ldap username and password are hardcoded directly into the webapp configuration. This allows anyone who can view the code to obtain these credentials, which could allow unauthorized access to the LDAP system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Hardcoded credentials should be avoided. Instead, consider using a secure method to store sensitive data, such as environment variables or a secrets management tool. Environment variables can be set at runtime, and secrets management tools provide secure storage and retrieval of sensitive data.

Here's an example of how to secure the code:

```python
import os

webapp.ldap.username = os.environ['LDAP_USERNAME']
webapp.ldap.password = os.environ['LDAP_PASSWORD']
```

Alternatively, you can use a secrets management tool to securely store and retrieve the credentials.

ORIGINAL CODE:
webapp.ldap.username = secretUsername
webapp.ldap.password = secretPassword
