VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code intentionally throws an IOException when an object is attempted to be deserialized. However, the fact that it is private and throws an exception means it is not attempting to properly handle the deserialization process. Relying solely on throwing exceptions for security is often a weak substitute for actually fixing underlying security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
In many cases, deserialization vulnerabilities arise due to the way the deserialization process handles incoming data. By simply throwing an exception when an attempt is made to deserialize an object, this code might not resolve some unintended deserialization vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure you maintain control over serialized data and avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible.
2. Instead of simply throwing an exception, use proper deserialization techniques and validate any data read during the process.
3. Implement robust validation checks in the ObjectInputStream to detect potential malicious activity.
4. Consider overriding other methods like readResolve, readObjectNoData, etc., to ensure proper deserialization behavior.

ORIGINAL CODE:
private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws java.io.IOException {throw new java.io.IOException("Cannot be deserialized"); }
