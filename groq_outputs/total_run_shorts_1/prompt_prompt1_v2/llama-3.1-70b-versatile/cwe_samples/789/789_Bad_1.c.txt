VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow vulnerability. The code attempts to create a buffer with a potentially negative length, which can lead to undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION:
In this code, `b` is greater than `a` (6 > 5), resulting in `len` being a negative value (-1). When the code attempts to declare an array `buf` with a negative length, it can cause a buffer overflow. In C, when a negative length is passed to an array declaration, it will actually allocate a large amount of memory on the stack due to integer underflow, which can lead to undefined behavior, resulting in potential crashes or code exploitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ensure the length calculation produces a positive value to prevent potential integer underflow. 
2. Check for potential errors in the calculation of the buffer length and handle them properly.
3. Use Secure Coding practices to prevent stack-based buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:

	    	int a = 5, b = 6;
		    size_t len = a - b;
		    char buf[len];    // Just blows up the stack
		  
		  }
