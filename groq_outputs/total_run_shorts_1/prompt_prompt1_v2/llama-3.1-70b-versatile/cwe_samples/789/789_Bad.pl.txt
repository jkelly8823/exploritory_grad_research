VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-Bounds Memory Access due to Lack of Input Validation.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet attempts to assign a value to the `$messages` array at an index determined by the `GetUntrustedNumber()` function. This function's name suggests that the returned value comes from an untrusted source and has not been validated for safety. Without proper input validation, this value could be a large number or a negative number, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds memory access error. This could result in unexpected behavior, crashes, or, in some cases, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Recommendations for fixing this vulnerability include validating the output of the `GetUntrustedNumber()` function to ensure it falls within an expected range. This can be done by checking if the returned value is within the bounds of the `$messages` array or by using a different data structure, such as a hash, that does not have bounds.

For example:
```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();
my @messages = ();
if ($num >= 0 && $num <= $#messages) {
    $messages[$num] = "Hello World";
}
```
Alternatively, you could resize the array to fit the index:
```perl
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();
my @messages = ();
$messages[$num] = "Hello World" if $num >= 0;
@messages = (undef) x ($num + 1);
$messages[$num] = "Hello World";
```
However, using a hash would be more suitable if the index is not sequential and its values are not known beforehand.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $num = GetUntrustedNumber();my @messages = ();
                  $messages[$num] = "Hello World";
