VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
SQL Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The `queryString` is directly passed to the `SqlCommand` without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data tampering, unauthorized data access, or even complete control over the database. Although the provided code does not include the source of `queryString`, it is likely that it is derived from user input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

Moreover, the `conn.Connection.Close();` line is incorrect and will cause a compilation error. It should be `conn.Close();` to close the connection.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These methods separate the SQL command from the data and prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. Also, validate and sanitize any user input that is used in the query string.

Example of parameterized query:

```csharp
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = @param", conn);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@param", queryString);
```

Additionally, ensure that all database connections are properly closed in a finally block to prevent connection leaks. It is recommended to use a `using` statement for this purpose.

```csharp
using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString))
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString, conn))
    {
        // Execute query
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```csharp
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);
cmd.Connection = conn;
conn.Open();
SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
HarvestResults(rdr);
conn.Connection.Close();
```
