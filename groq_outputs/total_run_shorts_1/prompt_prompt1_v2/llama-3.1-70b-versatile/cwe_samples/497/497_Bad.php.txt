VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is vulnerable to a command injection attack. Although it is assumed that the `getCurrentUser()` function returns a username that is guaranteed to be alphanumeric, this does not provide sufficient protection against injection attacks. A malicious actor could potentially manipulate the result of the `getCurrentUser()` function or the system itself could encounter an unexpected username format. The username is then concatenated directly into a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary shell commands. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to properly sanitize or escape the username before injecting it into the shell command. Alternatively, the code could be rewritten to avoid using the shell for this operation. One possible solution would be to use the `proc_open` function for more fine-grained control over the process execution, or the `posix` module if more advanced inter-process communication is required. The use of the `escapeshellarg` function can also prevent unintended command injection.

Another option is using Linux `pgrep` or `pkill` commands instead of `ps aux | grep` to get much safer usability of grepping with username (where such a pipe would be mostly useless).

Here's an example of how the code could be modified using the `escapeshellarg` function:
```php
$userName = getCurrentUser();
$command = 'ps aux | grep ' . escapeshellarg($userName);
system($command);
```
Please note that in this context, it would be better if the functions could be compared against different libraries that are mainly developed to be safe themselves, examples include running under 'docker', within custom made VM's (where it's designed safely and better safe than sorry), where you can use any functions to kill all users that ran this bad (potentially 'root') system.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
$userName = getCurrentUser();$command = 'ps aux | grep ' . $userName;system($command);
```
