VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Missing Brackets in Conditional Statement

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a conditional statement with a nested function call. However, it lacks brackets to clearly define the scope of the condition. This can lead to a vulnerability where the second function call `Do_Y()` is executed regardless of the condition, due to the ambiguity in the code structure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be rewritten with brackets to clearly define the scope of the condition. This ensures that only the intended functions are executed based on the condition.

```java
if (condition == true) {
    Do_X();
} 
Do_Y();
```
Alternatively, if the intention is to execute `Do_X()` and `Do_Y()` when the condition is true, the code should be:

```java
if (condition == true) {
    Do_X();
    Do_Y();
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
