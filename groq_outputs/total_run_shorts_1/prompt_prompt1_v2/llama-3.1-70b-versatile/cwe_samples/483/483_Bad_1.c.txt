VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet contains a Non-Obvious Semantics vulnerability due to the use of a missing block for the if statement. 

EXPLANATION:
The if statement in the given code is missing an opening and closing bracket, which can lead to unexpected behavior. In most programming languages, the next statement following an if condition is executed if the condition is true. However, without brackets, the next statement that is executed conditionally is only the first statement directly following the if statement. This can lead to Do_Y() being executed unconditionally. This issue is often not immediately noticeable and can cause difficult-to-debug issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, brackets should be added to clearly specify the statements that are intended to be executed if the condition is true. This can be done by replacing the line with:

if (condition == true) {
  Do_X();
  Do_Y();
}

Alternatively, since only Do_X() should be executed conditionally, and assuming Do_Y() should be executed unconditionally regardless of the condition, the code can be written as:

if (condition == true) {
  Do_X();
}
Do_Y();

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (condition==true) Do_X();Do_Y();
