VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code contains resource management issues, specifically regarding database connections. The code does not properly close the database connection in case of exceptions, and the SqlDataReader is not properly closed. Additionally, the Connection.Close() method is called on the wrong object.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, a database connection is created and opened, but it's not closed properly in case of exceptions. Although the code calls the Close() method, it should be called on the conn object, not conn.Connection. However, a better approach is to use a "using" statement to wrap the database connection and the SqlDataReader to ensure they're closed even if exceptions occur. Furthermore, not closing the SqlDataReader in case of exceptions could lead to resource leaks, impacting system performance.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the issues, it is recommended to use try-finally blocks or, better yet, use the "using" statement to handle resource closure. This ensures resources are properly closed, even in the event of exceptions. 

Here is an example of the recommended code:

```csharp
using (var conn = new SqlConnection(connString))
{
    using (var cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString, conn))
    {
        try
        {
            conn.Open();
            using (var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
            {
                HarvestResults(rdr);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle the exception here
        }
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);cmd.Connection = conn;conn.Open();SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();HarvestResults(rdr);conn.Connection.Close();
