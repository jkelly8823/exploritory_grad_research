VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Uncaught exceptions can potentially leak sensitive information.

EXPLANATION:
The given code catches all exceptions and logs the error. However, it does not rethrow the exception or attempt to close the connection. If an exception occurs while acquiring a connection, the method does not propagate the error, potentially causing unexpected behavior. Furthermore, masking the specific exception type can complicate error diagnosis and debugging.

More critically, if an exception occurs, the error may contain sensitive information, such as database credentials. Logging these details could potentially expose them to unauthorized access, depending on the logging mechanism in place and its configuration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Only catch specific exceptions that your code can handle. In this case, since you are working with a database connection, consider catching `SQLException`.
2. Either rethrow the exception to propagate the error or handle it properly within the catch block. This might include closing the connection, if applicable, and taking other corrective actions as needed.
3. Use a secure logging mechanism that prevents exposure of sensitive information in the error messages.

ORIGINAL CODE:
try {Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);}
catch (Exception e) {log(e);}


Note: Typically, when dealing with Connection and DriverManager, you would also check if the connection is null and close it in a finally block to avoid resource leaks. 

In a more typical implementation, you would do something like this:
```java
Connection con = null;
try {
    con = DriverManager.getConnection(some_connection_string);
    // Perform database operations here
} catch (SQLException e) {
    log(e);
} finally {
    if (con != null) {
        try {
            con.close();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            log(ex);
        }
    }
}
```
