VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks. The query string is not validated or sanitized before being executed.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses a string (`queryString`) to execute a SQL query. However, there is no validation or sanitization of this string to prevent malicious input. This leaves the code vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to execute arbitrary commands on the database.

Furthermore, the `SqlCommand` object is not parameterized, which means that the query string is executed directly on the database without any parameter validation. This makes it easier for an attacker to inject malicious input.

Additionally, the code does not handle exceptions properly. The connection is closed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, which could lead to silent failures and data inconsistencies.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use parameterized queries to execute SQL commands, avoiding direct string execution. This will help to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize user input to ensure that it does not contain malicious SQL code.
3. Implement try-catch blocks to handle exceptions properly, ensuring that connections are closed even in the event of an exception.
4. Use a "using" statement to ensure that the connection is disposed of properly, even if an exception occurs.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```csharp
...SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString);
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(queryString);
cmd.Connection = conn;
conn.Open();
SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
HarvestResults(rdr);
conn.Connection.Close();
...```

Recommended secure version of the code:
```csharp
using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connString))
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = @column", conn))
    {
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@column", userinput);
        try
        {
            conn.Open();
            SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
            HarvestResults(rdr);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // handle exceptions properly
        }
    }
}
```
