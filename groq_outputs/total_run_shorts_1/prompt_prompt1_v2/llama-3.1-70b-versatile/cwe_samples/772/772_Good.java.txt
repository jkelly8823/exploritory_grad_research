VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code is vulnerable to the "Resource Leak Due to an Exception" and also employs 'BufferReader' class by 'FileReader' constructor call, lacking close call is not the primary concern, and when compared with close Filereader still has a risk.

EXPLANATION:
When an exception is thrown while reading from a file using a 'BufferedReader' object, the file remains open as it will not invoke the close() method call on the BufferedReader object or the FileReader object underneath, creating a resource leak. Also, an exception is thrown and will cause memory leak as well.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to use a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the BufferedReader and FileReader objects regardless of whether an exception is thrown. Here is an example of how the vulnerability can be fixed:

```java
private void processFile(string fName) {
    try (BufferedReader fil = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fName))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = fil.readLine()) != null) {
            processLine(line);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // handle the exception
    }
}
```

Additionally, the IOException should be handled properly to prevent resource leaks. Note that in the original code there seem to be several other potential issues like, we should add a method that handles the case when a file does not exist, provide a check that stops it from working with a null or empty file name, add the IOException or an import directive.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
private void processFile(string fName){
    BufferReader fil = new BufferReader(new FileReader(fName));
    String line;
    while ((line = fil.ReadLine()) != null){
        processLine(line);
    }
    fil.Close();
}
```
