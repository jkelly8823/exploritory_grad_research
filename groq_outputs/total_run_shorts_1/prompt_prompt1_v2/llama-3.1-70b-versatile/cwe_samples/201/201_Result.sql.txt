VULNERABLE_LINES: None (context provided, not code)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Plain-text password exposure.

EXPLANATION:
The provided context reveals a plain-text password in the warning message for a database connection attempt. This indicates a significant security vulnerability, as sensitive credentials are being logged or displayed. While no code is explicitly provided, this context hints at insecure practices around password management.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that sensitive credentials like database passwords are stored securely using environment variables or a secrets management system. In addition, any logging mechanisms or error handling should obscure or remove sensitive information before displaying or writing it. Using secure protocols and storage for database connections can also help to minimize potential risks.
