VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 
ORIGINAL CODE reference "connectionStrings" contains insufficient characters to accurately represent the line numbers. However, based on line-by-line inspection, this vulnerability exists on every line of this snippet where it is stated.

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded credentials.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains hardcoded database credentials, including the username ("db2admin") and password ("password"). Hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code introduces significant security risks. If an unauthorized actor gains access to this code, they can also access the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this vulnerability, consider one of the following methods:

1. Environment variables: Store the database credentials as environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the code. This way, they are decoupled from the code and can be easily changed without modifying the application.

2. Configuration files: Store database credentials in a configuration file, which can be encrypted and protected with permissions. Use a configuration provider to load the credentials into your application.

3. Secret management: Use a secret management solution, like Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Cloud Secret Manager, to securely store and manage database credentials.

4. Database authentication methods: Instead of using database credentials directly in the code, consider using database authentication methods like cert-based or Active Directory authentication, which eliminate the need for storing sensitive credentials.
