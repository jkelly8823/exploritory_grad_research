VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a Java serialization issue, but more specifically it is leveraging an old java feature that is typically used as an attack vector.

EXPLANATION:
In Java, classes that extend `java.applet.Applet` or `java.awt.Panel` are treated as Applets in a browser context. This makes the data encapsulated in these objects accessible to attacker apps.

This usage of the Applet is unusual in our modern context, but even more specifically, making a variable that may potentially contain 'user-input' or untrusted data as a class-static puts this data in an object accessible from potentially malicious Java classes.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, consider evaluating what is being stored in the `urls` array and its source.
If the data in the urls are not 'user-inputted' information the risk can be identified as less critical.
However to fully address the potential vulnerability related to 'Applet' usage and data encapsulation, one possible solution:
 
1. Modify this code to a class that does not extend the Applet.
    Create and use instances of URL[] inside the new scope if encapsulated elsewhere and more 'fresh inputting' that ensures data being encapsulated comes from the only trusted input.
No modification below due to data present:


Another issue present here is how data is being defined and added into the urls array
Below fix goes to encapsulate the data in a fresh instance in a fresh scope so no alteration below of original 'code snippet':
 

 ORIGINAL CODE:
 
                  public final class urlTool extends Applet {public final static URL[] urls;...}
