 Information Disclosure Vulnerability: Sensitive Information Exposure

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals a potential vulnerability where sensitive user information, specifically social security numbers and credit card numbers, is being directly output to the user interface without proper encryption or masking. This poses a significant risk of sensitive information exposure, as it could be intercepted by third-party observers or malicious actors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following recommendations should be implemented:

1. Mask or hash sensitive information:Sensitive information such as social security numbers and credit card numbers should be masked or hashed to prevent exposure.
2. Use encryption: Any sensitive information that must be transmitted should be transmitted securely using protocols such as HTTPS.
3. Validate and sanitize user input: All user input should be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential data exposure.
4. Consider data encryption at rest: Store sensitive information encrypted at rest.
