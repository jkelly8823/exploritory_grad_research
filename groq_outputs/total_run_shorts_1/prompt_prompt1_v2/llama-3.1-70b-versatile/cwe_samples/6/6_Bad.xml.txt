VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Session ID Length
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet sets the session ID length to 8 bytes (64 bits), which is considered insecure. A session ID of this length can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks and session fixation. It is recommended to use a longer, randomly generated session ID to prevent such attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Increase the session ID length to at least 16 bytes (128 bits). This can be done by changing the `idLengthBytes` property value to a larger number, such as 16 or 32. Additionally, consider using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate session IDs.
