VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Integer Division by Zero Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet presents a method to calculate the average response time by dividing the total time by the number of requests. However, the code does not validate if the divisor (numRequests) is zero before performing the division. This poses a significant vulnerability as it would lead to an ArithmeticException being thrown when the divisor is zero. In more complex scenarios, this exception could potentially be used to launch a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or even extract sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should validate the divisor before performing the division. One approach is to throw an exception with a descriptive error message if the divisor is zero. Here is a recommended implementation:

```java
public int computeAverageResponseTime(int totalTime, int numRequests) {
    if (numRequests == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Cannot divide by zero. Please ensure the number of requests is greater than zero.");
    }
    return totalTime / numRequests;
}
```

Alternatively, you could consider returning a default value, such as 0 or a special indicator value, when the divisor is zero, depending on the specific requirements of your application.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public int computeAverageResponseTime (int totalTime, int numRequests) {return totalTime / numRequests;}
```
