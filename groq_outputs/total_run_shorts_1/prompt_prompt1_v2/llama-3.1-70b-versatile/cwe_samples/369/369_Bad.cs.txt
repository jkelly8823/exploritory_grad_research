Division by Zero Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The function `Division` does not include any checks for a division by zero error. In programming, division by zero is considered undefined behavior and will often result in a runtime error or unexpected behavior. In languages like C and C++, division by zero can result in a crash or incorrect results. 

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially even execute arbitrary code.

If the dividend and divisor are both integers (as in this case), and if the divisor `y` is zero when passed to the function, it may result in undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should add error checking to ensure that the divisor is not zero before performing the division operation. Here is a revised version of the function that includes this check:
```java
int Division(int x, int y){
    if (y == 0){
        // handle the error or throw an exception
        throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero error");
    } else {
        return x / y;
    }
}
```
Or in a more condensed version:

```java
int Division(int x, int y){
    return (y == 0) ? throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero error") : x / y;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int Division(int x, int y){return (x / y);}
```
