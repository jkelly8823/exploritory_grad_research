VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Insecure Error Handling and Unintended Termination.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet calls System.exit(1) in the catch block, which instantly terminates the application. This could potentially cause unintended behavior in the event of an ApplicationSpecificException, and can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if the exception can be triggered by user input. Additionally, calling logger.error with an exception that is converted to a string using toString() can lead to information exposure, if the exception message contains sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of calling System.exit(1), the application should handle the exception and provide a suitable error response. If the application cannot recover from the exception, it should log the error, clean up any resources that need to be cleaned up, and return an error response to the user.

```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {
        // ...
    } catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught ApplicationSpecificException", ase);
        response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        response.getWriter().print("Internal Server Error");
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
Public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {
        // ...
    } catch (ApplicationSpecificException ase) {
        logger.error("Caught: " + ase.toString());
        System.exit(1);
    }
}
```
