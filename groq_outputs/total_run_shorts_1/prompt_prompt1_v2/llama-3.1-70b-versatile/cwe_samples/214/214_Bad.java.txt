VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The system property "javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword" is used to store the keystore password, which is retrieved into a variable. However, there's no attempt made to clear the keystore password or sensitive data from the variable. 

EXPLANATION:
The retrieved keystore password is stored in the variable "keystorePass" and can remain in memory for an indefinite period. This can increase the chances of sensitive data being exposed through memory dumping or other attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Avoid storing passwords or sensitive data in variables. Use a secure password API that provides methods for securely creating, storing, and retrieving credentials.
2. Consider using a `char[]` instead of a `String` to store sensitive data, and make sure to clear it after use. Strings in Java are immutable and the memory for them is not cleared when they are assigned a new value, but characters arrays can be explicitly cleared. 
3. If storing the password in a variable is unavoidable, at least make sure to clear the variable immediately after its use.

Here's a recommendation for how you might clear sensitive data from the `char[]` variable after it's used:

```java
char[] keystorePass = new char[] {};
try {
    String keystorePassStr = System.getProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword");
    if (keystorePassStr == null) {
        System.err.println("ERROR: Keystore password not specified.");
        System.exit(-1);
    }
    keystorePass = keystorePassStr.toCharArray(); 
    // use keystorePass and then clear it immediately
    Arrays.fill(keystorePass, '0'); 
} finally {
    // Double check that keystorePass is cleared
    Arrays.fill(keystorePass, '0');
}

```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String keystorePass = System.getProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword");
if (keystorePass == null) {
    System.err.println("ERROR: Keystore password not specified.");
    System.exit(-1);
}
```
