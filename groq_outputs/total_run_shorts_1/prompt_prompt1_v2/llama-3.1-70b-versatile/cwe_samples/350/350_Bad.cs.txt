VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks. This occurs when an attacker manipulates DNS responses to masquerade as a trusted website. In this case, the code trusts any host with a domain name ending with "trustme.com" without properly verifying the authenticity of the DNS response.
EXPLANATION:
The code relies on the HostName property of IPHostEntry to determine if the IP address is trusted. However, this property can be manipulated by an attacker through DNS spoofing. This means that an attacker can masquerade as a trusted website and potentially gain unauthorized access. This issue is particularly serious because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication or authorization checks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider using more robust methods for verifying the authenticity of the DNS response, such as:

* Using DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to verify the authenticity of the DNS response.
* Implementing a Trusted DNS resolver that is resistant to DNS spoofing attacks.
* Verifying the certificate of the server against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to ensure the server is who it claims to be.
* Implementing a whitelist of trusted IP addresses instead of relying on DNS names.
ORIGINAL CODE:

 IPAddress hostIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse(RemoteIpAddress);
 IPHostEntry hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(hostIPAddress);
 if (hostInfo.HostName.EndsWith("trustme.com")) {
    trusted = true;
 }
