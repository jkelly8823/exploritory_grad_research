VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability due to strncpy() usage and Unchecked Return Value.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue in the `strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))` call. This is because `sizeof(tHost)` will return the size of the pointer in memory rather than the length of the string it points to. As a result, the function will access beyond the end of the string, potentially leading to undefined behavior.

In addition to that, the return value of `gethostbyaddr()` function is not checked for NULL, which may lead to segmentation faults or null pointer dereferences.

Furthermore, if `hp->h_name` is not null-terminated, `strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))` can go beyond its bounds and read arbitrary memory.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the buffer overflow vulnerability, replace `sizeof(tHost)` with `strlen(tHost)`, which will correctly determine the length of the string. Also, ensure the `hp->h_name` is null-terminated by calling `hp->h_name[hp->h_length] = '\0';`

Additionally, the return value of `gethostbyaddr()` should be checked to prevent null pointer dereference.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
struct hostent *hp;
struct in_addr myaddr;
char* tHost = "trustme.example.com";
myaddr.s_addr=inet_addr(ip_addr_string);
hp = gethostbyaddr((char *) &myaddr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);
if (hp && !strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))) {
  trusted = true;
} else {
  trusted = false;
}
```
