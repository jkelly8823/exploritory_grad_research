VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability through strcpy

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The vulnerability arises from the use of `strcpy` to copy data from `srcBuf` to `destBuf` at an offset calculated by subtracting `destBuf` from `result`. If `srcBuf` is longer than the remaining space in `destBuf` starting from `idx`, it will overflow the buffer. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` and specify the maximum number of characters to copy. This ensures that the buffer is not overflowed.
2. Ensure that `srcBuf` is null-terminated to prevent undefined behavior in case it is longer than expected.
3. Validate the length of `srcBuf` before copying it to `destBuf`. Check that there is enough space in `destBuf` to hold the contents of `srcBuf` plus the null-terminator.
4. Consider using `memcpy` instead of `strcpy` if the goal is to copy a fixed-size buffer rather than a null-terminated string.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int main() {
    ...
    char *result = strstr(destBuf, "Replace Me");
    int idx = result - destBuf;
    strcpy(&destBuf[idx], srcBuf);
    ...
}
```
