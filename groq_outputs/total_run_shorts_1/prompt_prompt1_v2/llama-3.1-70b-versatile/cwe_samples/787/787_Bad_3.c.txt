VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-14, 18-19
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `dst_buf` is allocated with a fixed size (`4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE`), but the loop copies characters from the `user_supplied_string` without checking the length of the output. If the output length exceeds the allocated buffer size, it will cause a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `dst_buf` is allocated with a fixed size, but the loop copies characters from the `user_supplied_string` without checking the length of the output. If the `user_supplied_string` contains multiple '&' or '<' characters, the output length will exceed the allocated buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the code does not check if the `malloc` call succeeds, which can lead to a null pointer dereference.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the following changes are recommended:
1. Check the output length before copying characters to the `dst_buf`. This can be done by keeping a counter of the output length and checking if it exceeds the allocated buffer size.
2. Use a dynamically allocated buffer that can grow as needed, such as a `malloc` call with a dynamically calculated size.
3. Check the return value of the `malloc` call to ensure that it succeeds.
4. Consider using a safer string handling function, such as `snprintf` or `strcpy_s`, that can prevent buffer overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
char * copy_input(char *user_supplied_string){
    int i, dst_index;
    char *dst_buf = (char*)malloc(4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE);
    if ( MAX_SIZE <= strlen(user_supplied_string) ){
        die("user string too long, die evil hacker!");
    }
    dst_index = 0;
    for ( i = 0; i < strlen(user_supplied_string); i++ ){
        if( '&' == user_supplied_string[i] ){
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = '&';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'a';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'm';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'p';
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = ';';
        }else if ('<' == user_supplied_string[i] ){
            /* encode to &lt; */
        }else
            dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];
    }
    return dst_buf;
}
