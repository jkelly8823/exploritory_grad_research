VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The array `id_sequence` is declared to have a size of 3 elements, but the code attempts to access and assign a value to `id_sequence[3]`, which is outside the bounds of the array. This is a classic example of a buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the boundaries of a buffer, potentially causing undefined behavior, crashing the program, or allowing arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the array is not accessed beyond its declared size. If the intention is to store 4 elements, the array should be declared with a size of 4. However, dynamic memory allocation or standard library containers (e.g., `std::vector` in C++) should be considered for a safer and more flexible solution.

```c
int id_sequence[4]; // Increased array size to 4
id_sequence[0] = 123;
id_sequence[1] = 234;
id_sequence[2] = 345;
id_sequence[3] = 456; // Now within bounds
```
Alternatively, use a loop to populate the array and ensure the index does not exceed the array's bounds:
```c
const int sequenceSize = 4;
int id_sequence[sequenceSize]; // Use a named constant for the array size
for (int i = 0; i < sequenceSize; i++) {
    id_sequence[i] = 100 + (i * 111); // Assign values using a loop
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int id_sequence[3];
/* Populate the id array. */
id_sequence[0] = 123;id_sequence[1] = 234;id_sequence[2] = 345;id_sequence[3] = 456;
```
