VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer Overflow

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to a possible subtraction from an unsigned value. If `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns 0 (or a small value), `(returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1)` will result in a large value due to integer underflow. This large value will be used as the length parameter in the `memcpy` function, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

The `returnChunkSize` function claims to return the size of usable memory, but it is unclear how this size relates to the capacity of `destBuf`. Furthermore, if `returnChunkSize` returns -1 to indicate an error, the line `(returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1)` will result in an underflow, and may also lead to a buffer overflow.

Additionally, it's always a good practice to validate and sanitize user input before it reaches memory related operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure `returnChunkSize(destBuf)` returns an accurate value for usable memory size that does not exceed the capacity of `destBuf`.
- Validate the return value of `returnChunkSize` to ensure it does not result in underflow, which will lead to potential buffer overflows.
- Bounds-check the destination buffer `destBuf` and enforce copying limits.

Here's an example of the modified code:
```c
int returnChunkSize(void *) {
    // ...
}

int main() {
    size_t chunkSize = returnChunkSize(destBuf);
    if(chunkSize <= 0 || chunkSize > destBufSize) {
        // handle the error
        return -1;
    }
    memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, std::min(chunkSize-1, destBufSize));
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int returnChunkSize(void *) {
    ...
} int main() {...memcpy(destBuf, srcBuf, (returnChunkSize(destBuf)-1));...}
```
