VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Logs sensitive information that could potentially lead to a security breach or identity theft.

EXPLANATION:
The code logs a user's street address, which is sensitive information. Logging this kind of data can pose a significant risk if the logs are not properly secured or if they are accessed by unauthorized personnel. In the event of a breach, this could lead to identity theft or other malicious activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Do not log sensitive user information such as addresses. Consider using a logging system that anonymizes sensitive data. If the address must be logged for a specific reason, ensure that the logs are properly secured and access is restricted to authorized personnel.

ORIGINAL CODE:
logger.info("User's street address: " + request.getParameter("streetAddress"));

Additional note: It's worth noting that the use of string concatenation in a log statement may also raise concerns about potential log injection attacks. This may not be an immediate vulnerability, but a consideration to keep in mind when designing logging mechanisms. For this reason it is generally better to use parameterized log messages.
