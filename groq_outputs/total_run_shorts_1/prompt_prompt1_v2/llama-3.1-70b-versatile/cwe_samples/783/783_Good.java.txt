VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Division by Zero Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to a division by zero error. If the variable `initialInvestment` is zero, the code will attempt to divide by zero, resulting in a runtime error. This is a serious vulnerability as it can cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that `initialInvestment` is not zero before performing the division. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to handle the case where `initialInvestment` is zero.

```c
if (initialInvestment != 0) {
    returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
} else {
    // Handle the case where initialInvestment is zero
    // This could involve setting a default value for returnROI, 
    // throwing an exception, or logging an error message
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
returnROI = (currentValue - initialInvestment) / initialInvestment;
```
