VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code has a division by zero vulnerability. This occurs when the denominator (in this case, initialInvestment) is zero. Division by zero is undefined and will throw an ArithmeticException in Java.

EXPLANATION:
The code attempts to calculate the return on investment (ROI) by subtracting the initial investment from the current value and then dividing by the initial investment. However, it does not check if the initial investment is zero before performing the division. If the initial investment is zero, this will result in a division by zero error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, a check should be added to handle the case where the initial investment is zero. This can be done by throwing an exception or returning a specific value when the initial investment is zero. Here is an example of how the check can be added:

```java
public double calculateReturnOnInvestment(double currentValue, double initialInvestment) {
    if (initialInvestment == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Initial investment cannot be zero");
    }
    double returnROI = 0.0;
    returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment;
    return returnROI;
}
```

Alternatively, a conditional statement can be used to return a specific value when the initial investment is zero:

```java
public double calculateReturnOnInvestment(double currentValue, double initialInvestment) {
    if (initialInvestment == 0) {
        return Double.NaN;  // or return a specific value
    }
    double returnROI = 0.0;
    returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment;
    return returnROI;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public double calculateReturnOnInvestment(double currentValue, double initialInvestment) {
    double returnROI = 0.0;
    returnROI = currentValue - initialInvestment / initialInvestment;
    return returnROI;
}
```
