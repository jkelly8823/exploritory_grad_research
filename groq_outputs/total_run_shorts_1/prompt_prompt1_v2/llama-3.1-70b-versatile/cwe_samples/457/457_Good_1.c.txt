VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, I found no evidence of vulnerabilities. The code appears to assign a string literal to a char pointer based on a conditional statement. The code then prints the string using printf(). While the fact that the code does not check for null pointer or buffer overflows might raise concerns, in this specific case where the strings are literals, it is not an issue. However, it's worth noting that in a real-world scenario, using variable or user-input data might still introduce vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None needed in this case, but it's always good practice to initialize pointers to avoid potential null pointer dereferences. It's also recommended to always check the return value of printf() (or similar functions) to handle potential errors.
ORIGINAL CODE:
			char *test_string;
			if (i != err_val)
			{
			test_string = "Hello World!";
			}
			else {
			test_string = "Done on the other side!";
			}
			printf("%s", test_string);
