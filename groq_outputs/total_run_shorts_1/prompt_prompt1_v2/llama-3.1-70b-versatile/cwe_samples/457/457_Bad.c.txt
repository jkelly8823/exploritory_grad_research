VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential integer overflow and uncontrolled data copying.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the variables 'aN' and 'bN' in the function call to 'repaint(aN, bN);', but these variables can take on values that may lead to an integer overflow. This is particularly concerning in the 'default' case where 'aN' and 'bN' are assigned a value of '-1'. 

However, the most significant vulnerability appears in lines 2 and 3. Here 'aN' is assigned '0' and 'i' for case '-1' and '0', respectively. Similarly, 'bN' is assigned '0' and '-i'. The use of user-controlled variables like 'i' for both 'aN' and 'bN' could be problematic if this code handles potentially malicious or otherwise arbitrary input.

Assuming that 'NEXT_SZ' and 'i' are user-controlled variables, it is also concerning that they are used in the 'case 1' calculation for 'aN' and 'bN' without any validation or bounds checking. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the input variable 'i' before using it in the assignments for 'aN' and 'bN'. Ensure that it doesn't exceed the maximum value for an integer to prevent integer overflow.
2. Replace the magic number NEXT_SZ with a named constant or a clearly defined variable with proper validation. 
3. Limit the scope and visibility of variables when possible to prevent their accidental use in unintended contexts.   
4. Consider separating data validation from data usage logic for clarity and safety. 


ORIGINAL CODE:
                  int aN, Bn;switch (ctl) {
                        case -1:aN = 0;bN = 0;break;
                           case 0:aN = i;bN = -i;break;
                           case 1:aN = i + NEXT_SZ;bN = i - NEXT_SZ;break;
                           default:aN = -1;aN = -1;break;
                        
                     }repaint(aN, bN);
