VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code has a variable shadowing vulnerability. A local variable with the same name as an existing variable in the same method is declared, leading to potential confusion and incorrect behavior.

EXPLANATION:
In the `displayProductSummary` method, a local variable `productSummary` is declared inside the `try` block with the same name as the variable already declared at the top of the method. This can cause confusion and lead to incorrect behavior if not handled properly. The local variable `productSummary` overshadows the outer variable with the same name, making it inaccessible within the `try` block. This means that the outer variable will not be modified by the assignment inside the `try` block, and the `return` statement at the end of the method will return an empty string.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, remove the local variable declaration inside the `try` block. Instead, assign the result of `getProductSummary(index)` directly to the outer `productSummary` variable. Here is the corrected code:

```java
// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {
        productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:


// Method called from servlet to obtain product information
public String displayProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = new String("");
    try {
        String productSummary = getProductSummary(index);
    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
    return productSummary;
}
public String getProductSummary(int index) {
    String productSummary = "";
    if ((index >= 0) && (index < MAX_PRODUCTS)) {
        productSummary = products[index];
    } else {
        System.err.println("index is out of bounds");
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    return productSummary;
}
