VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Input validation and sanitization vulnerability due to the use of regex replacement without proper validation.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `replaceAll` method to replace all occurrences of the string "script" with the `mask` variable. However, it does not sanitize the `mask` variable. If the `mask` contains special regex characters, it can lead to unintended behavior and could be exploited for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or even Remote Code Execution (RCE).

The code also does not validate the `input` variable. If the `input` contains special regex characters, it can lead to catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, causing performance issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize both the `input` and `mask` variables to ensure they do not contain special regex characters.
2. Use a more specific regex pattern to replace script tags, instead of just replacing the word "script".
3. Consider using a HTML parsing library to remove script tags, rather than relying on regex.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public String removeScriptTags(String input, String mask) {return input.replaceAll("script", mask);}
```
