VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Buffer overflow vulnerability due to incorrect calculation of buffer size.

EXPLANATION:
The bug introduced is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `proc_msg` function. The buffer size calculation in line 6 is incorrect because `pre_len - msg_len` can result in a negative value when `msg_len` is larger than `pre_len`. This happens because `pre_len` is defined as the size of the string "preamble: " (including the null-terminator) while `msg_len` is the actual length of the string excluding the null-terminator. However, the buffer size is defined with a non-constant expression which is not evaluated correctly by the compiler, resulting in undefined behavior. The variables `s` and `msg_len` are passed as parameters, hence the risk of buffer overflow is present.

In the calling function, `s` points to a string that doesn't follow the assumed format, thus `jnklen` has a value that can lead to buffer overflow when used in the `proc_msg` function call.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this bug, calculate the buffer size carefully to ensure that it is always positive and sufficient to hold the string. This can be done by reassessing the way `pre_len` and `msg_len` are defined. It's also crucial to add error checking to handle edge cases. A potential fix is to ensure that the buffer size is always large enough to hold the entire string and that a check is performed on `msg_len` to prevent overflow.

Additionally, consider using a safer string handling function that does bounds checking, such as `strncpy` or `snprintf`, and pass the actual buffer size to prevent overflows.

ORIGINAL CODE:
            int proc_msg(char *s, int msg_len)
            {
                  
		    // Note space at the end of the string - assume all strings have preamble with space
		    int pre_len = sizeof("preamble: ");
		    char buf[pre_len - msg_len];
		    ... Do processing here if we get this far
		  
		  }
		  char *s = "preamble: message\n";
		  char *sl = strchr(s, ':');        // Number of characters up to ':' (not including space)
		  int jnklen = sl == NULL ? 0 : sl - s;    // If undefined pointer, use zero length
		  int ret_val = proc_msg ("s",  jnklen);    // Violate assumption of preamble length, end up with negative value, blow out stack
