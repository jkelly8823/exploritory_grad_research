VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Unchecked deferred closing of HTTP response body when an error occurs.
EXPLANATION:
 The provided code snippet has a deferred call to `response.Body.Close()`, which is intended to ensure that the response body is closed after it's used. However, if an error occurs while sending the request (i.e., `if err != nil`), the function returns before the deferred close is executed. This can lead to resource leaks, as the response body is never closed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that the response body is closed even when an error occurs. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve this:
```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        // Try to close the response body before returning the error.
        if response != nil && response.Body != nil {
            response.Body.Close()
        }
        return nil, err
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
Alternatively, you can also use a closure to close the response body in case of an error:
```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        closeResponseBody(response)
        return nil, err
    }
    defer closeResponseBody(response)
    // ... rest of the function
}

func closeResponseBody(response *http.Response) {
    if response != nil && response.Body != nil {
        response.Body.Close()
    }
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```go
func HandleRequest(client http.Client, request *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    defer response.Body.Close()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
