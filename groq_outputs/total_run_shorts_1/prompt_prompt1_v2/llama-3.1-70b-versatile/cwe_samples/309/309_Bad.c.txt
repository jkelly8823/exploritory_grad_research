VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Password Hashing using SHA-1 and Potential Timing Attack due to equal comparison.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet reveals insecure password handling practices. SHA-1 is used for hashing, which is considered insecure and outdated due to known collision attacks and relatively low computational complexity. SHA-1 should not be used for security purposes, especially password storage. The `equal` comparison for verifying hashed passwords suggests a potential timing attack vulnerability. Comparing two strings for equality in this manner can take longer when the strings have more initial matching characters, leaking information about the correct password.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address the vulnerabilities:
1. Replace SHA-1 with a secure password-hashing algorithm, such as Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to be slow, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.
2. Use a constant-time comparison function to verify the hashed passwords. Many libraries provide secure comparison functions that prevent timing attacks.
3. Ensure that the password is stored securely as a salted hash, with a unique, randomly generated salt value.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    ctext = simple_digest("sha1", plaintext, strlen(plaintext), ...);
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
        login_user();
    }
}
```
