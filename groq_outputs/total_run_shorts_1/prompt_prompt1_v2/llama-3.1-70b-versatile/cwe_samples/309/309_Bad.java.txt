VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of hash function for password storage and potential injection of user input into cryptographic operations.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the SHA hash function to store and verify passwords. However, this approach has several security issues. Firstly, using a non-cryptographic hash function like SHA for password storage is insecure as it can be easily brute-forced by an attacker. Additionally, the use of `new String(plainTextIn)` could potentially introduce an injection vulnerability if `plainTextIn` is user-controlled. Furthermore, the code uses `encer` as a MessageDigest but tries to call `digest()` on `password`, which seems to be an uninitialized object. Also, the function `equal()` and `secret_password()` are not defined in the provided code snippet, but if they are not properly implemented, they could also introduce security vulnerabilities.

Moreover, there is no authentication mechanism provided for `login_user()` function. This implies that after validation if the credentials match it is logging the user in, even though based on the snippet nothing provides evidence of validation otherwise.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Use a secure password hashing algorithm such as BCrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement secure comparison of stored and input hashes using a secure compare function like `MessageDigest.isEqual()`.
- Initialize the `password` object before calling `digest()` on it.
- Validate the authenticity of the `login_user()` call to prevent potential unauthorized access.
- Ensure `equal()` and `secret_password()` functions are securely implemented.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {login_user();}
```
