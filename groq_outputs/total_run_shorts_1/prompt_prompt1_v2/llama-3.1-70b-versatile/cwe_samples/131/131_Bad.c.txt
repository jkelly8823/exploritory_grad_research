VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to a lack of bounds checking on the `WidgetList` array.

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates memory for `numWidgets` pointers to `Widget` objects, but then assigns a value to `WidgetList[numWidgets]`, which is out of bounds of the allocated array. This can cause memory corruption and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, `GetUntrustedSizeValue()` is assumed to return an untrusted value, which means it can be subjected to manipulation by an attacker.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the loop should be changed to ensure it does not assign a value to `WidgetList[numWidgets]`, which is out of bounds of the allocated array. Also, the `numWidgets` variable should be validated before using it, to ensure it does not exceed the maximum allowed value.

Here's a possible fix:

```c
int i;
unsigned int numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();
if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {
    ExitError("Incorrect number of widgets requested!");
}
Widget **WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc((numWidgets) * sizeof(Widget *));
printf("WidgetList ptr=%p\n", WidgetList);
for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {
    WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();
}
// avoid out of bounds assignment
WidgetList = realloc(WidgetList, (numWidgets + 1) * sizeof(Widget *));
WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;
showWidgets(WidgetList);
```

Alternatively, the null-terminated assignment can be avoided altogether and instead consider alternative ways to track the array length.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
int i;unsigned int numWidgets;Widget **WidgetList;
numWidgets = GetUntrustedSizeValue();if ((numWidgets == 0) || (numWidgets > MAX_NUM_WIDGETS)) {ExitError("Incorrect number of widgets requested!");}WidgetList = (Widget **)malloc(numWidgets * sizeof(Widget *));printf("WidgetList ptr=%p\n", WidgetList);for(i=0; i<numWidgets; i++) {WidgetList[i] = InitializeWidget();}WidgetList[numWidgets] = NULL;showWidgets(WidgetList);
```
