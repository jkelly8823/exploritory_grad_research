VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of dynamically allocated memory without error handling and validation of the allocation size.

EXPLANATION:
The code dynamically allocates memory using `malloc` without checking if the allocation was successful. This can lead to a dangling pointer if `malloc` fails to allocate the requested amount of memory. Additionally, the allocation size is variable (`sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs`), which could potentially lead to an integer overflow if `num_imgs` is very large.

Furthermore, it appears that the allocation size is calculated based on the return value of the `get_num_imgs` function. If this function returns an unvalidated or unsanitized value, it could potentially lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to:

1. Check the return value of `malloc` to ensure that the allocation was successful. If `malloc` fails, it will return `NULL`.
2. Validate the return value of `get_num_imgs` to prevent potential integer overflows.
3. Consider using a more robust memory allocation library or function, such as `calloc`, that allows for better error handling.
4. Consider using a static analysis tool to identify and prevent potential buffer overflows.

Here is an example of how to implement these recommendations:

```c
img_t* table_ptr;
int num_imgs;

num_imgs = get_num_imgs();
if (num_imgs > 0 && num_imgs <= MAX_IMAGES) {
    table_ptr = malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);
    if (table_ptr == NULL) {
        // handle allocation failure
    }
} else {
    // handle invalid num_imgs
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
img_t table_ptr; /*struct containing img data, 10kB each*/int num_imgs;...
num_imgs = get_num_imgs();table_ptr = (img_t*)malloc(sizeof(img_t)*num_imgs);...
```
