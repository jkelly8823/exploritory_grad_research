VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Dynamic Link Library (DLL) Hijacking Vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code loads a dynamic link library (DLL) named "library.dll" using `System.loadLibrary()`. However, the path to the DLL is not specified. This is a vulnerability because an attacker can create a malicious DLL with the same name and place it in a directory that is searched by the system before the legitimate DLL. When the system loads the DLL, it will load the malicious one instead, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, specify the full path to the DLL when loading it using `System.loadLibrary()`. This will prevent the system from searching for the DLL in other directories and reduce the risk of loading a malicious DLL. 

Alternatively, consider using a relative path to the DLL if it is located in a trusted directory, and use a secure method to verify the integrity of the DLL before loading it.

ORIGINAL CODE:
System.loadLibrary("library.dll");
