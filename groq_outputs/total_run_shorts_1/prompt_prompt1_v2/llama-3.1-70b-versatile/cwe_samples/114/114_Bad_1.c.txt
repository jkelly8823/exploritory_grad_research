VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Dynamic Link Library (DLL) Injection via Unsecured Load of a DLL
EXPLANATION:
This code segment uses the `LoadLibrary` function to load a DLL file named "liberty.dll" into memory. The `LoadLibrary` function does not perform any validation of the DLL's integrity or origin before loading it. This could lead to a DLL hijacking vulnerability, where a malicious actor replaces the DLL with a file of their own, potentially executing malicious code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a hash-based integrity check (such as a digital signature or checksum verification) to ensure the DLL has not been tampered with.
- Load DLLs from secure locations using the absolute path, to avoid path traversal issues.
- Use a white list of allowed DLLs and ensure the DLL is from that list before loading.
- Consider using a combination of secure hash functions such as sha256 or higher.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                LoadLibrary("liberty.dll");
