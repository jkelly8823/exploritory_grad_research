VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Direct Object Reference (DOR) vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to access sensitive data.
EXPLANATION:
The code retrieves a user's record from a database using the `getUserRecord()` function, which is called with a username parameter obtained from the `$_GET` superglobal. The code then either loops through the record's fields or directly outputs the record as JSON. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the username provided by the user, allowing an attacker to attempt to access another user's record by modifying the `$_GET['user']` parameter. This could potentially expose sensitive data.
Additionally, the code also appears to be vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), which can allow an attacker to access or manipulate data that they should not have access to.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the username input obtained from `$_GET['user']`.
2. Ensure that the `getUserRecord()` function checks user permissions and access control before returning a user's record.
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
4. Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
// API flag, output JSON if set
$json = $_GET['json'];
$username = $_GET['user'];
if(!$json){
    $record = getUserRecord($username);
    foreach($record as $fieldName => $fieldValue){
        if($fieldName == "email_address") {
            // skip displaying user emails
            continue;
        }else{
            writeToHtmlPage($fieldName,$fieldValue);
        }
    }
}else{
    $record = getUserRecord($username);
    echo json_encode($record);
}
```
