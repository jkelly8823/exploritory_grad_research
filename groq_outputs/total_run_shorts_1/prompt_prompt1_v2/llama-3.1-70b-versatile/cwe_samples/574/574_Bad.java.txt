VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of synchronized methods with getter methods that do not have synchronized access, potentially leading to a data inconsistency or visibility issue due to unsynchronized access.

EXPLANATION:
I have identified a potential vulnerability in the provided code snippet. The issue arises from the inconsistent use of synchronized methods. The setter methods for `id`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are all marked as `synchronized`, indicating an intention to protect against concurrent modifications. However, the corresponding getter methods are not synchronized. This can lead to visibility issues or inconsistent data access, as unsynchronized getter methods may access stale or partially updated data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the getter methods should also be synchronized to ensure data consistency and thread safety. The corrected methods would look like this:
```java
public synchronized String getCustomerId() {...}
public synchronized String getFirstName() {...}
public synchronized String getLastName() {...}
```
Alternatively, other synchronization mechanisms like `ReentrantLock` or `AtomicReference` can be used, but that would likely involve a more substantial refactor.

ORIGINAL CODE:
@Entity
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    // ...
    public synchronized void setCustomerId(String id) {...}
    public String getCustomerId() {...}
    public synchronized void setFirstName(String firstName) {...}
    public String getFirstName() {...}
    public synchronized void setLastName(String lastName) {...}
    public String getLastName() {...}
    // ...
}
