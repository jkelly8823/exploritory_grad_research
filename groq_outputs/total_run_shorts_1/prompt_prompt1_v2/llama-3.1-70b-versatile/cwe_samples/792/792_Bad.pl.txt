VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This code is vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The input provided by `GetUntrustedInput()` is used to construct a path, which is then used to read and send a file. While the code attempts to sanitize the input by removing '../', it only removes '../' from the beginning of the string, not from the middle. This allows an attacker to bypass the sanitization by providing a path like '.../../../etc/passwd'. 

Furthermore, merely removing '../' from a string is insufficient to ensure that the resulting string is a safe file path. A more secure approach is needed to prevent directory traversal attacks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats. 
2. Consider using an existing library or function to sanitize and normalize file paths.
3. Implement whitelisting: only allow a specific set of predefined file paths or directories to be accessed.
4. If possible, avoid directly concatenating user input into file paths.
5. Ideally, implement a separate authentication or authorization mechanism to control access to files.

ORIGINAL CODE:
my $Username = GetUntrustedInput();$Username =~ s/\.\.\///;my $filename = "/home/user/" . $Username;ReadAndSendFile($filename);
