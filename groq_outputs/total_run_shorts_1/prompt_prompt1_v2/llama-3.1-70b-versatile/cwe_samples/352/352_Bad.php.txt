VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Remote Code Execution through Use of Unvalidated User Input

EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet displays a clear example of unvalidated user input being used directly in a database update function (SendUpdateToDatabase). The function is using the '$_POST['email']' directly without any form of validation. This creates a vulnerability for SQL injection attacks. Attackers can manipulate the 'email' data to inject malicious SQL code.

Additionally, the 'update_profile' function is declared with no parentheses which is not proper function declaration, but its not directly contributing to this vulnerability.

The 'SendUpdateToDatabase' is not provided in the provided snippet of code, which, if vulnerable, would contribute to the present vulnerability and make it more severe.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
2. Validate and sanitize all user input before passing it to a database query.
3. Use parameterized queries to escape any special characters and validate them.

Here's an example of how this can be done:

```php
function update_profile() {
    $email = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'email', FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
    if ($email !== false) {
        SendUpdateToDatabase($_SESSION['username'], $email);
        echo "Your profile has been successfully updated.";
    } else {
        echo "Invalid email provided.";
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
// initiate the session in order to validate sessions
session_start();

//if the session is registered to a valid user then allow update

if (! session_is_registered("username")) {
   
       echo "invalid session detected!";

       // Redirect user to login page
       [...]
       exit;
}

// The user session is valid, so process the request

// and update the information

update_profile();
function update_profile {
        
       
       // read in the data from $POST and send an update
       

       // to the database
       SendUpdateToDatabase($_SESSION['username'], $_POST['email']);[...]echo "Your profile has been successfully updated.";
}
```
