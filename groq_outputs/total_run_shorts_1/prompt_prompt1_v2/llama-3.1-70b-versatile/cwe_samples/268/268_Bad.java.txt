VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Privilege escalation vulnerability in password reset functionality.

EXPLANATION:
The `resetPassword` function allows users to reset another user's password. However, the function does not properly enforce role-based access control. Although the function checks if the requesting user is authenticated and has the necessary role to perform the command, the role-hierarchy check is incomplete. There is a clear intention to allow only certain roles (e.g., ADMIN and OPERATOR) to perform this action, but due to the inadequate role-hierarchy check, the function is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The current implementation does not prevent other roles from executing the `setPassword` function if they manage to circumvent the role-hierarchy check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add proper role-hierarchy checks. This should include checking if the requesting user's role is within a predefined hierarchy that is allowed to reset passwords of other users.
- Refine the allowed role(s) for this action and explicitly specify them in the code to avoid confusion and mistakes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public enum Roles {ADMIN,OPERATOR,USER,GUEST}
public void resetPassword(User requestingUser, User user, String password ){
    if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
        switch(requestingUser.role){
            case GUEST:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
            case USER:System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");break;
            default:setPassword(user,password);break;}
    }
    else{System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");}
}
```
