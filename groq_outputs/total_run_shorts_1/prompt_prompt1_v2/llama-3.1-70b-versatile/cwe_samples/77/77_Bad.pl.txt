VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Command Injection vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable because it constructs a system command directly from user input using the $fname variable. This variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. The validate_name function checks if the input name only contains word characters and hyphens, but this does not prevent malicious input from being injected into the system command.

The directory listing command `/bin/ls -l $fname` is vulnerable to injection attacks. An attacker can manipulate the $fname variable to inject additional system commands or arguments, potentially leading to code execution, file system access, or other security breaches.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerability, use the `system` command with multiple arguments instead of a single string argument. This allows Perl to properly handle the arguments and prevents command injection. Also, consider using a more robust validation function or a library specifically designed for handling file paths and names.

Here's an example of the fixed code:
```perl
my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
do_listing($arg);

sub do_listing {
  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {
    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;
  }

  my @cmd = ("/bin/ls", "-l", $fname);
  system(@cmd);
}

# No changes to the validate_name subroutine
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my $arg = GetArgument("filename");
do_listing($arg);

sub do_listing {
  my($fname) = @_;
  if (! validate_name($fname)) {
  
    print "Error: name is not well-formed!\n";
    return;
  
  }
  # build command
  my $cmd = "/bin/ls -l $fname";
  system($cmd);
}

sub validate_name {
  
  my($name) = @_;
  if ($name =~ /^[\w\-]+$/) {
  
    return(1);
  
  }
  else {
  
    return(0);
  
  }
}
```
