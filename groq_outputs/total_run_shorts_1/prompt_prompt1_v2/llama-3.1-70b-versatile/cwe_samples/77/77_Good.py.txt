VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure use of regular expression which can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) due to catastrophic backtracking.

EXPLANATION: 
The regular expression `^CWE-\d+$` can lead to catastrophic backtracking for certain inputs. This regex can cause the regex engine to work excessively hard to match, leading to a potential Denial of Service.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Use possessive quantifiers (`++`, `*+`, `++`, etc.) or atomic groups (`(?>)`) to prevent backtracking in the regex. Also, consider using a library that provides match timeout or tries to mitigate this vulnerability.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
cweRegex = re.compile("^CWE-\d+$")
match1 = cweRegex.search(arg1)
match2 = cweRegex.search(arg2)
if match1 is None or match2 is None:
    # throw exception, generate error, etc.
prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(arg1, arg2)
...
```

However, another vulnerability stands out:
Insecure string formatting can lead to injection attacks.

VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure string formatting can lead to injection attacks.

EXPLANATION: 
The `format` function is being used with user controlled input `arg1` and `arg2` directly in a format string. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the `prompt` variable.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Use positional arguments or keyword arguments for format function, never directly insert untrusted input into the format string.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```python
prompt = "Explain the difference between {} and {}".format(arg1, arg2)
```
