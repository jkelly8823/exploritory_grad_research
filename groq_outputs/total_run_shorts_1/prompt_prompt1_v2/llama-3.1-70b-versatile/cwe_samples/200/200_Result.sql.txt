VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Hardcoded Credential and Insecure Database Connection.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is generating a warning message indicating that the database connection using the default 'root' user with a password 'N1nj4' has failed. Although this snippet does not contain actual code, the warning message indicates that the credentials and connection details are hardcoded and potentially hardcoded in the `database.inc` file mentioned in the warning message. Furthermore, using the default 'root' user for a database connection can be insecure. A potential attacker who gains access to the file containing these hardcoded credentials could exploit this vulnerability to access the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use environment variables or secure configuration files to store database credentials, rather than hardcoding them directly into the code.
- Consider implementing a secure authentication mechanism, such as OAuth or federation with a trusted identity provider, to manage database access.
- Avoid using the default 'root' user and instead create a new database user with limited permissions to interact with the database.

ORIGINAL CODE:
Warning: mysql_pconnect(): Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: N1nj4) in /usr/local/www/wi-data/includes/database.inc on line 4
