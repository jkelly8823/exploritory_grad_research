VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Insecure Data Display vulnerability. The code snippet appears to display sensitive user data, namely Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and Credit Card Numbers (CCNs), in plaintext.

EXPLANATION:
The presence of sensitive user data being output directly from the application is a significant security concern. This code snippet indicates that user IDs are being displayed in plaintext, which poses significant risks. An attacker with access to the output could exploit this data, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, we recommend:
1. **Never store sensitive data in plaintext**: Ensure that sensitive data is stored securely, such as by using encryption or tokenization, and that access controls are in place to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
2. **Use display masking**: Instead of displaying the full sensitive data, use display masking to obfuscate the majority of the data. For example, display only the last few digits of the SSN or CCN.
3. **Implement secure data storage and transmission**: Store sensitive data securely, using secure protocols such as HTTPS, and implement measures to prevent sensitive data from being transmitted or stored in plaintext.

Social Security Number: <%= ssn %></br>Credit Card Number: <%= ccn %>
