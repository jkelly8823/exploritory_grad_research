VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability and potential SQL Injection/ NoSQL injection vulnerability through param() function usage.

EXPLANATION:
The param() function in Perl is used to receive input from a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) request. However, the code provided does not validate or sanitize user input before passing it to other functions (IsValidUsername() and IsValidPassword()). An attacker may craft malicious inputs to exploit these vulnerabilities. Specifically, SQL Injection or NoSQL injection vulnerabilities may arise if the IsValidUsername() and IsValidPassword() functions pass unsanitized input directly to a database query.

Additionally, the print statements might also reveal more information about the potential vulnerabilities. For example, if an attacker enters an incorrect password for a valid username, the application will indicate that the username exists.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate potential vulnerabilities, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Sanitize and validate** user input as soon as it's received. In this case, before passing $username and $password to IsValidUsername() and IsValidPassword(), implement checks to ensure the inputs meet expected formats and size limits.

2. **Use prepared statements** in the IsValidUsername() and IsValidPassword() functions to protect against SQL injection. Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the data.

3. **Use a secure authentication mechanism** such as the ones provided by a web framework (e.g., CGI::LoginManager or Authen::Simple::WebForm).

4. **Handle authentication failures securely** to prevent information disclosure. Instead of revealing whether a password is incorrect or the username is unknown, provide a generic authentication failure message.

ORIGINAL CODE:


my $username = param('username');
my $password = param('password');

if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1) {
    if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1) {
        print "Login Successful";
    } else {
        print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
    }
} else {
    print "Login Failed - unknown username";
}
