VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Sensitive Information Exposure
EXPLANATION:
The potential vulnerability in this code snippet is the exposure of sensitive information in the error message. The script is echoing the location of the MySQL configuration file, which could potentially contain sensitive database credentials. In the event of an exception, the location of the file is printed, which an attacker could exploit to gain access to the file and, by extension, the database credentials. Furthermore, the exception message is also being echoed, which could contain additional sensitive information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of directly echoing sensitive information, consider using a logging mechanism to record exceptions in a secure location, such as a log file or a centralized logging service. Limit the information returned to the user to a simple error message that does not disclose sensitive details.

Modified Code:

```php
// Using a logging mechanism
try {openDbConnection();}
catch (Exception $e) {
    // Log the error with sensitive information
    error_log('Caught exception: ' . $e->getMessage() . ' Check credentials in config file at: ' . $Mysql_config_location);
    // Return a generic error message to the user
    echo 'An error occurred. Please check the logs for details.';
}

// Alternatively, without a logging mechanism
try {openDbConnection();}
catch (Exception $e) {
    // Log the error to a file
    file_put_contents('error.log', 'Caught exception: ' . $e->getMessage() . ' Check credentials in config file at: ' . $Mysql_config_location);
    // Return a generic error message to the user
    echo 'An error occurred.';
}

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  try {openDbConnection();}
                     //print exception message that includes exception message and configuration file location
                     catch (Exception $e) {echo 'Caught exception: ', $e->getMessage(), '\n';echo 'Check credentials in config file at: ', $Mysql_config_location, '\n';}
