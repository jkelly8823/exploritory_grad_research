VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate Error Handling and Information Disclosure
EXPLANATION:
The catch block catches all types of exceptions and displays a generic error message to the user. However, this approach can lead to information disclosure. The error message does not provide sufficient details about the exception, making it harder for developers to diagnose and fix issues.

Moreover, the error message is quite generic and does not convey any meaningful information about the cause of the error. In some cases, this approach can also be used to expose internal implementation details or system configuration information. Furthermore, exceptions usually contain useful information that can help developers identify and fix issues. By not providing this information, you're making it harder for yourself to identify and fix the issue quickly.

Finally, displaying exceptions or raw error messages can reveal security-sensitive information to an attacker, making it easier for them to plan and execute attacks. It's essential to display more general error messages to users while logging exception details securely for later analysis.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  **Separate logging and user messages**: Instead of showing raw exception information to users, provide a general, human-readable error message. This will make your application less likely to reveal security-sensitive information.

    ```java
catch (Exception e) {
    // Log exception details, but avoid displaying sensitive information to users
    Log.e("ExampleActivity", "Caught exception while on user:", e);
    // Display a user-friendly error message
    AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
    builder.setMessage("Sorry, an unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.");
    AlertDialog alert = builder.create();
    alert.show();
}
```

    OR
   If you are within a system doing critical production tasks you would likely never provide the user an alert dialog where the exception is provided as described in the above code.  You would log the information and end the task or divert to a new state.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
locationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);locationClient.connect();currentUser.setLocation(locationClient.getLastLocation());
                     ...
                     catch (Exception e) {AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);builder.setMessage("Sorry, this application has experienced an error.");AlertDialog alert = builder.create();alert.show();Log.e("ExampleActivity", "Caught exception: " + e + " While on User:" + User.toString());}
```
