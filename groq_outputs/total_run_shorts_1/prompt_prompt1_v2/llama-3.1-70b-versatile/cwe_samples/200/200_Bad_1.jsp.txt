VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or more likely an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability due to the exposure of sensitive user data.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet suggests that it is part of a web application that displays user information. The presence of the 'acctNo' variable being directly outputted to the user interface raises concerns. This exposed data appears to be a user's account number, which could be a sensitive piece of information. A malicious actor could potentially use this information to engage in further unauthorized activity.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that sensitive user data is kept confidential and not exposed directly to the user interface.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization controls to verify the user's access levels before displaying sensitive data.
- Hash or encrypt the 'acctNo' variable before storing it, if it must be stored at all. Avoid transmitting it in plain text or displaying it directly to users.
- Review the application's data handling practices to identify potential data leaks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  <% if (Boolean.getBoolean("debugEnabled")) {
                        %>User account number: <%= acctNo %><%} %>
