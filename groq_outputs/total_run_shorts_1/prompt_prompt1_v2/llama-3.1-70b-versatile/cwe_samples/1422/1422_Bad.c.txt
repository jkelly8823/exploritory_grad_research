VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Out-of-bounds array access and buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided contains a potential out-of-bounds array access and buffer overflow vulnerability. In the function `call_victim`, an untrusted argument `untrusted_arg` is copied to `arg_copy`. On the next line, `**trusted_ptr * 4096` is used as an index to access an array. The multiplication of `**trusted_ptr` by 4096 may result in an index that is out of the bounds of the array `array`. 

Additionally, it appears that the intention of the code is to index into `array` with a pointer (or integer) value that is multiplied by the page size (4096), which is a common pattern in memory-based vulnerabilities. However, if `**trusted_ptr` is not properly validated, this could lead to an out-of-bounds access or even a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate `untrusted_arg` before using it to prevent malicious input.
2. Validate `**trusted_ptr` before using it as an array index to prevent out-of-bounds access or buffer overflow.
3. Ensure that `array` is large enough to accommodate the maximum possible index value.
4. Consider using a safer data structure, such as a `std::vector`, which provides bounds checking and can prevent buffer overflow.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
void call_victim(size_t untrusted_arg) {
    *arg_copy = untrusted_arg;
    array[**trusted_ptr * 4096];
}
