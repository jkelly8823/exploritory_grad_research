VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The use of a static key for encryption, combined with a predictable encryption algorithm and mode, makes the encrypted password susceptible to unauthorized decryption.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code uses the MCrypt library, which is deprecated and removed in PHP 7.2. However, the primary concern is the use of a static key for encryption and an ECB mode, which is not recommended for secure encryption. 

ECB mode does not provide any diffusion, making it vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack. Furthermore, using a static key exposes the encrypted password to unauthorized decryption, especially if the encryption key becomes known to attackers.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using a secure encryption algorithm such as AES, combined with a recommended mode of operation like CBC or GCM, and a secure key derivation process. It is also recommended to use a secure random initialization vector for each encryption operation.

1. Update to use a secure encryption library and algorithm, such as OpenSSL with AES-256-CBC or AES-256-GCM.
2. Derive the encryption key securely from a strong user-provided password or a secure key store.
3. Use a secure random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation.
4. Avoid using static keys and passwords for encryption.

Here's a basic example of how the function could be modified to use a secure encryption algorithm:

```php
function encryptPassword($password, $key) {
    $encryptedPassword = openssl_encrypt(
        $password,
        'AES-256-CBC',
        hash('sha256', $key, true),
        OPENSSL_RAW_DATA,
        openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(openssl_cipher_iv_length('AES-256-CBC'))
    );
    return $encryptedPassword;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```php
function encryptPassword($password){
    $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_DES, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
    $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
    $key = "This is a password encryption key";
    $encryptedPassword = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_DES, $key, $password, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv);
    return $encryptedPassword;
}
```
