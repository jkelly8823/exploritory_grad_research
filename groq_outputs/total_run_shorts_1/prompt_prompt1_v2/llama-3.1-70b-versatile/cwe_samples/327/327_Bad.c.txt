VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of an insecure encryption algorithm. 
EXPLANATION:
The code uses the EVP_des_ecb function, which is likely a reference to the DES algorithm in ECB mode, a widely considered insecure encryption algorithm due to its short key length (56 bits) and vulnerability to certain types of attacks such as differential cryptanalysis. ECB mode specifically is also insecure due to the fact that it does not include any form of authentication or message integrity. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To resolve this vulnerability, consider using a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES with a sufficient key size (at least 128 bits) and a secure mode of operation (e.g., GCM or CBC with HMAC). Ensure proper authentication and message integrity are included.
ORIGINAL CODE:
EVP_des_ecb();
