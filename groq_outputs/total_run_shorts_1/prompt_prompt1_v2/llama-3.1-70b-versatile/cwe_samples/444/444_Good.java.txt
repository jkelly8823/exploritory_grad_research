VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-17
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The code does not properly handle invalid or malicious HTTP requests. Specifically, it only checks for the presence of multiple Content-Length headers but does not verify the consistency or validity of their values. This could lead to potential vulnerabilities such as HTTP request smuggling attacks.

EXPLANATION:
 Although the code attempts to check for multiple Content-Length headers, it does not handle cases where these headers have different values. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the request by providing two valid Content-Length headers with different values, potentially resulting in an HTTP request smuggling attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  In addition to checking for multiple Content-Length headers, the code should also verify that the values of these headers are consistent.
2.  When invalid or inconsistent headers are detected, the code should reject the request and return an error response.
3.  It is also recommended to consider using a library or framework that provides built-in support for handling HTTP requests, as these libraries typically include robust security features to prevent such attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:


                  protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
				  
                    
                      
                      // Set up response writer object
                      ...try {
					  
						
                          // check for multiple content length headers
                          Enumeration contentLengthHeaders = request.getHeaders("Content-Length");
						  int count = 0;
						  while (contentLengthHeaders.hasMoreElements()) {
						  count++;
						  }
						  if (count > 1) {
						  
							// output error response
							}
							else {
							
							  
								// process request
							  
							  }
							  
                        
                    } catch (Exception ex) {...}
					}
