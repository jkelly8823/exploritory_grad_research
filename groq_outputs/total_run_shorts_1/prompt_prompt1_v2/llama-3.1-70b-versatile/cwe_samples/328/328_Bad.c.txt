VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code is vulnerable to timing attacks.

EXPLANATION: 
The "equal" function used to compare the hashed passwords is not secure. It likely compares the two strings byte by byte and stops as soon as it finds a mismatch. An attacker can use the time it takes for the comparison to fail to deduce information about the password. This is known as a timing attack.

The issue is compounded by the fact that SHA-1, a relatively slow hash function, is used to hash the plaintext password, and then this hash is compared using an insecure method.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent timing attacks, use a secure comparison function, such as a constant-time comparison function. This function should compare the two strings in a way that always takes the same amount of time, regardless of the contents of the strings.

Here is a revised version of the function that uses constant-time comparison:
 
```c
#include <string.h>

// Function to securely compare two buffers
int compare_buffers(const void *b1, size_t len1, const void *b2, size_t len2) {
    int result = (len1 != len2);
    if (!result) {
        const unsigned char *u1 = b1;
        const unsigned char *u2 = b2;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < len1; i++) {
            result |= u1[i] ^ u2[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
    // ... calculate ctext as before ...

    // Use a secure comparison function
    if (compare_buffers(ctext, SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH, secret_password(), SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH) == 0) {
        login_user();
    }
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
    //Login if hash matches stored hash
    if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {login_user();}
}
```
