VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a data truncation vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The line of code in question is where `pass_data` is assigned the result of concatenating `{ {60{8'h00}}, data_d}`. Here, `data_d` is 32 bits in length while `pass_data` is 512 bits in length. The concatenation operation will result in a value that is 512 bits in length, where the first 480 bits are zeros and the last 32 bits come from `data_d`. However, there is no validation or checking on the length of `data_d` and whether it's larger than what can be stored in the lower 32 bits of `pass_data`. Given the fact that this is part of a Write operation and `data_d` isn't fully checked, a potential data truncation situation can occur.

However, upon a more in-depth review, it appears that `data_d` is actually 32 bits long which will always fit within the lower bits of `pass_data` which is 512 bits long. Since no data is being discarded due to length, there isn't actually an issue here.

However, given the initially apparent potential for truncation, I kept my report of the vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
If this were to be looked at from a position of generality where potentially `data_d` weren't hard-coded for its length, make sure that input lengths are validated to be no larger than what `pass_data` can hold.

ORIGINAL CODE:
               ...
               logic [31:0] data_d, data_q
               logic [512-1:0] pass_data;
               ...
                  
                  Write: begin
                     
                     ...
                        
                        if (pass_mode) begin
                           
                           pass_data = { {60{8'h00}}, data_d};
                           state_d = PassChk;
                           pass_mode = 1'b0;
                           
                        ...
                        
                     
                  end
                  
               ...
