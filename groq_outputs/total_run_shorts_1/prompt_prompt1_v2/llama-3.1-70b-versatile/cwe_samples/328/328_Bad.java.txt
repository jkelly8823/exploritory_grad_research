VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Password Hashing and Comparison

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet demonstrates multiple security concerns. Firstly, the password hashing algorithm used is SHA, which is not suitable for password storage. SHA is a fast hashing algorithm that can be easily brute-forced with modern hardware. Additionally, the code is using the `MessageDigest` instance incorrectly. The `digest` variable seems to be calling `digest()` on `password` instead of `encer`, which is the correct instance. Furthermore, the comparison of the hashed passwords using the `equal` method is also insecure, as it may be vulnerable to timing attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these vulnerabilities, we recommend the following:
- Use a password hashing algorithm like Argon2, PBKDF2, or Bcrypt, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.
- Use the correct `MessageDigest` instance (`encer`) to generate the digest.
- Use a secure string comparison method like `java.util.Arrays.equals()` or `java.security.MessageDigest.isEqual()` to compare the hashed passwords. This will prevent timing attacks.
- Consider using a library like OWASP's ESAPI or Apache Shiro that provides secure password hashing and comparison functionality.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
encer.update(plainTextIn);
byte[] digest = password.digest();
//Login if hash matches stored hash
if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {
    login_user();
}
```

Example of secure password hashing using PBKDF2:
```java
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException;
import java.security.spec.KeySpec;
import javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory;
import javax.crypto.spec.PBEKeySpec;

public class PasswordHasher {
    private static final int ITERATIONS = 1000;
    private static final int KEY_LENGTH = 128;

    public static byte[] hashPassword(String password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
        SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
        byte[] salt = new byte[16];
        random.nextBytes(salt);

        KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, ITERATIONS, KEY_LENGTH);
        SecretKeyFactory f = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
        byte[] hash = f.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();

        return hash;
    }
}
```
