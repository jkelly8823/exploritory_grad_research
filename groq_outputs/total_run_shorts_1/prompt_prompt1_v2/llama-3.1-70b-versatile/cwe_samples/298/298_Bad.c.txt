VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability due to the improper use of the assignment operator (=) in the if condition, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The line `if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` contains an assignment operation, not a comparison. In C and similar languages, the assignment operator (=) is often a single equals sign. The code is assigning the result of `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` to `cert` instead of comparing it. This is a common error and can be exploited by an attacker. As a result, the if condition will always evaluate to true and the code will always execute, regardless of the value of `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the comparison operator (==) should be used instead of the assignment operator (=) in the if condition. The corrected line should look like this: 

`if ((cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))) != NULL)`. This will ensure that the condition will only evaluate to true if `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` returns a non-NULL value.

Additionally, error handling should be implemented to handle cases where `SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl))` returns NULL or a failure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
    foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))
                                 
                                 
                                 //do stuff
