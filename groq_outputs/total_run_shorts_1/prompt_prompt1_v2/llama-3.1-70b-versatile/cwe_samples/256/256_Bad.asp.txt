Hardcoded sensitive information

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains a hardcoded sensitive information. The provided code includes a connection string that has a username ("uid=db2admin") and password ("pwd=password") hardcoded. Hardcoding sensitive information is a major security risk as it can be accessed by unauthorized users if they gain access to the code or configurations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid hardcoding sensitive information, consider one of the following steps:

- Store sensitive information in secure environment variables or a secrets management service.
- Use a secure configuration file that is not accessible to unauthorized users.
- Encrypt and store sensitive information as part of the application's configuration.
- Use a library or framework that provides built-in support for securely storing and retrieving sensitive information.
