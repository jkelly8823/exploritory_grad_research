VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unsecured loading of configuration file and use of plain-text passwords.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet loads a configuration file named "config.properties" and retrieves a property named "password" from it. The password is then directly used to establish a database connection. This poses a significant security risk for several reasons: 

- The password is stored in plain text within the configuration file. An attacker who gains access to the file system can read the password and use it to access the database. 

- The loading of the configuration file and the retrieval of the password are not validated or sanitized. If an attacker were able to modify the configuration file or intercept its contents during transmission, they could potentially inject malicious data, including sensitive information or arbitrary code.

- The database connection is established directly using the retrieved password. This provides a direct pathway for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Store passwords securely: Use a secure secret management system or encrypt the password within the configuration file.
2. Use environment variables or secure property files: Store sensitive information such as database credentials as environment variables or within secure property files, rather than plain-text configuration files.
3. Validate and sanitize input: Validate the configuration file's contents and sanitize any retrieved data before using it to establish a database connection.
4. Use secure database connection methods: Use methods that do not pass the password as a plain text argument, such as password-based encryption or secure authentication mechanisms.

```java
...Properties prop = new Properties();prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));String password = prop.getProperty("password");DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);...
