VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded Credentials Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file. It contains two property values, `webapp.ldap.username` and `webapp.ldap.password`, which are set to hardcoded string values, `secretUsername` and `secretPassword`. These hardcoded string values are potentially sensitive information (e.g., login credentials) that should not be stored directly in source code.

Hardcoding sensitive information in code poses a significant security risk because it can be visible to unauthorized individuals through source code reviews, version control systems, or even leak onto the internet. Furthermore, if an attacker gains access to this information, they can use it to authenticate to the LDAP server and potentially cause harm.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the hardcoded credentials should be replaced with secure alternatives, such as environment variables, secure key-value stores (e.g., HashiCorp's Vault), or encrypted property files.

Here is an example of how the hardcoded credentials can be replaced with environment variables in a properties file:
```properties
webapp.ldap.username=${LDAP_USERNAME}
webapp.ldap.password=${LDAP_PASSWORD}
```
Alternatively, you can store these credentials securely in the operating system's environment variables and access them from the properties file or Java application code.
