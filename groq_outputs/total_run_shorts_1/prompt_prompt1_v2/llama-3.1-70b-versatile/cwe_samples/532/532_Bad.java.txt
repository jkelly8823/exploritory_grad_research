VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Log Injection Vulnerability
EXPLANATION: The given code snippet is vulnerable to a log injection attack. This type of vulnerability occurs when user-controlled input (in this case, the `usernme` and `ccn` variables) is directly logged without proper sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing crafted input that would be interpreted as a valid log entry, potentially leading to security issues such as revealing sensitive information or injecting false data.

Additionally, there seems to be a typo in the code (`usernme` should probably be `username`).

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Use parameterized logging instead of string concatenation.
- Validate and sanitize user-controlled input before logging.
- Use a secure logging mechanism that handles potential security threats.

ORIGINAL CODE:
logger.info("Username: " + usernme + ", CCN: " + ccn);
