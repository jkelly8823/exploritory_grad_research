VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a NullPointerException when attempting to call `locationClient.getLastLocation()` before ensuring that `locationClient` is successfully connected.

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, `locationClient.connect()` is called to establish a connection. However, `locationClient.getLastLocation()` is immediately called afterwards. The `connect` method does not block until the connection is established, which means that `locationClient.getLastLocation()` may be called before the connection is actually established. This can lead to a NullPointerException.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should wait for the `LocationClient` connection to be established before calling `locationClient.getLastLocation()`. You can achieve this by implementing the `onConnected` method in your `LocationClient.ConnectionCallbacks` and calling `locationClient.getLastLocation()` from within it.

Additionally, to handle the scenario where the connection is not successful, you should also implement the `onConnectionFailed` and `onConnectionSuspended` methods in your `LocationClient.ConnectionCallbacks`.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```java
locationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);
locationClient.connect();
currentUser.setLocation(locationClient.getLastLocation());

...

catch (Exception e) {
    AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
    builder.setMessage("Sorry, this application has experienced an error.");
    AlertDialog alert = builder.create();
    alert.show();
    Log.e("ExampleActivity", "Caught exception: " + e + " While on User:" + User.toString());
}
```
