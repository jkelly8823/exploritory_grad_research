VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a potential NullPointerException.

EXPLANATION:
Although the assert statement `assert email != null` is present, it does not prevent the code from throwing a NullPointerException in some situations. Assert statements can be disabled by the JVM, especially in production environments. Therefore, if `email` is indeed `null` and the assert statement is disabled, the code will continue to execute. If the `email` variable is used later in the code, this could lead to a NullPointerException.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it's recommended to explicitly check if `email` is not `null` and handle the scenario where it is `null`. This can be done using a simple null check and throwing a custom exception if `email` is `null`.

```java
String email = request.getParameter("email_address");
if (email == null) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Email address cannot be null");
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Objects.requireNonNull` method introduced in Java 7, which will throw a NullPointerException with a custom message:

```java
String email = Objects.requireNonNull(request.getParameter("email_address"), "Email address cannot be null");
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
String email = request.getParameter("email_address");assert email != null;
```
