VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a mistake due to a missing else clause and missing brackets around the if block. This could lead to incorrect program flow and unintended behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet consists of an if statement without brackets around the conditional block. In C-based languages, when the if statement block is not enclosed within brackets and it contains multiple statements, only the first statement is part of the if block. In this case, 'Do_X()' is part of the if block, and 'Do_Y()' will always be executed regardless of the condition. 

Moreover, the code does not use an else clause, which can sometimes lead to incorrect assumptions about code flow. However, given the provided code snippet, the presence of Do_Y() outside of the if statement suggests that it may actually be intended to always be executed; in this case the lack of an else clause isn't truly a vulnerability. Still, confusion about which statements should be associated with the conditional block is an issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the following should be done:

1. Include brackets around the statements that should be part of the if block. 
   - Assuming 'Do_Y()' should always be executed and 'Do_X()' should only execute if the condition is met, replace the code with:
   ```c
   if (condition){
      Do_X();
   }
   Do_Y();
   ```
   - Alternatively, if 'Do_Y()' should only be executed if the condition is true, use the following:
   ```c
   if (condition){
      Do_X();
      Do_Y();
   }
   ``` 
   - Alternatively, if some other condition should trigger 'Do_Y(', use the following pattern.
   ```c
   if (condition){
      Do_X();
   } else {
      Do_Y();
   }
   ```

   The exact method and correctness of your brackets and your conditional logic depend on intended code behavior.

2. Directly compare condition variables against true instead of using '==', when condition has been initialized to be of type boolean. Given we are just given a code snippet and lack supporting definitions, it's impossible to actually state if this recommendation applies.
   
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
   if (condition==true)Do_X();Do_Y();
```
