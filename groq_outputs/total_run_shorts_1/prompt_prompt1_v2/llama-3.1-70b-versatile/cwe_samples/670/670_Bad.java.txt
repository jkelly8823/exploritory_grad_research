 Missing Break Statements in Switch Case

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains a switch-case block for printing month names. However, each case in the switch case block is missing a break statement. This could lead to the execution of all the subsequent cases once the initial case is matched, resulting in the printing of all months from the initial matched month to December.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a break statement at the end of each case in the switch-case block to prevent unintended execution of subsequent cases. Here is an updated version of the code:

```java
public void printMessage(int month) {
    switch (month) {
    case 1: 
        print("January");
        break;
    case 2: 
        print("February");
        break;
    case 3: 
        print("March");
        break;
    case 4: 
        print("April");
        break;
    case 5: 
        print("May");
        break;
    case 6: 
        print("June");
        break;
    case 7: 
        print("July");
        break;
    case 8: 
        print("August");
        break;
    case 9: 
        print("September");
        break;
    case 10: 
        print("October");
        break;
    case 11: 
        print("November");
        break;
    case 12: 
        print("December");
        break;
    }
    println(" is a great month");
}
```

Alternatively, since all cases print a month and then append the same string, we could consider replacing the switch case block with an array of month names, which would simplify the code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public void printMessage(int month){
    switch (month) {
        
        case 1: print("January");case 2: print("February");case 3: print("March");case 4: print("April");case 5: print("May");case 6: print("June");case 7: print("July");case 8: print("August");case 9: print("September");case 10: print("October");case 11: print("November");case 12: print("December");
    }println(" is a great month");
}
```
