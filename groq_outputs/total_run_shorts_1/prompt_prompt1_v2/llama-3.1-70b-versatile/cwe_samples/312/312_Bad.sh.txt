VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Storage Account Credentials and Unencrypted Data at Rest

EXPLANATION:
The provided PowerShell code snippet is vulnerable to insecure storage account credentials and unencrypted data at rest. The code uses the `New-AzStorageEncryptionScope` cmdlet to create a new encryption scope for a storage account, but it does not employ secure practices for handling credentials. Furthermore, the `-StorageEncryption` parameter is mentioned but not specified, suggesting potential unencrypted data at rest. 

The key issue lies in hardcoding the resource group and storage account names directly into the script. Hardcoding sensitive information is a major security risk as it exposes credentials that could be accessed by unauthorized individuals. Also, if the storage encryption is not properly configured, it might lead to unencrypted data at rest.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To secure the code, consider the following recommendations:

1.  **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials**: Instead of hardcoding the resource group and storage account names, use environment variables or secure input methods to pass these values to the script.
2.  **Properly Configure Storage Encryption**: Ensure that the `-StorageEncryption` parameter is properly set up and enabled to encrypt data at rest.
3.  **Use Secure Input Methods**: Use secure input methods to pass sensitive information such as resource group names and storage account names to the script.

ORIGINAL CODE:
                  New-AzStorageEncryptionScope -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -AccountName "MyStorageAccount" -EncryptionScopeName testscope -StorageEncryption
