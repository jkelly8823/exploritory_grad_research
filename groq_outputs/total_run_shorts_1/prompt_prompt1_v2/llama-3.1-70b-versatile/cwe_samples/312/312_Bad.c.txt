VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to its usage of the `memcpy` function without checking the bounds of the destination buffer. Additionally, it is vulnerable to a string format error in the `error` function calls, which do not provide any parameters to the error message.

EXPLANATION:
The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from one location to another. In this case, it is being used to copy data from the `hp->h_addr` field to the `server.sin_addr` field. However, there is no bounds checking in the code to ensure that the destination buffer (`server.sin_addr`) is large enough to hold the data being copied. If `hp->h_length` is larger than the size of `server.sin_addr`, a buffer overflow will occur, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Furthermore, the `error` function calls do not provide any parameters to the error message, which can be vulnerable to string format errors. If an attacker can control the format string, they can potentially execute arbitrary code or crash the program.

The use of `atoi` is also a vulnerability as it does not handle potential errors and can allow an attacker to potentially cause the program to crash or execute arbitrary code if the input is not properly validated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, the following changes should be made:

- Use `strcpy` or `strncpy` instead of `memcpy` for copying string data to prevent buffer overflow attacks. However, as `server.sin_addr` is not a null-terminated string, this might not be feasible in this case. A safer approach would be to use `memcpy` with bounds checking.
- Use `strerror` or another safe error function instead of `error` to prevent string format errors.
- Use `strtoul` or another safe conversion function instead of `atoi` to prevent potential buffer overflows.
- Validate user input more thoroughly to prevent potential errors.
- Use header files from trusted sources like netinet/in.h, sys/types.h, arpa/inet.h for sockaddr_in structure and its members usage.
- Include checks to prevent undefined or negative port value after conversion.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
server.sin_family = AF_INET; 
hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]); 
if (hp==NULL) error("Unknown host"); 
memcpy( (char *)&server.sin_addr,(char *)hp->h_addr,hp->h_length); 
if (argc < 3) port = 80; 
else port = (unsigned short)atoi(argv[3]); 
server.sin_port = htons(port); 
if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof server) < 0) error("Connecting"); 
... 
while ((n=read(sock,buffer,BUFSIZE-1))!=-1) {
    write(dfd,password_buffer,n); 
...
