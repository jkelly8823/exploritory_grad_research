VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet appears to be from a Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file, containing sensitive information such as LDAP username and password.

EXPLANATION:
Hardcoding sensitive information, such as LDAP credentials, directly into a properties file poses a significant security risk. If an attacker gains access to this file, they can easily obtain the credentials and compromise the LDAP system. This vulnerability is categorized as a 'Sensitive Data Exposure' issue.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to store sensitive information securely, using a more robust approach such as environment variables or a secrets management solution. This way, even if the properties file is compromised, the sensitive data will remain protected. Additionally, consider using more secure authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT tokens, instead of hardcoded credentials.
