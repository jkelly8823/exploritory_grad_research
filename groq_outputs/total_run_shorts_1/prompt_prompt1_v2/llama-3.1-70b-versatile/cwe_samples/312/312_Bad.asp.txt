VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
 Hardcoded Sensitive Information

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet contains a hardcoded database connection string with a username ('uid=db2admin') and password ('pwd=password'). Hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code can lead to serious security issues. If an attacker gains access to the code, they can exploit this sensitive information to gain unauthorized access to the database.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
To fix this vulnerability, consider using environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store sensitive information. This way, the sensitive data is not directly hardcoded in the code and can be easily managed and rotated. Instead of hardcoding the username and password, use placeholders or environment variables that can be resolved at runtime.

For example, you could use a configuration file or an environment variable to store the connection string. In a .NET application, you can use a secure configuration file like the app.config or web.config files to store the connection string.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" />
  </connectionStrings>
