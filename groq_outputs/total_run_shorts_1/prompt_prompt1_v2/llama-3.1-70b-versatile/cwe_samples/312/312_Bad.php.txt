VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to insecure storage of sensitive information in cookies. Passwords should never be stored in plain text in cookies, as it compromises user security.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet functions to persist user login information by storing the username and password in a cookie named 'userdata'. However, storing passwords in plain text is insecure and poses a significant risk to user security. Cookies can be easily accessed through JavaScript or even obtained by an attacker through various techniques, exposing users' sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of storing the actual password in the cookie, consider using a secure method for persisting user sessions, such as storing a token or a user ID. This token should be generated by the server-side and be stored in a secure manner, preferably server-side. Never store passwords in plain text, and always use a secure method to authenticate and authorize users. Moreover, it is also recommended to hash and compare passwords in the backend to avoid security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```php
function persistLogin($username, $password){$data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);setcookie ("userdata", $data);}
```
