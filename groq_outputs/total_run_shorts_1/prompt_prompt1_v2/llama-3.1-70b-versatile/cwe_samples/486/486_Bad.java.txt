VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability that allows for potential class tampering or arbitrary class instantiation. The comparison using `inputClass.getClass().getName()` is based on a string value, which may be spoofed or tampered with. 

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises because the comparison relies solely on the name of the class, rather than verifying the type itself. In languages that support reflection or dynamic class loading, it's possible for a malicious actor to create a new class with the same name as the trusted class, thereby bypassing any security checks. This code snippet assumes that if the class name matches the trusted name, the class must be trustworthy.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of relying on the class name, you should use the `instanceof` operator or similar checks to verify the type of the class. This can be done by creating an `Enum` of trusted classes or maintaining a list of trusted classes, and then checking if the input class is an instance of one of these trusted classes. Additionally, you should consider whether the class should be compared directly or if it's more secure to verify the class hierarchy (e.g., checking if it's a subclass of a trusted class).

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
if (inputClass.getClass().getName().equals("TrustedClassName")) {
    
        // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
        
        // ...
        
}
```
