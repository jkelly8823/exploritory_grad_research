VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to a ClassCastException or other malicious behavior due to incorrect usage of the getClass() method for class comparison.

EXPLANATION:
The getClass() method in Java returns the runtime class of an object, not necessarily the compile-time type of the object. This can lead to issues when comparing classes using the '==' operator, as this only compares the instance of the Class object itself, not the class hierarchy. An attacker could potentially create a subclass of TrustedClass and pass it to this method, which could then bypass the intended security check.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using the instanceof operator instead of getClass() for class comparison. The instanceof operator checks if an object is an instance of a particular class or any of its subclasses, which is more secure in this context. Here is the recommended modification:

if (inputClass instanceof TrustedClass)

Additionally, consider using a more secure approach to access control, such as using authentication and authorization frameworks, and implementing defenses against common web attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
if (inputClass.getClass() == TrustedClass.class) {
    // Do something assuming you trust inputClass
    // ...
}
