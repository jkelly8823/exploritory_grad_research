VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Class Equality Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The `equals` method is comparing the class of the input `obj` to the class of the current object using `getClass() == getClass()`. This comparison is performed using `==` operator which checks for reference equality, not instance equality. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially cause the `equals` method to return incorrect results if the classes are the same but loaded from different classloaders.

In addition, this comparison is too broad and may not handle subclassing correctly. Subclasses of the current class will have a different class, so this comparison will return `false` for subclass instances.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of using `getClass() == getClass()`, consider using `instanceof` operator or `getClass().isAssignableFrom(obj.getClass())` to check if the input object is an instance of the current class or one of its subclasses. Also, consider overriding `hashCode` method if you override `equals` method.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    ...
       
    // first check to see if the object is of the same class
    if (obj.getClass() == this.getClass()) {...}
    ...
}
```
