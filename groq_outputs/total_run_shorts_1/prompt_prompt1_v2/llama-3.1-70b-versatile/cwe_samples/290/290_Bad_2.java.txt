VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Host Header Injection and Canonical Hostname Verification Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code has multiple vulnerabilities, but the primary one lies in using the canonical hostname of an IP address to validate trust. 
InetAddress.getByName(ip) can return an IP address that is different from the original ip if the IP address is an IPv6 address. 
This means the Canonical hostname resolution may return a different hostname or IP than expected. Additionally, InetAddress.getByName(ip) may also suffer from host header injection vulnerabilities in reverse proxy setups. 
Furthermore, if the reverse DNS lookup for the IP address does not return the expected "trustme.com" hostname but rather returns an empty hostname, then the endsWith check would throw a null pointer exception, further verifying that this code can result in unpredictable behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, the code should not rely solely on the canonical hostname of an IP address for validation. One way to do this is to check the client IP against a list of trusted IP addresses. If reverse DNS is required, the lookup should validate the IP and hostname both. Use a host header validation system that directly checks the request headers to avoid host header injection. Keep in mind it's most secure to create a robust input validation system for incoming requests to prevent any confusion with these DNS and request header variables. Validate inputs and only accept strings that come from a trusted and whitelisted set.

ORIGINAL CODE:

String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
   trusted = true;
}
