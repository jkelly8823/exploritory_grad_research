VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Dangling Pointer Vulnerability (Potential Use-After-Free)

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability is introduced in line 7. The code is storing the address of `bufs[i]` in the `pending_cleartext_input_` container. However, there is no guarantee that the `bufs` array will not go out of scope or be reallocated after this insertion, potentially causing a dangling pointer. If the `bufs` array is freed or its memory is reused, accessing the stored pointers in `pending_cleartext_input_` could lead to undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, instead of storing pointers to `bufs[i]`, you could store copies of the buffers or use a smart pointer that manages the memory. Alternatively, you could ensure that the `bufs` array remains valid for as long as the pointers are stored in `pending_cleartext_input_`.

Here's a possible fix that involves storing copies of the buffers:

```cpp
pending_cleartext_input_.insert(pending_cleartext_input_.end(),
                                bufs[i],
                                bufs[count]);
```

Note: This fix assumes that `pending_cleartext_input_` is a container of the same type as `bufs`.

If you cannot store copies of the buffers, you can use a smart pointer like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to manage the memory:

```cpp
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<char[]>> pending_cleartext_input_;
...
pending_cleartext_input_.emplace_back(new char[bufs[i]]);
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
if (i != count) {
    int err;
    Local<Value> arg = GetSSLError(written, &err, &error_);
    if (!arg.IsEmpty()) {
      current_write_ = nullptr;
      return UV_EPROTO;
    }

    pending_cleartext_input_.insert(pending_cleartext_input_.end(),
                                    &bufs[i],
                                    &bufs[count]);
```
