VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure through Unhandled Error Messages

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be checking for Linux capabilities using the `capget` syscall. However, it does not properly handle potential error messages returned by this syscall. This can lead to potential information disclosure or undefined behavior if the syscall fails and an error code is returned.

In line 7, the `syscall(SYS_capget, &cap_header_data, &cap_data)` call may return an error code, but this code is not being properly checked or handled. It simply checks if the syscall returned an non-zero value, which could also represent a valid capability value.

Additionally, in case of an error, the `sys/capability.h` include and `capget` function require specific error checking to be handled safely. It is necessary to check the exact error code returned by `capget` and handle potential exceptions that may be raised during its execution. Without this, the program may reveal sensitive information about the error condition, potentially allowing attacks to infer details about the capability state or available resources.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we should handle the potential error codes returned by the `capget` syscall. We can use `strerror` or `perror` to get the specific error message, allowing us to respond securely to failures.

```cpp
static bool HasOnly(int capability) {
  DCHECK(cap_valid(capability));

  struct __user_cap_data_struct cap_data[2];
  struct __user_cap_header_struct cap_header_data = {
    _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3,
    getpid()};

  int capret = syscall(SYS_capget, &cap_header_data, &cap_data);
  if (capret != 0) {
    // Safe handling of error messages, e.g. by returning instead of printing
    return false;
    // Alternative for local process with logging available, use as example:
    // perror("capget failed");
    // return false;
  }
  if (capability < 32) {
    return cap_data[0].permitted ==
        static_cast<unsigned int>(CAP_TO_MASK(capability));
  }
  return cap_data[1].permitted ==
      static_cast<unsigned int>(CAP_TO_MASK(capability));
}

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
static bool HasOnly(int capability) {
  DCHECK(cap_valid(capability));

  struct __user_cap_data_struct cap_data[2];
  struct __user_cap_header_struct cap_header_data = {
    _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3,
    getpid()};

  if (syscall(SYS_capget, &cap_header_data, &cap_data) != 0) {
    return false;
  }
  if (capability < 32) {
    return cap_data[0].permitted ==
        static_cast<unsigned int>(CAP_TO_MASK(capability));
  }
  return cap_data[1].permitted ==
      static_cast<unsigned int>(CAP_TO_MASK(capability));
}
