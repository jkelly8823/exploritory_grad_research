VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure through System Call Error Codes

EXPLANATION:
The function HasOnly returns false immediately when the syscall capget fails, without checking the error code. This could lead to information disclosure as a failed syscall can reveal the state of the system's capabilities. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain insight into the system's capabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of directly returning false when capget fails, consider checking the error code with errno or perror to gather more information about the failure. This can help prevent potential information disclosure and allow for more robust error handling. Additionally, consider logging or reporting the error in a way that does not reveal sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static bool HasOnly(int capability) {
  DCHECK(cap_valid(capability));

  struct __user_cap_data_struct cap_data[_LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_3];
  struct __user_cap_header_struct cap_header_data = {
    _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3,
    getpid()};

  if (syscall(SYS_capget, &cap_header_data, &cap_data) != 0) {
    return false;
  }

  static_assert(arraysize(cap_data) == 2);
  return cap_data[CAP_TO_INDEX(capability)].permitted ==
             static_cast<unsigned int>(CAP_TO_MASK(capability)) &&
         cap_data[1 - CAP_TO_INDEX(capability)].permitted == 0;
}
#endif

// Look up the environment variable and allow the lookup if the current
```
Note: The line numbers refer to the line where the potential vulnerability occurs, which in this case is the `if` statement on line 9. However, since the issue affects the entire method's error handling, the entire function should be reviewed and modified as necessary to handle errors more securely.
