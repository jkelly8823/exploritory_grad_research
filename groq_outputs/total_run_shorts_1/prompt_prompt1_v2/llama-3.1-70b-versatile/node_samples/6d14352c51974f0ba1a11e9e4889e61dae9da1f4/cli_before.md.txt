VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a documentation passage explaining the behavior of the `io_uring` environment variable in Node.js and its security concerns. No actual code is presented, and therefore, no vulnerability can be detected.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:

`io_uring` is disabled by default due to security concerns. When `io_uring`
is enabled, applications must not change the user identity of the process at
runtime, neither through JavaScript functions such as [`process.setuid()`][] nor
through native addons that can invoke system functions such as [`setuid(2)`][].

This environment variable is implemented by a dependency of Node.js and may be
removed in future versions of Node.js. No stability guarantees are provided for
the behavior of this environment variable.
