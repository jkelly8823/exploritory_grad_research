VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code is vulnerable to a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack due to improper verification of certificate subject alternative names (SANs).

EXPLANATION:
The code appears to be verifying that a certificate contains a DNS name, but it does not properly check the subject alternative names. In the provided certificate examples, some of them contain wildcard DNS names or IP addresses, but the code does not handle these cases correctly.

Specifically, the code checks if a certificate contains a DNS name by looking at the `subjectaltname` and `subject` properties. However, it does not correctly parse the `subjectaltname` property, which can contain multiple values separated by commas.

The code also does not handle the case where a certificate contains a wildcard DNS name, which can match multiple subdomains. This can lead to a situation where a certificate is considered valid for a domain, even if it does not actually match the domain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should be modified to correctly parse the `subjectaltname` property and handle the case where a certificate contains a wildcard DNS name.

Here are some recommended fixes:

* Use a library to parse the certificate and extract the subject alternative names.
* Check if the subject alternative names contain a DNS name that matches the host.
* Handle the case where a certificate contains a wildcard DNS name by checking if the DNS name is a wildcard and if the host matches the wildcard.

ORIGINAL CODE:

  {
    host: 'a.com',
    cert: { },
    error: 'Cert does not contain a DNS name'
  },

  // Empty Subject w/DNS name
  {
  {
    host: 'a.b.a.com', cert: {
      subjectaltname: 'URI:http://a.b.a.com/',
    },
    error: 'Cert does not contain a DNS name'
  },

  // Multiple CN fields
  {
    host: 'a.b.a.com', cert: {
      subjectaltname: 'URI:http://a.b.a.com/',
      subject: {}
    },
    error: 'Cert does not contain a DNS name'
  },
  {
    host: 'a.b.a.com', cert: {
      subjectaltname: 'URI:http://*.b.a.com/',
      subject: {}
    },
    error: 'Cert does not contain a DNS name'
  },
  // IP addresses
  {
    host: 'a.b.a.com', cert: {
      subjectaltname: 'IP Address:127.0.0.1',
      subject: {}
    },
    error: 'Cert does not contain a DNS name'
  },
  {
    host: '127.0.0.1', cert: {
      subjectaltname: 'IP Address:127.0.0.1',
