VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential buffer overflow and memory safety issues due to unchecked usage of snprintf and cryptographically insecure hash functions.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a Node.js addon that provides a cryptographic hashing function. However, there are some potential security issues.

- The code uses `EVP_get_digestbyname` to get a pointer to an `EVP_MD` structure based on a user-provided string. If the string is not recognized, the function returns a null pointer. However, if the string is recognized but its associated hash function is not initialized (for example, because the `EVP_add_digest_alias` function was called without the `EVP_get_digestbyname` function being called beforehand), the returned pointer will not be null but will point to an uninitialized `EVP_MD` structure, which could lead to undefined behavior.

- The code uses `EVP_Digest` function which does not handle memory management. It leaves the responsibility of memory management to the developer. In this case, the developer does not seem to handle the memory properly.

- It is worth noting that using cryptographic hash functions such as `EVP_get_digestbyname` and `EVP_Digest` might not be the best choice due to their inefficiencies and not supporting many cryptographic hash functions, especially the newer ones.

- At lines 42-45 and 50-52, there's another potential security issue: if an attacker provides a very large input, this could potentially cause a heap buffer overflow or a similar memory corruption vulnerability.

- Finally, the developers might use base64 to receive data, but using CRYPTO_memcmp is cryptographically insecure (although this doesn't appear to apply in this case since they throw an exception if they do not match exactly).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities:

- Always check the return values of `EVP_get_digestbyname` and `EVP_Digest` to ensure the function call was successful.
- Make sure to correctly handle memory during hash computations to prevent heap corruption.
- Consider using `EVP_get_digestbyname` in a safe way, together with other EVP functions that avoid any problems.

In addition to this, you should:

- Avoid using `CRYPTO_memcmp` for any kind of comparison of sensitive information.
- Use safer functions such as `CRYPTO_memcmp` or similar with hash function digest comparison, consider `EVP_hash` that also supports newer hash functions.

- Use non-null pointer checks to ensure that returned values aren't null before their dereference.

- Consider adding the "error_code" if you must for any critical error that the usage of "throw" is uncaught.

- When a function has multiple potential paths to report a memory error, some may be silent. Care should be taken to report all such events as not getting this one can also greatly alter final outputs.
