VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Double check that potentially sensitive data is cleaned up after throwing or returning.
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability occurs because the code is attempting to dispose of `req_wrap` when an error occurs, but the `DoTryWrite` function is called after the potential error has been checked for and potentially after `req_wrap` has been disposed of. This means that any subsequent operations involving `req_wrap` may be accessing freed memory.

Additionally, the error handling is complex and involves checking for multiple potential error conditions, but the flow of control is not carefully controlled for in each branch.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that `req_wrap` is not accessed after it has potentially been disposed of. This involves carefully managing the flow of control through each branch of the error handling logic.

It could also be beneficial to simplify the error handling in this code, potentially by returning an error code that prevents access to `req_wrap` if an error occurs, rather than allowing access and manually checking for potential NULL dereferences.

In the `if (err != 0 && req_wrap != nullptr)` block, add a `return` after `req_wrap->Dispose();` or throw an exception or set an error flag to indicate that an error has occurred.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    StreamReq::ResetObject(req_wrap_obj);
  }

  AsyncHooks::DefaultTriggerAsyncIdScope trigger_scope(GetAsyncWrap());
  ShutdownWrap* req-wrap = CreateShutdownWrap(req_wrap_obj);
  int err = DoShutdown(req_wrap);

  if (err != 0 && req_wrap != nullptr) {
    req_wrap->Dispose();
  if (send_handle == nullptr) {
    err = DoTryWrite(&bufs, &count);
    if (err != 0 || count == 0) {
      return StreamWriteResult { false, err, nullptr, total_bytes };
    }
  }

  v8::HandleScope handle_scope(env->isolate());
    if (!env->write_wrap_template()
             ->NewInstance(env->context())
             .ToLocal(&req_wrap_obj)) {
      return StreamWriteResult { false, UV_EBUSY, nullptr, 0 };
    }
    StreamReq::ResetObject(req_wrap_obj);
  }

  AsyncHooks::DefaultTriggerAsyncIdScope trigger_scope(GetAsyncWrap());
  WriteWrap* req_wrap = CreateWriteWrap(req_wrap_obj);

  err = DoWrite(req_wrap, bufs, count, send_handle);
  bool async = err == 0;

    ClearError();
  }

  return StreamWriteResult { async, err, req_wrap, total_bytes };
}
