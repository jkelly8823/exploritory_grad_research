VULNERABLE: NO

VULNERABLE_LINES: None

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be handling error checking after a write operation. It checks for immediate failure or success, and if either condition is met, it sets a write result and returns the error. There are no obvious signs of vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The variables and functions used seem to be properly checked and validated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
// Immediate failure or success
if (err != 0 || count == 0) {
  SetWriteResult(StreamWriteResult { false, err, nullptr, data_size, {} });
  return err;
}

// Partial write
```
