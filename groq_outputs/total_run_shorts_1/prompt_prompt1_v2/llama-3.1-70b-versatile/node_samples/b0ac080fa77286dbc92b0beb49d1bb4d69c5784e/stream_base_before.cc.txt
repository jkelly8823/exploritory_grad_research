VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities. The `if` statement checks for errors or a count of zero, and if either condition is met, it sets a write result and returns the error. This appears to be a defensive check to prevent potential issues later in the code. There is no clear indication of a vulnerability, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or command injection. The code snippet does not contain any user-provided input or data being directly inserted into a command or a database query.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be provided as the code snippet does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
// Immediate failure or success
if (err != 0 || count == 0) {
  SetWriteResult(StreamWriteResult { false, err, nullptr, data_size });
  return err;
}

// Partial write
```
