VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code snippet is not vulnerable to any known security issues.

EXPLANATION: 
The code provided appears to be a subset of a larger C++ program that handles permission string conversions and scope checks. It does not contain any user input or external data sources, making it unlikely to be vulnerable to security threats. However, without the definitions and declarations, this assessment may not be comprehensive.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
return is_scope_granted(permission, res);
}

static PermissionScope StringToPermission(const std::string& perm);
static const char* PermissionToString(PermissionScope perm);
static void ThrowAccessDenied(Environment* env,
                                PermissionScope perm,
```
