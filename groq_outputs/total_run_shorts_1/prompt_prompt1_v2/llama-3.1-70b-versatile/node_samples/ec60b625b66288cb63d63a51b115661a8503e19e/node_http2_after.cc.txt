VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure hardcoding of NGHTTP2 option.

EXPLANATION:
The code sets the maximum outbound ack with a hardcoded value of 10000 when the IsReverted(SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9512) check returns true. This indicates that the code is attempting to mitigate a known security issue, CVE-2019-9512, but it does not clearly follow secure coding practices. Hardcoding the mitigation value may not be suitable for all scenarios, and it does not allow for flexibility or future adjustments.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To improve the security of this code, consider the following recommendations:

- Make the value used in nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack() configurable.
- Consider using a securely generated value or a value based on the specific requirements of the application.
- Use a more flexible and adaptable approach to mitigating CVE-2019-9512.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
buffer[IDX_OPTIONS_PEER_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS]);
  }

  if (IsReverted(SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9512))
    nghttp2_option_set_max_outbound_ack(options_, 10000);

  // The padding strategy sets the mechanism by which we determine how much
  // additional frame padding to apply to DATA and HEADERS frames. Currently
  // this is set on a per-session basis, but eventually we may switch to
  // a per-stream setting, giving users greater control
