VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the provided code snippet, we did not identify any potential vulnerabilities.

The code appears to be implementing a require function that either uses the original prototype.require function or resolves a request based on certain conditions. Without more context or information, we cannot identify any clear vulnerabilities. The require function does not seem to be directly vulnerable to common attacks like path traversal or prototype pollution.

It is essential to note that without more code and context, we cannot completely rule out any potential vulnerabilities. However, based on the snippet provided, there are no apparent security concerns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were identified, there are no recommended fixes at this time.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
};
} else {
  require = function require(path) {
    // When no policy manifest, the original prototype.require is sustained
    return mod.require(path);
  };
}

function resolve(request, options) {
```
