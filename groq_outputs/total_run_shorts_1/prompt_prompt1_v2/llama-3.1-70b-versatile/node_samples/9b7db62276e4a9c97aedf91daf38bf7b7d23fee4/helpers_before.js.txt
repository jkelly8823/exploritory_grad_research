VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dynamic Function Resolution with Unvalidated Input

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet defines a custom `require` function which calls another function referenced by the symbolic property `require_private_symbol` on the `mod` object. This function takes the `mod` object and the `path` as parameters. However, this function is called with a dynamically generated `path` parameter, which comes from an untrusted source `request`. In certain scenarios, this could be exploited to access modules that should not be accessible.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The vulnerability can be fixed by validating and sanitizing the input to the `require` function. It's essential to ensure that only authorized paths and modules are accessible. A possible fix would be to implement whitelisting of allowed paths and modules and restrict the dynamic resolution to only those that are allowed. Additionally, consider using more secure alternatives such as `esm.import()` or `require.resolve()`.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
  };
} else {
  require = function require(path) {
    return mod[require_private_symbol](mod, path);
  };
}

function resolve(request, options) {
```
