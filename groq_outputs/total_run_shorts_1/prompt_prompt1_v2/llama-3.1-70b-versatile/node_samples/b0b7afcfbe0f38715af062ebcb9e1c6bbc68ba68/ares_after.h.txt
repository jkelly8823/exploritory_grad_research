VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a library that provides asynchronous DNS resolution using name servers. The code defines function prototypes for library initialization and cleanup. It also includes conditional compilation directives for different platforms. After careful analysis, I did not find any potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use of insecure functions, or incorrect handling of memory allocations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are necessary for this code snippet. However, it is essential to review the entire codebase to ensure that the implementation of these functions is secure and follows best practices.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#  include <netinet/in.h>
#endif

#if defined(ANDROID) || defined(__ANDROID__)
#include <jni.h>
#endif

#ifdef  __cplusplus
