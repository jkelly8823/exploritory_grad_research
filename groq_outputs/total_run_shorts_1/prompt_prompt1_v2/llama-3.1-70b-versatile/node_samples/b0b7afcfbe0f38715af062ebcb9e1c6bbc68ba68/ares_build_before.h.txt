VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code defines the data type 'ares_ssize_t' based on the system architecture. It checks for the Windows 32-bit and 64-bit architectures and defines the type accordingly. For other systems, it either uses the type defined in 'CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T' or defaults to the standard 'ssize_t' type. This code is a common way to define data types that are system-architecture-agnostic and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as it appears to be safe and secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
/* Data type definition of ares_ssize_t. */
#ifdef _WIN32
#  ifdef _WIN64
     typedef __int64 ares_ssize_t;
#  else
     typedef long ares_ssize_t;
#  endif
#else
#  ifdef CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T
     typedef CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T ares_ssize_t;
#  else
     typedef ssize_t ares_ssize_t;
#  endif
#endif

#endif /* __CARES_BUILD_H */
