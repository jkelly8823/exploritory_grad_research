VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: N/A
EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet appears to be a comment block explaining the behavior of an error handling function in a Windows-specific context. There is no executable code provided in the snippet, and therefore, no vulnerability can be identified.
RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A
ORIGINAL CODE:
 *     On Windows we store the error in the thread errno, not
 *     in the winsock error code. This is to avoid loosing the
 *     actual last winsock error. So use macro ERRNO to fetch the
 *     errno this function sets when returning NULL, not SOCKERRNO.
 * author:
 *     Paul Vixie, 1996.
