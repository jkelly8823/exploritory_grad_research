VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines a data type `ares_ssize_t` based on the platform architecture using preprocessor directives. It checks the operating system and architecture, then defines `CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T` accordingly. This definition is then used to create a `typedef` statement for `ares_ssize_t`. This code is well-structured and platform-aware. No potential security vulnerabilities or bugs were identified in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None needed, as this code appears to be well-designed and secure.

ORIGINAL CODE:
/* Data type definition of ares_ssize_t. */
#ifdef _WIN32
#  ifdef _WIN64
#    define CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T __int64
#  else
#    define CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T long
#  endif
#else
#  define CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T ssize_t
#endif

typedef CARES_TYPEOF_ARES_SSIZE_T ares_ssize_t;

#endif /* __CARES_BUILD_H */
