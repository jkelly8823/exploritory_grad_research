VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of deprecated function GetVersionExW and potential buffer overflow vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the GetVersionExW function, which has been deprecated in Windows 10 (Threshold) and later. Its use is discouraged due to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. When the buffer OsvEx is too small for the provided dwOSVersionInfoSize, it can result in a buffer overflow. In this case, the code attempts to handle this by resizing the buffer and attempting to call the function again. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of a buffer overflow, especially if the platform version is not win32s and GetVersionExW does not return the expected structure size.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, we recommend using the more secure and modern function, RtlGetVersion, along with the RTL_OSVERSIONINFOEX structure. This is supported starting from Windows 8.1, so make sure to check for compatibility.

Here is an example of how to use RtlGetVersion:
```c
RTL_OSVERSIONINFOEX OsvEx;
ULONGLONG dwConditionMask = 0;
NTSTATUS status = RtlGetVersion((PRTL_OSVERSIONINFOEX)&OsvEx);
```
Alternatively, for platforms that don't support RtlGetVersion, it's recommended to use the VerifyVersionInfo function, as shown in Microsoft's documentation for GetVersionEx:
```c
OSVERSIONINFOW osvi;
ZeroMemory(&osvi, sizeof(OSVERSIONINFOW));
osvi.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(OSVERSIONINFOW);
if (!VerifyVersionInfo(&osvi, VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_WINNT, VER_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, &(OSVERSIONINFOW){.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(OSVERSIONINFOW), .dwPlatformId = VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT}))
{
    // handle failure
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
memset(&OsvEx, 0, sizeof(OsvEx));
OsvEx.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(OSVERSIONINFOEX);
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#pragma warning(push)
#pragma warning(disable:4996) /* warning C4996: 'GetVersionExW': was declared deprecated */
#endif
if (!GetVersionEx((void *)&OsvEx))
{
    memset(&OsvEx, 0, sizeof(OsvEx));
    OsvEx.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(OSVERSIONINFO);
    if (!GetVersionEx((void *)&OsvEx))
        return WIN_UNKNOWN;
}
#ifdef _MSC_VER
#pragma warning(pop)
#endif

switch(OsvEx.dwPlatformId)
{
    case V_PLATFORM_WIN32s:
