VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The given segment of code refers to a security vulnerability (CVE-2021-44531) and disabling support for uniformResourceIdentifier subject alternative names to mitigate this vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
Although there is no direct vulnerability in this code snippet, it mentions a CVE and a corresponding mitigative measure. This implies that the original codebase was vulnerable to CVE-2021-44531 and the fix was implemented by disabling support for uniformResourceIdentifier subject alternative names. This fix likely prevents attackers from manipulating Uniform Resource Identifiers and executing arbitrary code, but the actual code changes are not shown in the provided snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that Uniform Resource Identifiers are properly sanitized and validated.
- Use standardized and secure methods for handling Uniform Resource Identifiers.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
- Update to the latest Node.js version if not already using one of the versions mentioned (v14.18.3 or v12.22.9 or later).
