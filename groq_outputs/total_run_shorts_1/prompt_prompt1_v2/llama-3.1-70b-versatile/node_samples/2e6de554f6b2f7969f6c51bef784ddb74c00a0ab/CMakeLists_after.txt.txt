VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a CMake file that sets up a project and specifies some build settings. It does not contain any executable code and only deals with build configurations. As such, it does not present a security vulnerability in and of itself.

The CMake version requirement is set to 3.5.1, and the CMP0069 policy is set to NEW, which indicates that the code uses a relatively modern and actively maintained version of CMake.

The C standard is set to 99, which might be considered somewhat outdated, as the current standard is C11 or later. However, this in itself is not a vulnerability.

In general, this code snippet appears to be properly configured and secure for its intended purpose.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To further improve security and ensure the latest features, consider using a more recent C standard, such as C11 or C17, by updating the CMAKE_C_STANDARD line.

ORIGINAL CODE:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)
