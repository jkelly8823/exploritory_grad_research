No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
This code segment consists of preprocessor directives that define constants for HTTP version numbers and a mode setting. These directives do not perform any dynamic operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code defines constants in a secure way and does not include any user input that could be used in an attack.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes are required to improve the security of this code.
