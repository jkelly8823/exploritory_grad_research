VULNERABLE_LINES: 12-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential out-of-bounds array access due to unchecked index value
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains an array 'maxAndExpected' with a predefined size of 3 elements. However, the index 'requests' is used to access this array without any bounds checking. If 'requests' is a variable with a value outside the range of 0-2, this could lead to an out-of-bounds array access, potentially resulting in an error or unintended behavior. Unfortunately, the code snippet does not include the definition or initialization of the 'requests' variable, which makes it difficult to determine whether this vulnerability will actually occur. However, it's a potential issue that should be addressed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, add bounds checking to ensure that 'requests' is within the range of valid indices for the 'maxAndExpected' array. This can be done using a simple if statement to check if 'requests' is within the array bounds before attempting to access the array.

```javascript
let max;
let expected;
if (requests >= 0 && requests < maxAndExpected.length) {
  max = maxAndExpected[requests][0];
  expected = maxAndExpected[requests][1];
} else {
  // Handle invalid 'requests' value
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
let responses = 0;

const headers = {};
const N = 100;
for (let i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
  headers[`key${i}`] = i;
}

const maxAndExpected = [ // for server
  [50, 50],
  [1500, 102],
  [0, N + 2] // Host and Connection
];
let max = maxAndExpected[requests][0];
let expected = maxAndExpected[requests][1];
server.listen(0, function() {
  const maxAndExpected = [ // for client
    [20, 20],
    [1200, 103],
    [0, N + 3] // Connection, Date and Transfer-Encoding
  ];
  doRequest();
```
