VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to unchecked error handling.
 
EXPLANATION:
The code checks if a new HTTP/2 stream can be added, and if not, sends a protocol-level response to reject the stream. However, the potential for unhandled edge cases in the `CanAddStream()` check and `Http2Stream::New` function calls might lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability if an attacker can cause the error condition by intentionally opening too many streams.

The call to `nghttp2_submit_rst_stream` typically closes the stream when an error occurs. However, if this error is intentionally or maliciously triggered, the function call can be repeatedly invoked, resulting in a high CPU load. This could potentially lead to Denial of Service.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement comprehensive error checking and handling for `CanAddStream()` and `Http2Stream::New`. In the event of repeated failures, adding rate limiting to prevent such attacks, or alternative measures to prevent this kind of abuse, would be advisable.

Additionally, validation and sanitization of input data can help mitigate Denial of Service attacks by reducing the possibility of maliciously triggering an error condition.

The response value of the `nghttp2_submit_rst_stream` function should also be checked to make sure that the request to reset the stream was actually successfully submitted.

      // Too many concurrent streams being opened
      nghttp2_submit_rst_stream(**session, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, id,
                                NGHTTP2_ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM);
      return NGHTTP2_ERR_TEMPORAL_CALLBACK_FAILURE;
    }
  } else if (!stream->IsDestroyed()) {
    stream->StartHeaders(frame->headers.cat);
  }
  return 0;
