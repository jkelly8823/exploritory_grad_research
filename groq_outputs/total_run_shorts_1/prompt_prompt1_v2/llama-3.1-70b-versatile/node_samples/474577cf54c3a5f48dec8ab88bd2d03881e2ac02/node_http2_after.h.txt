VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No detected vulnerabilities

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a class or struct that handles HTTP/2 stream management. It includes various member variables and function declarations for handling outgoing data and stream management. 

No potential vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, race conditions, or insecure use of containers, are apparent in this snippet. The function declarations seem to follow normal function signature conventions, and there are no explicitly insecure operations or practices.

However, without the implementation of the functions `CopyDataIntoOutgoing` and `ClearOutgoing`, it is impossible to assess the security of those functions.

Since there is not enough information in the provided code snippet to identify a specific vulnerability, we must conclude that no vulnerability is present.

RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
  std::vector<nghttp2_stream_write> outgoing_buffers_;
  std::vector<uint8_t> outgoing_storage_;
  std::vector<int32_t> pending_rst_streams_;
  // Count streams that have been rejected while being opened. Exceeding a fixed
  // limit will result in the session being destroyed, as an indication of a
  // misbehaving peer. This counter is reset once new streams are being
  // accepted again.
  int32_t rejected_stream_count_ = 0;

  void CopyDataIntoOutgoing(const uint8_t* src, size_t src_length);
  void ClearOutgoing(int status);
