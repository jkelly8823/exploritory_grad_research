VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure through HTTP/2 Stream Rejection

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that an attacker can potentially cause the server to reveal information about the maximum number of concurrent streams that can be opened, which is a critical aspect of the server's configuration and capacity. By opening and closing a large number of streams in a short time period, an attacker can induce the server to reject streams and return an error code of NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE. This may not be itself an attack, but it's unusual.  

However the more pressing concern is the fact that an attacker can identify, that a Revert is active (or not active) and that a NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE might indicate success in overflowing streams.  

An attacker may be able to use this information to their advantage in crafting attacks against the server or in exploiting other vulnerabilities that rely on specific server configurations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1.  Instead of returning a specific error code of NGHTTP2_ERR_CALLBACK_FAILURE, consider returning a more generic error code that does not reveal any information about the server's configuration or capacity.
2.  Implement rate limiting and/or IP blocking to prevent attackers from flooding the server with requests meant to overflow streams.
3.  Review and validate user input and ensure that it's not used in a way that may cause the server to return sensitive information.
