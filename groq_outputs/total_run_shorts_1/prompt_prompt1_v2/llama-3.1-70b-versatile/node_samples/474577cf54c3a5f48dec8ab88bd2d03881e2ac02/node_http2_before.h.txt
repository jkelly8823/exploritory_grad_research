VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided does not contain any vulnerabilities within itself. The code appears to be part of a class or struct in C++ that deals with HTTP/2 framing. The functions `CopyDataIntoOutgoing` and `ClearOutgoing` are declared without their implementations, which may be the source of potential vulnerabilities elsewhere in the codebase. However, given the snippet provided, no issues were found.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
std::vector<nghttp2_stream_write> outgoing_buffers_;
std::vector<uint8_t> outgoing_storage_;
std::vector<int32_t> pending_rst_streams_;

void CopyDataIntoOutgoing(const uint8_t* src, size_t src_length);
void ClearOutgoing(int status);
```
