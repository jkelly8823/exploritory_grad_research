VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential vulnerability exists due to the use of a wildcard character (*) in file system path globbing.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provides an example of using the `--allow-fs-read` option to allow read access to files matching a wildcard pattern. However, the use of a wildcard character (`*`) can be potentially abused to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files. Specifically, if the `--allow-fs-read` option is not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker might be able to manipulate the glob pattern to access sensitive files or directories. For instance, an attacker could potentially read sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, or other system configuration files. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider adding additional validation and sanitization for the glob pattern used with the `--allow-fs-read` option. Here are a few steps that can be taken:

1.  Use a more specific glob pattern, ideally one without the wildcard character (`*`), if possible.
2.  Validate user inputs: make sure the file permissions do not contain wildcard patterns (`*`, `?`, `**/`, `./`, etc).
3.  Use an absolute file path where possible.
4.  Validate every read operation to ensure it's allowed and reject or deny access if the path tries to access files outside of the intended scope.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```bash
--allow-fs-read=/home/test*` will allow read access to everything
that matches the wildcard. e.g: `/home/test/file1` or `/home/test2`

After passing a wildcard character (`*`) all subsequent characters will
be ignored. For example: `/home/*.js` will work similar to `/home/*`.
