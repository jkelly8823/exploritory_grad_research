VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code uses glob-like patterns in the `--allow-fs-read` flags to grant permission for file system reads. However, the pattern `/a/b/*` is too permissive, allowing an attacker to potentially read files outside of the intended directory. This is a path traversal vulnerability, which could be exploited by an attacker to access sensitive files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, you should use more specific patterns that do not allow access to files outside of the intended directory. In this case, you can change the pattern `/a/b/*` to `/a/b/**/*.` or `/a/b/*.txt` depending on your needs. However, this is not foolproof and other checks should be performed.

It's better to avoid allowing access to arbitrary files using glob patterns. You can instead allow access to specific files or directories, and validate the paths before performing any file operations. Also, be aware of the potential risks when using file system permissions with glob patterns.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
'--experimental-permission',
'--allow-fs-read=/a/b/*',
'--allow-fs-read=/a/b/d',
'-e',
`
const assert = require('assert')
assert.ok(process.permission.has('fs.read', '/a/b/c'));
assert.ok(!process.permission.has('fs.read', '/a/c/c'));
`,
]
);
assert.strictEqual(status, 0, stderr.toString());
```
