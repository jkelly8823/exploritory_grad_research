VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No discernible vulnerability was detected in the code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet declares a struct with a constant member variable `settings` and a constant `kMaxHeaderSize` within a conditional compilation directive. It then defines this constant member variable with a value that is unspecified in the given code snippet. There are no apparent control flow logic, data processing, or function calls that would indicate a potential vulnerability. The code presented appears to be a straightforward declaration and initialization of a constant, and without more context, it does not raise any specific security concerns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  static const parser_settings_t settings;
#ifdef NODE_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP
  static const uint64_t kMaxHeaderSize = 8 * 1024;
#endif  /* NODE_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP */
};

const parser_settings_t Parser::settings = {
