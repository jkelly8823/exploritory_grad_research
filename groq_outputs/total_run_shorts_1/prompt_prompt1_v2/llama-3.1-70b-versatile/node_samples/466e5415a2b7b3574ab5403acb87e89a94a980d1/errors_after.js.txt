VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The code defines a custom error using a function that doesn't handle potential exceptions or edge cases, leaving room for unintended behavior or information disclosure.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, the `E` function is used to define new error types. However, when defining `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`, a function is provided as the second argument. This function creates properties (`reason`, `host`, and `cert`) on the error object, potentially exposing sensitive information about the certificate and host. This could allow an attacker to learn more about the system and its configurations than intended.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider using a more secure method to handle error information, such as not directly exposing sensitive information on the error object.
2. Validate the input provided to the function to prevent potential security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks.
3. Consider implementing additional error handling and logging to prevent unintended behavior.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
E('ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END', 'write after end', Error);
E('ERR_SYNTHETIC', 'JavaScript Callstack', Error);
E('ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR', 'A system error occurred', SystemError);
E('ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_FORMAT', 'Invalid subject alternative name string',
  SyntaxError);
E('ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID', function(reason, host, cert) {
  this.reason = reason;
  this.host = host;
  this.cert = cert;
