VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 24-26
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a certificate validation issue due to the fact that it uses a simple string prefix check to extract DNS names from the subjectAltName extension in the certificate. This can lead to incorrect or incomplete validation of the certificate, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass certificate validation checks.

EXPLANATION:
The code splits the subjectAltName extension into individual names and checks each name to see if it starts with 'DNS:' or 'URI:'. However, this check is not sufficient to guarantee that the name is a valid DNS name or URI. An attacker could potentially manipulate the subjectAltName extension to include a DNS name that does not start with 'DNS:', but is still a valid DNS name. Additionally, the code does not perform any validation on the extracted DNS names, such as checking if they match the expected format. This lack of validation can lead to incorrect or incomplete validation of the certificate.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a more robust method to extract and validate the DNS names from the subjectAltName extension. This can include using a regular expression to match the DNS names, and then validating the extracted names to ensure they match the expected format. Additionally, the code should also validate the DNS names against the expected hostname to ensure that the certificate is valid for the intended hostname.
