VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 
None of the presented code snippets contain any specific vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
 
After reviewing the code snippets, I found that the provided code seems to be handling certificate extensions and printing out subject alternative names and info access information. It uses the OpenSSL library for this purpose.

The code appears to properly handle and escape any potentially malicious input and does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The `PrintAltName` function properly escape any special characters in the input string, which prevents potential injection attacks.

However, I have not reviewed the code in detail, and there might be potential issues depending on how it is used in a larger context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

* The code should be reviewed more thoroughly in its larger context.
* All user input should be validated before being used in the code.
* Any potential vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the code (such as OpenSSL) should be taken into account.
