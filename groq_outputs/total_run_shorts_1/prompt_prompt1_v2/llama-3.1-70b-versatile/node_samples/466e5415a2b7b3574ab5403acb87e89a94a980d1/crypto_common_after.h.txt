VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet contains function declarations for handling X.509 certificate information. No vulnerable code paths or patterns were detected. All the functions appear to follow proper protocol and the variable names and function parameters seem to be appropriately declared.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for security fixes are needed for this code snippet. However, it is recommended to examine the implementation of these functions to ensure they handle potential errors and exceptions correctly.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Object> GetRawDERCertificate(Environment* env, X509* cert);

v8::Local<v8::Value> ToV8Value(Environment* env, const BIOPointer& bio);
bool SafeX509SubjectAltNamePrint(const BIOPointer& out, X509_EXTENSION* ext);

v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Value> GetSubject(
    Environment* env,
    const BIOPointer& bio,
    const BIOPointer& bio,
    X509* cert);

v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Value> GetSubjectAltNameString(
    Environment* env,
    const BIOPointer& bio,
    X509* cert);

v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Value> GetInfoAccessString(
    Environment* env,
    const BIOPointer& bio,
    X509* cert);
