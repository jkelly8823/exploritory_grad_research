VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to an unhandled exception when handling socket errors.
EXPLANATION:
The socketOnError function is intended to handle socket errors, but it is not wrapped in a try-catch block and does not handle all potential exceptions. This could potentially lead to an unhandled exception when a case that is not specified in the switch statement occurs. The code does not specify what should happen in the case of other exceptions that are not specifically handled, leaving it to the caller to catch or ignoring other potential errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a try-catch block around the code in socketOnError to handle any potential exceptions that may occur. Additionally, consider adding a catch-all clause to handle any cases that are not specifically listed in the switch statement.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  
  'Connection: close\r\n\r\n', 'ascii',
);

function socketOnError(e) {
  // Ignore further errors
  this.removeListener('error', socketOnError);

        case 'HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW':
          response = requestHeaderFieldsTooLargeResponse;
          break;
        case 'ERR_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT':
          response = requestTimeoutResponse;
          break;
        default:
