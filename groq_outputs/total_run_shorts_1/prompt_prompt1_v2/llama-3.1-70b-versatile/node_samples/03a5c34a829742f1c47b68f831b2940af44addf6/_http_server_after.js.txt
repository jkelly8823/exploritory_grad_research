VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains a potential denial of service (DoS) vulnerability due to the way it handles HTTP header overflows.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of an HTTP server implementation, handling various error cases. However, the way it handles header overflows (`'HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW'` and `'HPE_CHUNK_EXTENSIONS_OVERFLOW'`) only sets a response variable, but does not actually terminate the connection or take any other action to prevent the malicious request from continuing to consume resources.

An attacker could exploit this by sending a large number of requests with overflowing headers, potentially causing the server to exhaust its resources and become unavailable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the server should immediately terminate the connection when a header overflow is detected, without allowing the request to continue. Here is an updated version of the vulnerable code:
```javascript
case 'HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW':
  response = requestHeaderFieldsTooLargeResponse;
  this.destroy(); // Terminate the connection
  break;
case 'HPE_CHUNK_EXTENSIONS_OVERFLOW':
  response = requestChunkExtensionsTooLargeResponse;
  this.destroy(); // Terminate the connection
  break;
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```javascript
'Connection: close\r\n\r\n', 'ascii',
);

const requestChunkExtensionsTooLargeResponse = Buffer.from(
  `HTTP/1.1 413 ${STATUS_CODES[413]}\r\n` +
  'Connection: close\r\n\r\n', 'ascii',
);

function socketOnError(e) {
  // Ignore further errors
  this.removeListener('error', socketOnError);

        case 'HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW':
          response = requestHeaderFieldsTooLargeResponse;
          break;
        case 'HPE_CHUNK_EXTENSIONS_OVERFLOW':
          response = requestChunkExtensionsTooLargeResponse;
          break;
        case 'ERR_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT':
          response = requestTimeoutResponse;
          break;
        default:
```
