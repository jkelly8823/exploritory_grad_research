VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of freed memory and uninitialized pointer 'ret' in BUF_MEM_new function.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided has multiple vulnerabilities. 
Firstly, the provided function seems to be incomplete as it is missing the return type and the function parameters. However, analyzing the provided code, the 'str' pointer seems to be used without initialization or definition in this snippet.
Furthermore, the function seems to return an integer as it calls 'return(len);' which might be a mistake as the function name and declaration indicate it should return a pointer to BUF_MEM. If the function is intended to return a BUF_MEM pointer, using 'return(len);' is incorrect and will result in returning garbage values.
Also, there is an uninitialized pointer variable 'ret' being used. The pointer 'ret' is used in the function regardless of whether the 'str->data == NULL' condition is met or not, but in one of the two cases, 'ret' is assigned a new memory address using 'OPENSSL_malloc()'. However, if 'str->data != NULL', then 'ret' will still be used but without being initialized. This results in use of uninitialized memory.
Another potential issue is 'str->length=len' which is not checked for errors in this function snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate that 'str' is initialized and not NULL before using it. This could be handled as an input parameter validation.
2. Correct the return statements in the function. If the function is supposed to return BUF_MEM pointer, use 'return ret' instead of 'return(len)'.
3. Initialize 'ret' properly before it's used in the function. The initialization should depend on 'str->data == NULL' check.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include "cryptlib.h"
#include <openssl/buffer.h>

/* LIMIT_BEFORE_EXPANSION is the maximum n such that (n+3)/3*4 < 2**31. That
 * function is applied in several functions in this file and this limit ensures
 * that the result fits in an int. */
#define LIMIT_BEFORE_EXPANSION 0x5ffffffc

BUF_MEM *BUF_MEM_new(void)
	{
	BUF_MEM *ret;

		str->length=len;
		return(len);
		}
	/* This limit is sufficient to ensure (len+3)/3*4 < 2**31 */
	if (len > LIMIT_BEFORE_EXPANSION)
		{
		BUFerr(BUF_F_BUF_MEM_GROW,ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE);
		return 0;
		}
	n=(len+3)/3*4;
	if (str->data == NULL)
		ret=OPENSSL_malloc(n);
	else
		str->length=len;
		return(len);
		}
	/* This limit is sufficient to ensure (len+3)/3*4 < 2**31 */
	if (len > LIMIT_BEFORE_EXPANSION)
		{
		BUFerr(BUF_F_BUF_MEM_GROW_CLEAN,ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE);
		return 0;
		}
	n=(len+3)/3*4;
	if (str->data == NULL)
		ret=OPENSSL_malloc(n);
	else
