VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6, 10, 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function `BUF_MEM_new` is attempting to allocate memory for a buffer using `OPENSSL_malloc` but does not check if the allocation was successful. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if the allocation fails.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be implementing a base64 encoding function using OpenSSL's `BUF_MEM` type. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the allocation of memory for the `BUF_MEM` structure is not checked for success. If the `OPENSSL_malloc` function fails to allocate memory, a null pointer will be returned, which can cause a segmentation fault or null pointer dereference if used.

The lines at issue are lines 6, 10, and 14, which all attempt to allocate memory without checking the result.

Additionally, the code appears to have multiple unrelated or duplicate sections, suggesting that it may be the result of a partial merge or incomplete code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Always check the result of a memory allocation function to ensure it was successful.
2. Consider using a wrapper function or macro to check the allocation result and handle failures.
3. Remove duplicate or unrelated code sections to improve maintainability and correctness.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include "cryptlib.h"
#include <openssl/buffer.h>

BUF_MEM *BUF_MEM_new(void)
	{
	BUF_MEM *ret;

		str->length=len;
		return(len);
		}
	n=(len+3)/3*4;
	if (str->data == NULL)
		ret=OPENSSL_malloc(n);
	else
		str->length=len;
		return(len);
		}
	n=(len+3)/3*4;
	if (str->data == NULL)
		ret=OPENSSL_malloc(n);
	else
```
