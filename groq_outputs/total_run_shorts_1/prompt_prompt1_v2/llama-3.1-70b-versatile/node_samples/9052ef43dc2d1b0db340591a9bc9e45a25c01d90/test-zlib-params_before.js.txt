VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Information Disclosure due to assert strict equality in a non-secure environment.

EXPLANATION:
The use of `assert.deepStrictEqual` in a non-secure environment, such as this code snippet, can potentially lead to an Information Disclosure vulnerability. When an assertion fails, the `assert` module will throw an error with a detailed message that includes the expected and actual values. If an attacker has some influence over the `actual` or `expected` values, this could lead to information disclosure. Additionally, it's worth noting that `assert` is typically used for debugging purposes, and should not be used in production code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Do not use `assert` module in production code.
- Instead of using `assert`, consider using a secure way to verify the integrity of the data. This could involve using a secure method to compare the actual and expected values.
- Ensure that any error messages that could potentially be exposed to attackers are sanitized and do not include sensitive information.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
const chunk1 = file.slice(0, chunkSize);
const chunk2 = file.slice(chunkSize);
const blkhdr = Buffer.from([0x00, 0x5a, 0x82, 0xa5, 0x7d]);
const expected = Buffer.concat([blkhdr, chunk2]);
let actual;

deflater.write(chunk1, function() {
  deflater.params(0, zlib.constants.Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY, function() {
    while (deflater.read());
    deflater.end(chunk2, function() {
      const bufs = [];
      let buf;
      while ((buf = deflater.read()) !== null)
        bufs.push(buf);
      actual = Buffer.concat(bufs);
    });
  });
  while (deflater.read());
});

process.once('exit', function() {
  assert.deepStrictEqual(actual, expected);
});
```
