VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure HTTP/2 Header Handling, specifically related to CVE-2019-9514 and CVE-2019-9516 vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines a macro `SECURITY_REVERSIONS` which includes HTTP/2 security reversion comments for CVE-2019-9514 and CVE-2019-9516. While this itself is not an active vulnerability, it indicates that the current code may not be handling these vulnerabilities properly or was patched in the past. However, without the implementation of the actual HTTP/2 protocol, it's hard to say if these are properly mitigated.

The issue is that when reversing security fixes for these commits without proper handling, it increases the risk of being vulnerable to these two CVEs.

Furthermore, the TODO comment indicates that these vulnerabilities may be reintroduced in the future when Node.js 13 is no longer supported, if the TODO item is not addressed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Verify and test actual HTTP/2 protocol implementation, making sure it handles the mentioned CVEs.
2. Ensure proper mitigations are in place for these CVEs before reversing security reversion items.
3. Consider rewriting the TODO item to a warning to revert the comments or add any necessary logic to handle HTTP/2 security in the future.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define SECURITY_REVERSIONS(XX)                                            \
  XX(CVE_2019_9514, "CVE-2019-9514", "HTTP/2 Reset Flood")                 \
  XX(CVE_2019_9516, "CVE-2019-9516", "HTTP/2 0-Length Headers Leak")       \
//  XX(CVE_2016_PEND, "CVE-2016-PEND", "Vulnerability Title")
  // TODO(addaleax): Remove all of the above before Node.js 13 as the comment
  // at the start of the file indicates.
