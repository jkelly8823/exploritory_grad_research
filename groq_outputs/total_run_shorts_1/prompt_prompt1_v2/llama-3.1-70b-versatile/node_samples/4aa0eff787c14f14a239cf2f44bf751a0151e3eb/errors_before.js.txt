VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be defining a set of error codes for a Node.js application. It uses an undefined function `E()` to create error messages. Given the provided snippet, there is no indication of any potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, or error handling issues. 
However, without seeing the definition of the `E()` function, we can't confirm its safety. Assuming it properly handles the creation of these error messages and does not introduce any vulnerabilities elsewhere in the codebase, this snippet appears secure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
For improved code security, it is recommended that all imports and function declarations are included and use secure practices for error handling. However, no specific security-related recommendations can be made for this particular snippet based on the information provided.
