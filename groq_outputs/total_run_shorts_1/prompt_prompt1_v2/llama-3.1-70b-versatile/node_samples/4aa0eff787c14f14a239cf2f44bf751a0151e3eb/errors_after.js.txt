VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The provided code snippet does not appear to contain any known security vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code defines custom error messages for Node.js, using the E() function to create the error messages. Each error message is assigned a unique error code and associated with a particular error type (Error or TypeError). No obvious security vulnerabilities are present in this code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific security recommendations are required for this code snippet. However, as a best practice, it is recommended to handle these custom error types throughout the application to prevent any potential security issues that may arise from unhandled errors.
ORIGINAL CODE:

//
// Note: Node.js specific errors must begin with the prefix ERR_

E('ERR_ARG_NOT_ITERABLE', '%s must be iterable', TypeError);
E('ERR_ASSERTION', '%s', Error);
E('ERR_ASYNC_CALLBACK', '%s must be a function', TypeError);
