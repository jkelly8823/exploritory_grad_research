VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure indirect use of X509_get_pubkey.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet uses the `X509_get_pubkey` function from OpenSSL to extract the public key from an X509 certificate. This function returns a pointer to an `EVP_PKEY` struct without incrementing its internal reference count. This is an indirect use and is considered insecure as there is no error checking after calling `X509_get_pubkey`.

However, a more direct vulnerability exists. This code can lead to a memory corruption due to the X509_get_pubkey function being able to return a NULL pointer, in cases where certificate is corrupted, etc. But there's no checking if the returned pkey is NULL before usage in EVPKeyPointer and then in ManagedEVPPKey.

OpenSSL documentation recommends against using this function directly. Instead, applications should use the PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX or the OpenSSL public key functions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Before using the returned `EVP_PKEY` struct, ensure that it is not NULL and has a valid reference count.
- Use `X509_get0_pubkey` instead to avoid incrementing the reference count manually.
- Instead of directly calling `X509_get_pubkey`, consider extracting public key from a certificate using public key functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:

  X509Certificate* cert;
  ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP(&cert, args.Holder());

  EVPKeyPointer pkey(X509_get_pubkey(cert->get()));
  ManagedEVPPKey epkey(std::move(pkey));
  std::shared_ptr<KeyObjectData> key_data =
      KeyObjectData::CreateAsymmetric(kKeyTypePublic, epkey);
