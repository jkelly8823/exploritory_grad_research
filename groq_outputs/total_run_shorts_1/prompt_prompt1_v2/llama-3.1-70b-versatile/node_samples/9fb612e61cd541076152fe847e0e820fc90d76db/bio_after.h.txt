VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet does not appear to contain any known security vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a conditional compilation block for a specific C compiler (GNUC) and version of the C standard (STDC_VERSION). It seems to be checking the compatibility of the compiler with the 'z' modifier of the __attribute__ directive, which was introduced in C99.

There is no apparent vulnerability in this snippet. The conditions and preprocessor directives used here are typical in C programming and do not seem to pose any security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
# define ossl_bio__attr__(x)
# if defined(__GNUC__) && defined(__STDC_VERSION__) \
    && !defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(__MINGW64__) \
    && !defined(__APPLE__)
    /*
     * Because we support the 'z' modifier, which made its appearance in C99,
     * we can't use __attribute__ with pre C99 dialects.
