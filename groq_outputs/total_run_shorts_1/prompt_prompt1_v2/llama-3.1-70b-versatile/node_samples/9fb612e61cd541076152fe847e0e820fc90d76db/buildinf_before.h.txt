The provided code snippet includes two `#define` directives, which are used to define preprocessor macros. There is no indication of a vulnerability in this code. The variables defined here seem to hold versioning or version metadata information for the build, which does not pose a security risk.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#define PLATFORM "platform: linux64-s390x"
#define DATE "built on: Fri Jul  8 16:49:20 2022 UTC"

/*
 * Generate compiler_flags as an array of individual characters. This is a
 * workaround for the situation where CFLAGS gets too long for a C90 string
```
Note: Since the code provided is incomplete and only includes `#define` directives, there's nothing to analyze for potential vulnerabilities like injection attacks or buffer overflows.
