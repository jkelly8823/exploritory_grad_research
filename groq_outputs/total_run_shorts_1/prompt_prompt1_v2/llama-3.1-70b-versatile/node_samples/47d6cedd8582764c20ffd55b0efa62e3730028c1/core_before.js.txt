VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of a hardcoded HTTP response for unknown protocols
EXPLANATION:
The code provides an unhandled error response for unknown protocols when a socket error occurs, sending a hardcoded HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden message with 'Content-Type: text/plain'. While sending an HTTP response for HTTP/1.0-based servers is not necessarily the issue here, in certain contexts, directly sending network plaintext could accidentally reveal internal server information or sensitive data.

However, there is more pronounced issue. This potentially reveals internal workings of an affected server if an attacker would be able to trigger and therefore understand a scenario for an 'unknown protocol'. This introduces an insecure information disclosure vulnerability.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
In order to fix this vulnerability, you should avoid revealing potential server details in such an error response. Implementing an alternative and less revealing HTTP error response is recommended.

1. Modify the error response so that it does not reveal anything about the server's capability or its intent. For example:
```javascript
    'HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n';
```

Or even no text message back at all might be safest of all in terms of minimizing details:

```javascript
    'HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n';
```

ORIGINAL CODE:

```javascript
const net = require('net');
const { Duplex } = require('stream');
const tls = require('tls');
const { setImmediate } = require('timers');

const {
  kIncomingMessage,
  _checkIsHttpToken: checkIsHttpToken
    this.emit('continue');
}

const setTimeout = {
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true,
  writable: true,
  value: setStreamTimeout
};
ObjectDefineProperty(Http2Stream.prototype, 'setTimeout', setTimeout);
ObjectDefineProperty(Http2Session.prototype, 'setTimeout', setTimeout);


// When the socket emits an error, destroy the associated Http2Session and
// forward it the same error.
    debug('Unknown protocol from %s:%s',
          socket.remoteAddress, socket.remotePort);
    if (!this.emit('unknownProtocol', socket)) {
      // We don't know what to do, so let's just tell the other side what's
      // going on in a format that they *might* understand.
      socket.end('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden\r\n' +
                 'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n' +
    );
  }

  // Used only with allowHTTP1
  options.Http1IncomingMessage = options.Http1IncomingMessage ||
    http.IncomingMessage;
  options.Http1ServerResponse = options.Http1ServerResponse ||
```
