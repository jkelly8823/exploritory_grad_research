VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
No obvious vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet. The code appears to define an interface and implement its methods without any apparent security issues. The only potential concern could be the lack of input validation in some of the methods, such as `SetIndexOffset` and `SetKey`, which could potentially lead to issues if the input values are not properly validated elsewhere in the code. However, based on the provided code snippet alone, there are no visible vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As the code does not currently appear to have any vulnerabilities, no specific fixes are recommended. However, to improve the overall security and robustness of the code, adding input validation in methods such as `SetIndexOffset` and `SetKey` could help ensure the code behaves as expected even with invalid inputs.
