VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Potential HTTP response splitting vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
 The code is constructing an HTTP status line using the `statusCode` variable and `statusMessage` property. If these values are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious data, such as a newline character (`\n` or `\r`) or a separate HTTP request. This could lead to HTTP response splitting attacks, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers or even a new HTTP request. Although the code checks the `statusCode` value, it does not validate or sanitize the `statusMessage` property. Therefore, the `statusMessage` property may contain malicious data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to properly validate and sanitize the `statusMessage` property. This can be achieved by removing or escaping any newline characters and trimming unnecessary whitespace. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to allow only a predefined set of HTTP status messages.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```javascript
if (statusCode < 100 || statusCode > 999)
  throw new RangeError(`Invalid status code: ${statusCode}`);

var statusLine = 'HTTP/1.1 ' + statusCode.toString() + ' ' +
                 this.statusMessage + CRLF;

if (statusCode === 204 || statusCode === 304 ||
