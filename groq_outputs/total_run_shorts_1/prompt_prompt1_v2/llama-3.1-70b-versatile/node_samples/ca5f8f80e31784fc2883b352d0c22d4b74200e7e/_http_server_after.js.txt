VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be related to HTTP status code handling, specifically validation and construction of a status line. It checks for valid status codes, checks the status message for invalid characters, and then constructs the status line. The code seems well-structured and does not appear to contain any apparent vulnerabilities, such as injection or buffer overflow vulnerabilities, given the provided context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided as no vulnerabilities were found. However, it is worth noting that input validation should always be performed on user-provided data (in this case, `statusCode` and `statusMessage`). If these values come from an untrusted source, additional validation and sanitization should be considered to prevent potential security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
  if (statusCode < 100 || statusCode > 999)
    throw new RangeError(`Invalid status code: ${statusCode}`);

  if (common._checkInvalidHeaderChar(this.statusMessage))
    throw new Error('Invalid character in statusMessage.');

  var statusLine = 'HTTP/1.1 ' + statusCode.toString() + ' ' +
                   this.statusMessage + CRLF;

  if (statusCode === 204 || statusCode === 304 ||
