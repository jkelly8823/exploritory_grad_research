VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No known vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a part of a C or C++ header file that defines versioning information for a Node.js-like system. The code defines several macros that specify the major, minor, and patch versions of the system. It also defines a macro to determine if a release version has been made. The final two macros define stringification of a macro.

Upon reviewing the code, no apparent vulnerabilities have been identified. The code is mostly comprised of preprocessor definitions, which are generally not vulnerable to security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are provided since no vulnerabilities have been identified.
