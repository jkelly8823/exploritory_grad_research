VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a permission management system, using C++ as the programming language. It involves creating shared pointers to permission objects and inserting these objects into a map. The use of the `std::make_shared` function to create shared_ptr objects is safe and properly follows RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.

The remaining code defines several permission categories and inserts corresponding objects into the nodes_ map. The use of macros such as `FILESYSTEM_PERMISSIONS(V)` and `WORKER_THREADS_PERMISSIONS(V)` to generate repetitive code seems to be a convenient and safe pattern, as long as the underlying definitions do not introduce any vulnerabilities.

However, the `Environmental* env` function parameter in the last code block may be a source of potential issues in a larger context. Its ownership and lifetime might lead to memory leaks or dangling pointers, but based on this isolated snippet, it does not raise any alarms.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet, there are no specific recommendations for this particular segment. However, it's essential to ensure the correctness and safety of the surrounding code, including the usage of the `env` pointer and the definition of permission classes.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
std::make_shared<ChildProcessPermission>();
  std::shared_ptr<PermissionBase> worker_t =
      std::make_shared<WorkerPermission>();
  std::shared_ptr<PermissionBase> inspector =
      std::make_shared<InspectorPermission>();
#define V(Name, _, __)                                                         \
  nodes_.insert(std::make_pair(PermissionScope::k##Name, fs));
  FILESYSTEM_PERMISSIONS(V)
#undef V
  nodes_.insert(std::make_pair(PermissionScope::k##Name, worker_t));
  WORKER_THREADS_PERMISSIONS(V)
#undef V
#define V(Name, _, __)                                                         \
  nodes_.insert(std::make_pair(PermissionScope::k##Name, inspector));
  INSPECTOR_PERMISSIONS(V)
#undef V
}
void Permission::ThrowAccessDenied(Environment* env,
                                   PermissionScope perm,
```

Note that the given code seems incomplete since the closing bracket of the first block and the function body of ThrowAccessDenied are not provided.
