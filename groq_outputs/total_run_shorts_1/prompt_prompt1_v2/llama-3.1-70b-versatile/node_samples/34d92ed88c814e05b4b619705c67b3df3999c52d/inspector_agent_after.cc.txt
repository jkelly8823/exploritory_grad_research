VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION: The code snippet appears to be a part of a C++ class that handles inspector-related functionality. The code includes permission checks, error handling, and various methods for interacting with inspector sessions and handles. After analyzing the code, no evident vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or other common security issues were found. The code seems to properly handle permissions, checks, and error cases.
RECOMMENDATIONS: No specific recommendations for vulnerabilities are necessary. However, as good practice, ensure proper input validation and sanitization for any input parameters (thread_id, url, name) in methods like `GetParentHandle`. Additionally, ensure that the `ThrowUninitializedInspectorError` and `THROW_IF_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` macros are properly implemented and handle error conditions correctly.
