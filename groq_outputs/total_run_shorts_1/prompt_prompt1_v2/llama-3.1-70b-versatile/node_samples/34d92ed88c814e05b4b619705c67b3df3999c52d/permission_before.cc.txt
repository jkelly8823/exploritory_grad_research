VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identifiable vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a larger C++ class responsible for managing permissions. It uses a macro to insert permission scopes and corresponding permissions into a map. The code also includes instances of std::shared_ptr usage, which is a safe and recommended way to manage memory in modern C++.

While it is impossible to be absolutely certain about the safety of this code without more context, the snippet itself does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The use of std::shared_ptr, std::make_shared, and a map to store permissions suggests that the code is well-written and follows best practices for memory management.

It is worth noting that potential issues may arise if the `nodes_` map is accessed or modified by multiple threads concurrently, but this would be a broader concern that cannot be evaluated based on this snippet alone.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
