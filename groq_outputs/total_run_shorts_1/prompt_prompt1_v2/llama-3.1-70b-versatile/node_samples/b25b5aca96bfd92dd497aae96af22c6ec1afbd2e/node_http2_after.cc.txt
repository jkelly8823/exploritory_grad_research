VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was found in the given code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be the destructor of an `Http2Session` class. It properly cleans up resources by detaching and clearing streams, and resetting the session. There are no obvious indicators of common vulnerabilities such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, or null pointer dereferences. However, it is essential to note that the lack of surrounding code does limit the extent of the analysis.

The `CHECK`, `CHECK_EQ`, `Debug`, and other undefined functions are assumed to be valid and properly implemented in the context of this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommended fixes for this code, as it appears to be well-structured and properly handling resource cleanup. However, ensure that the `CHECK` and `CHECK_EQ` assertions are properly implemented elsewhere in the codebase to prevent potential issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
Http2Session::~Http2Session() {
  CHECK(!is_in_scope());
  Debug(this, "freeing nghttp2 session");
  // Ensure that all `Http2Stream` instances and the memory they hold
  // on to are destroyed before the nghttp2 session is.
  for (const auto& [id, stream] : streams_) {
    stream->Detach();
  }
  streams_.clear();
  // Explicitly reset session_ so the subsequent
  // current_nghttp2_memory_ check passes.
  session_.reset();
  CHECK_EQ(current_nghttp2_memory_, 0);
}
```
