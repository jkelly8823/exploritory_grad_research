VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No specific vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a destructor for an `Http2Session` class. It checks if the session is not in scope before proceeding with freeing resources. The `CHECK` and `CHECK_EQ` macros are used to ensure certain conditions are met before continuing. There doesn't appear to be any obvious security vulnerability or programming error in this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the code snippet provided, there are no specific recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities. However, to improve code security, consider adding error handling to handle potential issues when freeing resources.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
Http2Session::~Http2Session() {
  CHECK(!is_in_scope());
  Debug(this, "freeing nghttp2 session");
  // Explicitly reset session_ so the subsequent
  // current_nghttp2_memory_ check passes.
  session_.reset();
  CHECK_EQ(current_nghttp2_memory_, 0);
}
```
