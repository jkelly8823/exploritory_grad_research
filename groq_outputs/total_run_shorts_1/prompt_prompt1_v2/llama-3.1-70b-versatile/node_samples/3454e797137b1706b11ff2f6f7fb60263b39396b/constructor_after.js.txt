VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Prototype Pollution Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the use of `ObjectCreate(null)`. This line of code creates a new object with no prototype. However, it then uses this object as a map, potentially with user-controlled data. Later, the code uses `ObjectDefineProperties` (not shown in this snippet, but implied by its presence in the import list) or other methods that may be used to add properties to this object. This can lead to potential prototype pollution if an attacker can manipulate the keys used to store data in this object.
Furthermore, the code uses `ObjectKeys(tabularData)` to retrieve an array of keys from the `tabularData` object. This can also potentially lead to prototype pollution if `tabularData` has been manipulated to contain malicious keys.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following:
1. Freeze the object before using it as a map to prevent any prototype chain manipulation: `const map = ObjectCreate(null); ObjectPreventExtensions(map);`
2. Verify that the keys used to store data in the `map` object are sanitized and validated to prevent any potential prototype pollution.
3. When using `ObjectKeys`, ensure that the object being iterated over has not been manipulated to contain malicious keys.
