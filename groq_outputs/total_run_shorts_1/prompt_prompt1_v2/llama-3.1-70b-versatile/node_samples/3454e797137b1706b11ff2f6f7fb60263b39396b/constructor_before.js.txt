VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 9-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential information exposure through indirect reference to all object properties using Object.keys().

EXPLANATION:
The use of `Object.keys(tabularData)` directly exposes information about the object's structure without filtering. This could result in unwanted exposure of sensitive information if the object contains both public and private keys. However, without more context, the severity of this vulnerability cannot be fully assessed.

In addition, while not strictly a vulnerability, using `Object.keys(tabularData)` followed by iterating over the result with `valuesKeyArray` and `indexKeyArray` may lead to issues with enumerability if not properly checked.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Potentially, instead of directly using `Object.keys(tabularData)`, define the expected keys and iterate over those instead. This could significantly reduce information exposure risks.
- Use a more efficient method for iterating over the `tabularData` if performance is a concern, considering filtering sensitive information if it's present.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
MathFloor,
Number,
NumberPrototypeToFixed,
ObjectDefineProperties,
ObjectDefineProperty,
ObjectKeys,
ObjectPrototypeHasOwnProperty,
      return final([iterKey, valuesKey], [getIndexArray(length), values]);
    }

    const map = {};
    let hasPrimitives = false;
    const valuesKeyArray = [];
    const indexKeyArray = ObjectKeys(tabularData);
```
