VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Buffer Overflow due to Missing Argument Validation.
EXPLANATION:
The `send_in_chunks` function is invoked with two arguments: a character array (`INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST.c_str()`) and its length (`INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST.length()`). However, the second invocation in the `TEST_F(InspectorSocketTest, HostIPNonRoutable)` test case is missing the closing parenthesis for the second argument. This omission could potentially allow an attacker to pass a malicious or unexpected value for the length argument, which may lead to a buffer overflow.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add the missing closing parenthesis to correctly invoke the `send_in_chunks` function.

```cpp
send_in_chunks(INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST.c_str(),
               INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST.length());
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
TEST_F(InspectorSocketTest, HostIPNonRoutable) {
  const std::string INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST = "GET /json HTTP/1.1\r\n"
                                              "Host: 0.0.0.0:9229\r\n\r\n";
  send_in_chunks(INVALID_HOST_IP_REQUEST.c_str(),
  expect_handshake_failure();
}
```
