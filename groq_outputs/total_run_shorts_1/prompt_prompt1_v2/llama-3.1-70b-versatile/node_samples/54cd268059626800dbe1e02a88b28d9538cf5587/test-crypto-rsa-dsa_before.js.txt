VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate Error Handling and Potential Private Key Exposure
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet does not handle potential decryption errors properly. If the decryption operation fails for some reason (e.g., incorrect key or corrupted data), the code will throw an exception without any meaningful error handling. This could potentially lead to sensitive information being disclosed or the exposure of the private key.

Moreover, the code uses both `rsaKeyPem` and `rsaPkcs8KeyPem` keys for decryption. If the encryption was performed using a different key or algorithm, this could lead to errors or even silent failures.

Additionally, the use of `assert.deepStrictEqual` for verifying the decrypted data against the original input can lead to sensitive information being exposed through error messages in case of failure.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Implement proper error handling for the `crypto.privateDecrypt` operations by wrapping them in try-catch blocks and handling potential errors accordingly.

2. Verify that the encryption and decryption keys match the expected formats and algorithms.

3. Instead of using `assert.deepStrictEqual`, compare the decrypted data against the original input securely using a constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent potential timing attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
oaepHash: encryptOaepHash
  }, bufferToEncrypt);

  let decryptedBuffer = crypto.privateDecrypt({
    key: rsaKeyPem,
    padding: padding,
    oaepHash: decryptOaepHash
  }, encryptedBuffer);
  assert.deepStrictEqual(decryptedBuffer, input);

  decryptedBuffer = crypto.privateDecrypt({
    key: rsaPkcs8KeyPem,
    padding: padding,
    oaepHash: decryptOaepHash
  }, encryptedBuffer);
  assert.deepStrictEqual(decryptedBuffer, input);
}
