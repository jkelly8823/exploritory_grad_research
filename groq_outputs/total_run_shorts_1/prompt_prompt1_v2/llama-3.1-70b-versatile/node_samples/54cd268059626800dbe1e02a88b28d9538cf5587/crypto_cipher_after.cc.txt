VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6, 10-15, 19-20
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet contains multiple potential vulnerabilities, including insecure use of RSA_PKCS1_PADDING with private key decryption and the use of `EVP_get_digestbyname` which can be vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Additionally, the control statement in line 10 to set `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection` might fail and return an error, potentially causing the code to continue executing with the default behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The use of RSA_PKCS1_PADDING with private key decryption is considered insecure and has been deprecated due to vulnerabilities such as Bleichenbacher's attack. This padding scheme should be replaced with a more secure alternative like OAEP.

Furthermore, the use of `EVP_get_digestbyname` function can be vulnerable to spoofing attacks. The `EVP_get_digestbyname` function does not perform any validation on the input, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause the program to use a different digest algorithm than intended.

Additionally, the `EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str` function used to set `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection` might return an error, but the error is not properly handled. This can cause the code to continue executing with the default behavior, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.

The problem lies in how `rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection` is set and checked afterwards.

Similarly, we have another issue with the fact that there is no proper check for the content of the variable digest fetched from `EVP_get_digestbyname`. If this variable remains null after assignment then an error will not be thrown but will rather hit another error and panic another area.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended fix is to replace the use of RSA_PKCS1_PADDING with a more secure padding scheme like OAEP. Also, consider using `EVP_get_digestbynid` instead of `EVP_get_digestbyname` to avoid spoofing attacks. Additionally, the error returned by `EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str` should be properly handled to prevent the code from continuing to execute with the default behavior.

In the case that EPA_digetsnames contains invalid information then this could result in EVP_get_digestbyname returning null. It would be better to check this after having retrieved the value so that the full set of information that caused this error can be reported.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
uint32_t padding;

    operation == PublicKeyCipher::kPrivate && padding == RSA_PKCS1_PADDING) {

    return ThrowCryptoError(env, ERR_get_error());

  // From the doc -2 means that the option is not supported.
  // The default for the option is enabled and if it has been
  // specifically disabled we want to respect that so we will
  // not throw an error if the option is supported regardless
  // of how it is set. The call to set the value
  // will not affect what is used since a different context is
  // used in the call if the option is supported
  if (rsa_pkcs1_implicit_rejection <= 0) {
    return THROW_ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE(
        env,
        "RSA_PKCS1_PADDING is no longer supported for private decryption,"
        " this can be reverted with --security-revert=CVE-2024-PEND");

if (args[offset + 2]->IsString()) {
  const Utf8Value oaep_str(env->isolate(), args[offset + 2]);
