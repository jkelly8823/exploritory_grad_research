VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION: 
The provided code snippet is documentation commentary for command-line flags, specifically --no-experimental-repl-await and --experimental-specifier-resolution. It does not contain any executable code, and therefore, I could not detect any vulnerabilities. This snippet appears to be Markdown or YAML documentation for a project and is not actually code that can be executed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations needed.
