VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risk through untrusted input 'blockedFile' being used in the 'path.toNamespacedPath' function.

EXPLANATION:
The 'path.toNamespacedPath' function is likely being used to ensure that file paths are properly namespaced, which is a common practice in security-sensitive contexts. However, by passing an untrusted input 'blockedFile' to this function, an attacker may be able to inject malicious data that could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. While the code provided does not explicitly demonstrate an XSS vulnerability, the potential for one to exist is present.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the 'blockedFile' variable should be accurately validated and sanitized to ensure that it only contains expected and safe values. A more effective approach would be to implement a whitelisting strategy that only allows specific file names or patterns. If user input is allowed, then proper encoding and escaping should also be applied.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
