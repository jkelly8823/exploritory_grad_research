VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No known vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be testing fs-related functionality, specifically testing that `fs.openAsBlob` throws an error with an `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` code when operating on a blocked file. The fs methods used in this code snippet are correctly handling potential errors and checking for expected error codes. 

However, without more context such as the actual file system, the assert checks here seem appropriate and relevant for a file access protection method. Given the context of this code, no immediate concerns related to security stand out.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No concrete recommendations are made as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
}

// fs.openAsBlob
{
  assert.throws(() => {
    fs.openAsBlob(blockedFile);
  }, common.expectsError({
    code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
    permission: 'FileSystemRead',
    resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
}
```
