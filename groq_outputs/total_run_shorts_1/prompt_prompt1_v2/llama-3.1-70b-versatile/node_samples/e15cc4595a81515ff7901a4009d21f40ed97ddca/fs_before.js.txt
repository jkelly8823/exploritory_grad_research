VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Input - Path Traversal vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The `getValidatedPath(path)` function suggests that it validates the input, but the validation might be insufficient. Without the implementation details of the `getValidatedPath` function, it's difficult to say for sure. However, assuming it doesn't properly sanitize the input path, an attacker could potentially use a malicious path to access restricted files.

Additionally, the function `createBlobFromFilePath` seems to directly use the path without any further verification. If an attacker-controlled path is passed, it could allow them to access sensitive data.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ensure that the `getValidatedPath` function properly validates and sanitizes the input path to prevent path traversal
