VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-9
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code contains a vulnerability related to potential buffer overflow and data corruption. The constructor of the `AltSvcFrame` class allocates a buffer using `Buffer.alloc(size)` and then concatenates it with another buffer. This operation may lead to a buffer overflow or data corruption if the size of the allocated buffer is not properly validated or sanitized.

EXPLANATION:
The code allocates a buffer of a specified size using `Buffer.alloc(size)`. However, the code does not check or sanitize the provided size before allocating the buffer. This may lead to a situation where the allocated buffer is too large or too small for the intended use case, potentially causing a buffer overflow or data corruption. Additionally, the code concatenates the allocated buffer with another buffer, which may also cause issues if the concatenated buffer is too large or if the buffers are not properly aligned.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the provided size before allocating the buffer. Additionally, consider using a safer buffer concatenation method to prevent issues. Consider adding input validation checks to ensure that the provided size is within expected bounds and does not exceed a maximum allowed value.
```javascript
if (typeof size !== 'number' || size <= 0) {
  throw new Error('Invalid buffer size');
}
const bufferSize = Math.min(size, MAX_ALLOWED_BUFFER_SIZE);
const buffers = [Buffer.alloc(bufferSize)];
```
Consider replacing `MAX_ALLOWED_BUFFER_SIZE` with a sensible maximum value, depending on the specific use case and the maximum allowed buffer size.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
  }
}

class AltSvcFrame extends Frame {
  constructor(size) {
    const buffers = [Buffer.alloc(size)];
    super(size, 10, 0, 0);
    buffers.unshift(this[kFrameData]);
    this[kFrameData] = Buffer.concat(buffers);
  }
}

module.exports = {
  Frame,
  AltSvcFrame,
  DataFrame,
  HeadersFrame,
  SettingsFrame,
  PingFrame,
