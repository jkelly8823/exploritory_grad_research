VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a C++ code that defines a namespace `node`, a macro `SECURITY_REVERSIONS`, and an enumeration `reversion`. The code appears to be used to track security reversion information. The macro `SECURITY_REVERSIONS` is used to generate an enumeration of known security vulnerabilities. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflows, or format string attacks. There is no observable code paths that accept user input that needs validation or sanitization.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary as the code appears to be free of detectable vulnerabilities. However, it is still important to ensure that any user input that is used to populate the security reversion tracking system is validated and sanitized.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
namespace node {

#define SECURITY_REVERSIONS(XX)                                            \
  XX(CVE_2024_27980, "CVE_2024_27980", "Unsafe Windows batch file execution")
//  XX(CVE_2016_PEND, "CVE_2016_PEND", "Vulnerability Title")

enum reversion {
#define V(code, ...) SECURITY_REVERT_##code,
  SECURITY_REVERSIONS(V)
```
No issues or vulnerabilities were found in this code.
