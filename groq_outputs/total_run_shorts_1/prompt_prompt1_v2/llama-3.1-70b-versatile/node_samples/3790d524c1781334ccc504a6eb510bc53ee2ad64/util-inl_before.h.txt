VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Input and Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not properly validate the input filename before accessing its contents. Specifically, the strrchr function is used to find the last occurrence of '.' in the filename, and then StringEqualNoCase is used to compare the file extension to ".bat" and ".cmd" extensions. However, this check is not sufficient to prevent potential path traversal attacks, especially since the filename is not properly sanitized.

Moreover, the code does not check if the pointer p returned by strrchr is null before using it. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if strrchr does not find the '.' character in the filename.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend the following:

- Always validate and sanitize the input filename to prevent potential path traversal attacks.
- Check if the pointer p returned by strrchr is null before using it to prevent null pointer dereferences.
- Consider using a more robust method for getting the file extension, such as using the std::string::rfind method.

Additionally, it is recommended to normalize the filename to a canonical form before accessing its contents, to prevent potential issues with symbolic links or other types of path traversal.

ORIGINAL CODE:

  static constexpr bool kIsWindows = false;
#endif  // _WIN32
  if (kIsWindows)
    if (!IsReverted(SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2024_27980))
      if (const char* p = strrchr(filename, '.'))
        return StringEqualNoCase(p, ".bat") || StringEqualNoCase(p, ".cmd");
  return false;
}
