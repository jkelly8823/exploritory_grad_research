VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
A malicious HTTP request is being constructed to exploit vulnerabilities in a web server or application.

EXPLANATION:
This appears to be an HTTP request being constructed. However, several parts of this request are suspicious. The first issue is that 'HELOWORLDPOST' seems to be an intentionally misspelled version of 'HELLO WORLD' sent through the HTTP POST method. The reason we conclude this is likely misspelled is the client's HTTP version being 1.1 does not match the HTTP request (it appears to be an attempt at http protocol negotiation). Also HTTP/1.1 does not include 'POST / HTTP',  use of http protocol is suspect.
Secondly, we see there is no colon after 'POST' which is not the correct formatting for the HTTP protocol. Lastly 'eee' is most likely set to deliberately mislead, it does not exist within http requests as it does not match with http protocol '-transfer-encoding' set to either identity, chunked or deflate. Multiple such requests will crash many http servers which fail to validate headers, thus exploits' gain footholds.


However we have made one assumption that is potentially game changing: The formatting is most likely what we saw, this string would not fit in an environment with python using Http.server or flask to run from api calls.


Also important to note- this exploit could also mean client, given there does not exist much further client-server instructions; because this seems the most likely target one should assume there could be further maliciousness and or attack.


Please note that this data seems to be from wireshark, not from a standard text editor.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  Sanitize and validate all incoming data, especially HTTP requests. 
2. A new test, for the specific domain and service given should immediately be put into production then verified by someone, while constantly taking notes.
3. Test various attacks, and follow all standard business procedures to aid in detecting malicious attackers.
4. Monitor the web service being attacked since the request showed up in logging.
