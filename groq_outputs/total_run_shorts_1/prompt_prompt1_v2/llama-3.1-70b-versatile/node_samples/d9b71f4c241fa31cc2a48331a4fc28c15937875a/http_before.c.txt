VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure use of HTTP protocol due to incomplete validation of Transfer-Encoding header.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be part of an HTTP parser implementation. It checks for the presence of the Transfer-Encoding header in a request and verifies if the chunked transfer coding is not allowed due to lenient flags. However, the vulnerability arises from the fact that it does not check for the presence of other transfer codings that might be present in the header. This can lead to a potential attack where an adversary can inject malicious transfer codings, such as gzip or deflate, and bypass security checks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate the entire Transfer-Encoding header and not just check for the chunked transfer coding. This can be achieved by parsing the header and verifying that it only contains allowed transfer codings. Additionally, consider using a whitelisting approach to specify allowed transfer codings and reject any unknown or malicious ones.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    return 2;
  } else if (parser->flags & F_TRANSFER_ENCODING) {
    if (parser->type == HTTP_REQUEST &&
        (parser->lenient_flags & LENIENT_CHUNKED_LENGTH) == 0) {
