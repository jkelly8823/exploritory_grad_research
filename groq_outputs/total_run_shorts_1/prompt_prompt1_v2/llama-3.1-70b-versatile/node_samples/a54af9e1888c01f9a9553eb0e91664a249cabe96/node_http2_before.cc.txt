VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No potential vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a function that handles HTTP2 frames and checks for fatal error conditions. The logic is straightforward and there are no obvious vulnerabilities. The use of `nghttp2_is_fatal` and checking for `NGHTTP2_ERR_STREAM_CLOSED` error code suggests that the code is handling potential errors correctly. Additionally, the debug logging statement is not vulnerable as it's not directly related to user input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
  Http2Session* session = static_cast<Http2Session*>(user_data);

  Debug(session, "invalid frame received, code: %d", lib_error_code);

  // If the error is fatal or if error code is ERR_STREAM_CLOSED... emit error
  if (nghttp2_is_fatal(lib_error_code) ||
      lib_error_code == NGHTTP2_ERR_STREAM_CLOSED)
