VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No apparent vulnerability found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a declaration of a member variable `rejected_stream_count_` and two function declarations `CopyDataIntoOutgoing` and `ClearOutgoing`. There are no signs of potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or command injection. The code seems to simply declare variables and function signatures without actually executing any logic.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
  // misbehaving peer. This counter is reset once new streams are being
  // accepted again.
  int32_t rejected_stream_count_ = 0;

  void CopyDataIntoOutgoing(const uint8_t* src, size_t src_length);
  void ClearOutgoing(int status);
