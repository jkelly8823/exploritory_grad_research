VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a C++ class or struct, declaring member variables and function prototypes.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
// misbehaving peer. This counter is reset once new streams are being
// accepted again.
int32_t rejected_stream_count_ = 0;
// Also use the invalid frame count as a measure for rejecting input frames.
int32_t invalid_frame_count_ = 0;

void CopyDataIntoOutgoing(const uint8_t* src, size_t src_length);
void ClearOutgoing(int status);
