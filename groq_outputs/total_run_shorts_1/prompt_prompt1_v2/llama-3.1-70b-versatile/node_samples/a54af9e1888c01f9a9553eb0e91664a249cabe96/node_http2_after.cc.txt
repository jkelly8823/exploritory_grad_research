VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Denial of Service Vulnerability, specifically an excessive resource consumption vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability arises due to an open condition where the `invalid_frame_count_` can keep incrementing unchecked. This could be exploited by sending an attacker-supplied input stream of bogus frames. A combination of frequent frame transmissions and the 'CVE-2019-9514' revert condition could eventually increase the count beyond the '1000' threshold and hit the error handling endpoint; it's vital to include additional parameter checks or robust network error handling before `invalid_frame_count_` reaches certain threshold(s). This was observed within lines 4-5.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement a counter reset protocol. Occasionally reviewing the count and resetting under proper situations might be helpful in mitigating risk. Also take into consideration that a prolonged increase can potentially flag false positives which impact reliability.
2. Consider checking additional threshold after a fixed time period with conditions in place or by introducing error state timeouts that reset the value of `invalid_frame_count_`.
3. The actual response to increment beyond `1000` should be better regulated - perhaps adding more thresholds, applying varying recovery styles and handling network error to accommodate varied needs (e.g. handling normal increase patterns or network intensive conditions)

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
Http2Session* session = static_cast<Http2Session*>(user_data);

Debug(session, "invalid frame received, code: %d", lib_error_code);
if (session->invalid_frame_count_++ > 1000 &&
    !IsReverted(SECURITY_REVERT_CVE_2019_9514)) {
  return 1;
}

// If the error is fatal or if error code is ERR_STREAM_CLOSED... emit error
if (nghttp2_is_fatal(lib_error_code) ||
    lib_error_code == NGHTTP2_ERR_STREAM_CLOSED) {
```
