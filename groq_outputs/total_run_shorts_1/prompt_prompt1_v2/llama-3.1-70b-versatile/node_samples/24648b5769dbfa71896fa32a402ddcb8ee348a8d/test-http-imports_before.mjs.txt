VULNERABLE: YES

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Node.js is configured to allow unauthorized SSL/TLS connections by setting process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to '0'. This effectively disables the validation of SSL/TLS certificates, making the server vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the line `process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0';` directly disables the validation of SSL/TLS certificates for the Node.js server. By default, Node.js checks the validity of SSL/TLS certificates, including their issuer and expiration dates, before establishing a secure connection. However, by setting `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` to `'0'`, the server is configured to ignore any certificate errors and establish the connection regardless.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
It's strongly recommended to remove or replace the line that disables SSL/TLS validation with a more secure approach:
- Leave the default behavior (validation enabled) if possible.
- If certificate validation is not required (for example, in development or testing environments), consider using self-signed certificates with proper validation in place.
- If the server requires using a self-signed certificate, add the certificate to the trusted certificates list on the client side.
