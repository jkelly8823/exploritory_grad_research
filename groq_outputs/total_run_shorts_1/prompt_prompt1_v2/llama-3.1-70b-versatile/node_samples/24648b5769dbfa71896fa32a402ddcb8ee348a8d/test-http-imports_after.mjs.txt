VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identifiable vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
After carefully reviewing the provided code snippet, I was unable to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be test cases focused on the Node.js `import` function and how it handles different types of URLs. There are no apparent issues with regards to SQL injection, input validation, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other common web security vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None. The code snippet appears to be written with security in mind, considering it tests for restrictions on types of imports. Review of the larger system in which this code operates would be recommended for further identification of security concerns.
ORIGINAL CODE:
