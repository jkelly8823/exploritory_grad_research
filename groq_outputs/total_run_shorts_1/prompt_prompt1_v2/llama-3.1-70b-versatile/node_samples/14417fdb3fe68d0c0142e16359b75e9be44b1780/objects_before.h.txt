VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines an enumeration type `Flags` and several constants used for bit manipulation. After careful analysis, no security vulnerabilities were identified. The codes uses bitwise shifts and masks to perform operations, but these operations are not intended to handle user-supplied input or perform any sensitive operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
// FLAGS_MIN_VALUE and FLAGS_MAX_VALUE are specified to ensure that
// enumeration type has correct value range (see Issue 830 for more details).
enum Flags {
  FLAGS_MIN_VALUE = kMinInt,
  FLAGS_MAX_VALUE = kMaxInt
};

#define CODE_KIND_LIST(V) \
  V(FUNCTION)             \
  // Signed field cannot be encoded using the BitField class.
static const int kArgumentsCountShift = 14;
static const int kArgumentsCountMask = ~((1 << kArgumentsCountShift) - 1);

// This constant should be encodable in an ARM instruction.
static const int kFlagsNotUsedInLookup =
    TypeField::kMask | CacheHolderField::kMask;
```
