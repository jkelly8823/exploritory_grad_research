VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 8-11, 12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dangerous function overwrite and wildcard import
EXPLANATION:
In lines 8-11, the code overwrites the `process.binding` function with a new function that throws an `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` error. This is a potential vulnerability as it can lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Additionally, in line 12, the code uses a wildcard import (`const { has, deny } = require('internal/process/permission');`), which imports all properties from the `permission` module, making them available in the current scope. This can pose a security risk as it can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information or corruption of the application state.

Furthermore, while `getOptionValue` is not shown in the code snippet, its functionality can be critical to enabling or disabling this overwrite.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Instead of overwriting the `process.binding` function, consider creating a new function with a clear name and intent.

To mitigate the risks associated with wildcard imports, consider importing only the necessary functions and properties from the `permission` module.

Additionally, ensure that `getOptionValue` function has the necessary checks to validate user input and prevent unauthorized overwriting of `process.binding`.
