VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 22
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect ordering of memory deallocation.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a cleanup routine, where various resources are being freed. However, the order of deallocation seems to be incorrect. The `APP_HTTP_TLS_INFO *info` pointer is being accessed after its memory has been freed. Although the comment "cannot free info already here" is present, indicating awareness of this issue, the code does not take any steps to address it.

The line `OSSL_CMP_CTX_print_errors(cmp_ctx);` (line 14) has no effect on this vulnerability, nor does it change the analysis. 

However the actual trigger starts with NCONF_free, which is being freed while still being in use.
The deallocation of `conf` at the end of the snippet (line 22) is done without ensuring that the `opt_...` variables are no longer in use. This could cause unexpected behavior if these variables are used elsewhere in the code after the memory they point to has been deallocated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the memory deallocation is done in the correct order. The `NCONF_free` call should be done after all `opt_...` variables are no longer in use. Additionally, ensure that all pointers are set to `NULL` after freeing their memory to prevent accidental use-after-free.

ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
if ((info = OPENSSL_zalloc(sizeof(*info))) == NULL)
    goto err;
(void)OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_http_cb_arg(ctx, info);
info->server = opt_server;
info->port = server_port;
/* workaround for callback design flaw, see #17088: */
info->use_proxy = proxy_host != NULL;
if (ret != 1)
    OSSL_CMP_CTX_print_errors(cmp_ctx);

if (cmp_ctx != NULL) {
#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SOCK
    APP_HTTP_TLS_INFO *info = OSSL_CMP_CTX_get_http_cb_arg(cmp_ctx);

#endif
    ossl_cmp_mock_srv_free(OSSL_CMP_CTX_get_transfer_cb_arg(cmp_ctx));
    X509_STORE_free(OSSL_CMP_CTX_get_certConf_cb_arg(cmp_ctx));
    /* cannot free info already here, as it may be used indirectly by: */
    OSSL_CMP_CTX_free(cmp_ctx);
#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_SOCK
    APP_HTTP_TLS_INFO_free(info);
#endif
