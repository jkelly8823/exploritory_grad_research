VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code allows a possible infinite loop scenario. 
When `ret` is not `1`, but not `0` either, the `SSLfatal()` function is called. However, if `ret` is not handled properly in the `SSLfatal()` function, it could potentially allow an infinite loop to occur, leading to denial-of-service attacks. 
Moreover, in the case where `ret` is `0` (not fatal), the function still returns `1` if execution reaches that point, potentially hiding the occurrence of an error.

EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, when `tmpret` is not `1`, the function executes different branches depending on the value of `tmpret`. If `tmpret` is `0`, the function returns `2`, indicating a non-fatal issue. However, for other values of `tmpret`, the function calls `SSLfatal()`, which might not necessarily terminate the function execution. If `SSLfatal()` does not properly handle the error, it could lead to an infinite loop.
Additionally, if execution reaches the last line of the function `ret = 1;`, regardless of the previous error handling, the function may return `1`, masking the occurrence of an error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Add a return statement or a break in the `err` branch to ensure the function terminates after calling `SSLfatal()`.
* Use proper error handling in the `SSLfatal()` function to prevent infinite loops.
* When `ret` is not `1`, ensure the function consistently indicates an error, either by returning a different value or by bubbling up the error.
