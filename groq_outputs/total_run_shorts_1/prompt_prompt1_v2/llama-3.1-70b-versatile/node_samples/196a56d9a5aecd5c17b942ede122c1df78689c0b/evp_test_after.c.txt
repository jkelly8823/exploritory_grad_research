VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 77-81, 84-87
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Possible double-free error, use-after-free error, and memory leaks.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains several memory management issues. In lines 77-81 and 84-87, the `got` pointer is assigned to `OPENSSL_malloc` and then multiplied by 2 (`got_len *= 2`) at line 85 and 87. However, there is no corresponding multiplication or reallocation of the memory. This can lead to a use-after-free error, as the program may access memory that has been freed or reallocated.

Moreover, at line 81, `OPENSSL_malloc` is called and the result is checked for `NULL`. If `TEST_ptr(got)` fails, the code jumps to `err` and frees the memory with `t->err = "MALLOC_FAILURE";`. However, if `TEST_ptr(got)` succeeds, but `EVP_DigestSignFinal` or `EVP_DigestSign` fails, the memory allocated by `OPENSSL_malloc` is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. For lines 77-81 and 84-87, reallocate the memory to match the new `got_len` value using `OPENSSL_realloc`. Ensure that the reallocation is done correctly, considering the new size and the pointer's initial allocation.

2. Consider using smart pointers or memory management classes to avoid manual memory management.

3. After calling `EVP_DigestSignFinal` and `EVP_DigestSign`, check the results and free the memory allocated by `OPENSSL_malloc` to avoid memory leaks.
