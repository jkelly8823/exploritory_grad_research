VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent vulnerabilities detected. The code appears to be handling OpenSSL objects and checking for errors in a valid manner. The OBJ_new_nid and OBJ_add_object functions are being called with adequate error checking. The assignment of character pointers to tmpoid->sn and tmpoid->ln does not appear to be a cause for concern in this context.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
