VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded path in CFLAGS.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains a hardcoded path in the CFLAGS definition on line 5. The path '/dev/env/WATT_ROOT/inc' is directly referenced in the code. Hardcoding paths can lead to issues with portability and security. An attacker may be able to manipulate the environment variables to point to a different directory, potentially leading to code injection or sensitive information disclosure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use environment variables or configuration files to store path information instead of hardcoding it directly in the code. For example, you can define the 'WATT_ROOT' variable in a separate configuration file and then use it in the code:
```perl
my $watt_root = $ENV{'WATT_ROOT'};
...
cflags => "-I$watt_root/inc -DTERMIOS -DL_ENDIAN",
```
Alternatively, you can define the path as a separate variable and use it in the code snippet:
```perl
my $watt_root_inc = '/dev/env/WATT_ROOT/inc';
...
cflags => "-I$watt_root_inc -DTERMIOS -DL_ENDIAN",
```
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my %targets = (
    "DJGPP" => {
        inherit_from     => [ "BASE_unix" ],
        CC               => "gcc",
        CFLAGS           => "-fomit-frame-pointer -O2 -Wall",
        cflags           => "-I/dev/env/WATT_ROOT/inc -DTERMIOS -DL_ENDIAN",
        sys_id           => "MSDOS",
```
