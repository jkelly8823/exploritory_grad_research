VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The function X509_cmp_time and X509_cmp_current_time return 0 on error, which can potentially lead to issues in error handling. This is because 0 is also a valid return value for certain conditions (-1 for earlier or equal, 1 for later, and 0 for error).
EXPLANATION:
The code seems to follow a common pattern of using 0, -1, and 1 as return values to indicate different conditions. However, by using 0 for both an error condition and a valid comparison result, the function may cause confusion and issues in error handling. It would be better to use a distinct return value or an alternative method to report errors.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Consider changing the return value for error conditions to something distinct from valid comparison results. For example, X509_cmp_time and X509_cmp_current_time could return an error code that is less than -1 or greater than 1 to indicate an error.

Alternatively, consider using a different approach for error handling, such as using an output parameter or an exception to report errors. This would allow for more explicit and clear error reporting, reducing the potential for confusion and issues.
