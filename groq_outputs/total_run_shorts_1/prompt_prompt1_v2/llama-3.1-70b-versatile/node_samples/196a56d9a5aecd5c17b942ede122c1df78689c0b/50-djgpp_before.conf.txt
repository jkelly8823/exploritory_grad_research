VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
A potential security vulnerability exists due to an insecure hardcoded path. The variable `WATT_ROOT` is used to construct a path that is included in the compilation flags.

EXPLANATION:
The issue arises from line 5, where the hardcoded path `/dev/env/WATT_ROOT/inc` is used to include files in the compilation process. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker who has control over the `WATT_ROOT` environment variable or the directory structure.

Hardcoding paths like `/dev/env/` is also concerning, as this is not a typical or secure directory to store sensitive data or configuration.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following:

1. Use a secure and configurable method to set the include path, avoiding hardcoded sensitive information.
2. Validate and sanitize any user-input data that is used to construct the include path.
3. Use environment variables or secure configuration files to store sensitive information, and avoid using hardcoded paths.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
my %targets = (
    "DJGPP" => {
        CC               => "gcc",
        CFLAGS           => "-fomit-frame-pointer -O2 -Wall",
        cflags           => "-I/dev/env/WATT_ROOT/inc -DTERMIOS -DL_ENDIAN",
        sys_id           => "MSDOS",
```
