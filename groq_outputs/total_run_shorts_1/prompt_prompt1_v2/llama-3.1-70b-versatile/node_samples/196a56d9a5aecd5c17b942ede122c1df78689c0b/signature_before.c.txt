VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a small portion of an implementation related to OpenSSL, focusing on verifying an EVP signature and retrieving its number. The functions are well-structured and follow good coding practices. However, I would like to mention that there's an incomplete function (`evp_signature_get_number`) provided, which can lead to compilation warnings or errors, but it's not a security vulnerability.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are necessary, but I would like to suggest enabling compiler warnings for incomplete functions to catch similar issues.
