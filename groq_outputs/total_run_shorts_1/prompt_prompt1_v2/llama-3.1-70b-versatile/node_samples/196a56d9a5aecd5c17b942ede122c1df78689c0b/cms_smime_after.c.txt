VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a portion of a larger function that handles SMIME functionality, specifically dealing with copying data between BIOs and finalizing CMS data. The code properly handles error cases, raising exceptions when necessary, and correctly frees used resources.

A potential issue could be the use of `ERR_raise` and `goto err` for error handling. However, given the context of the code, this appears to be a standard and acceptable way of handling errors in OpenSSL. There are no apparent vulnerabilities, such as user input sanitization issues or potential buffer overflows, within the provided snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made based on the provided code snippet. It is always a good practice to ensure that error messages provide sufficient information without revealing sensitive details, but in this case, the error messages seem to be part of the OpenSSL library.

ORIGINAL CODE:

         * Don't use SMIME_TEXT for verify: it adds headers and we want to
         * remove them.
         */
        if (!SMIME_crlf_copy(dcont, cmsbio, flags & ~SMIME_TEXT))
            goto err;

        if (flags & CMS_TEXT) {
            if (!SMIME_text(tmpout, out)) {
                ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_CMS, CMS_R_SMIME_TEXT_ERROR);
        return 0;
    }

    if (!SMIME_crlf_copy(data, cmsbio, flags)) {
        goto err;
    }

    (void)BIO_flush(cmsbio);

    if (!CMS_dataFinal(cms, cmsbio)) {
        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_CMS, CMS_R_CMS_DATAFINAL_ERROR);
        goto err;
    }

    ret = 1;

err:
    do_free_upto(cmsbio, dcont);

    return ret;
