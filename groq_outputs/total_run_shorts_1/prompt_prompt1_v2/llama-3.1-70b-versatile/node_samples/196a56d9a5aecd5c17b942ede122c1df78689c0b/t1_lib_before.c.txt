VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 28-29 (EVP_DecryptUpdate, OPENSSL_free)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Potential Use-After-Free Vulnerability and Memory Leak.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses `sdec` pointer which is allocated using `OPENSSL_malloc`. However, the `OPENSSL_free` call that deals with the allocated memory is only executed when `sdec` is not null and the `EVP_DecryptUpdate` function returns an error. 

In the case where `EVP_DecryptUpdate` returns an error and `sdec` is null, the program does not deallocate the memory that was previously allocated to `sdec` prior to the failure, leading to a potential memory leak.

Moreover, prior to `sdec` being checked for null, `EVP_DecryptUpdate` may have written some data to `sdec` memory location, even though the allocation failed. 

However, it's worth noting that in this specific context, the code seems to assume that the allocation failure is a rare occurrence, and the subsequent checks will prevent the use-after-free in practice.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The check for allocation failure should be done before using `sdec`. 
2. In case of allocation failure, handle the error or propagate it. 
3. Always free the allocated memory when not in use to prevent memory leaks.
Here's how you could rewrite the part of the code:

    sdec = OPENSSL_malloc(eticklen);
    if (sdec == NULL) {
        // handle allocation error, propagate error, etc.
        return; // or some other way to exit the function
    }
    if (EVP_DecryptUpdate(ctx, sdec, &slen, p, (int)eticklen) <= 0) {
        // handle decryption error
        OPENSSL_free(sdec); // move this here to free only if allocation was successful
    }

ORIGINAL CODE:
    SSL_SESSION *sess = NULL;
    unsigned char *sdec;
    const unsigned char *p;
    int slen, renew_ticket = 0, declen;
    SSL_TICKET_STATUS ret = SSL_TICKET_FATAL_ERR_OTHER;
    size_t mlen;
    unsigned char tick_hmac[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
    SSL_HMAC *hctx = NULL;
    goto end;
}

/* Sanity check ticket length: must exceed keyname + IV + HMAC */
if (eticklen <=
    TLSEXT_KEYNAME_LENGTH + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(ctx) + mlen) {
    ret = SSL_TICKET_NO_DECRYPT;
    goto end;
}
eticklen -= mlen;
}
/* Attempt to decrypt session data */
/* Move p after IV to start of encrypted ticket, update length */
p = etick + TLSEXT_KEYNAME_LENGTH + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(ctx);
eticklen -= TLSEXT_KEYNAME_LENGTH + EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(ctx);
sdec = OPENSSL_malloc(eticklen);
if (sdec == NULL || EVP_DecryptUpdate(ctx, sdec, &slen, p,
    (int)eticklen) <= 0) {
    OPENSSL_free(sdec);
