VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a documentation file, likely written in POD (Plain Old Documentation) format, which is used to generate manual pages for OpenSSL. The code snippet does not contain any executable code or functions that can be exploited for vulnerabilities. The functions mentioned in the documentation are related to deprecated OpenSSL APIs, and their deprecation is explicitly mentioned.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet as it does not contain any executable code. However, it is essential to note that the code snippet mentions deprecated OpenSSL APIs, and their usage should be avoided in new code. Instead, the recommended replacement is the EVP_PKEY-DH(7) API.
ORIGINAL CODE:


#include <openssl/dh.h>

The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be
hidden entirely by defining B<OPENSSL_API_COMPAT> with a suitable version value,
see L<openssl_user_macros(7)>:

 DH* DH_new(void);

 void DH_free(DH *dh);


L<DH_new(3)>, L<ERR_get_error(3)>,
L<DH_generate_parameters(3)>,
L<DH_generate_key(3)>,
L<EVP_PKEY-DH(7)>

=head1 HISTORY

All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

For replacement see EVP_PKEY-DH(7).
