VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of a testing framework for cryptographic primitives. The functions `ivgen_test` and `setup_tests` do not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. The `ivgen_test` function uses two helper functions `do_encrypt` and `do_decrypt`, but without their implementation, it's impossible to assess their security. The `setup_tests` function adds tests to a test suite using a macro `ADD_TEST`.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
As this code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, no recommendations can be provided.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
return ret;
}

static int ivgen_test(void)
{
    unsigned char iv_gen[16];
    unsigned char tag[32];
    return do_encrypt(iv_gen, ct, &ctlen, tag, &taglen)
           && do_decrypt(iv_gen, ct, ctlen, tag, taglen);
}

int setup_tests(void)
{
    ADD_TEST(kat_test);
    ADD_TEST(badkeylen_test);
    ADD_TEST(ivgen_test);
    return 1;
}
```

Please note that without the implementation of `do_encrypt` and `do_decrypt` functions, it's impossible to assess the security of the code.
