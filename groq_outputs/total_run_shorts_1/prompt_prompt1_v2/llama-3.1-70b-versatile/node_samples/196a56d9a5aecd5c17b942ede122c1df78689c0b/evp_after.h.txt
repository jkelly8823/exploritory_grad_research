VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Use of EVP_CIPHER_CTX
EXPLANATION:
The function `cname##_ofb_cipher` appears to handle encryption operations with an `EVP_CIPHER_CTX` object. However, there is no validation or error handling for the parameters passed to this function. Potential vulnerabilities could include out-of-bounds access to sensitive data or allowing untrusted input to control sensitive operations.
Furthermore, the insecure use of the `EVP_CIPHER_CTX` object is due to the lack of error checking on the `ctx` parameter before passing it to internal cryptographic operations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement strict input validation for all parameters, including `ctx`, `out`, `in`, and `inl`, to prevent potential out-of-bounds access or other security issues.
- Verify the integrity of the `ctx` parameter to ensure an attacker cannot manipulate it to inject malicious data.
- Use exception handling or error codes to deal with potential errors that may arise from `EVP` operations.
- Use secure functions and error checking, for example referring to http://www.openssl.org/doxygen/crypto/EVP.html EVP documentation.
