No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerabilities were detected in the code snippet.

ORIGINAL CODE:
TYPE *lh_TYPE_insert(LHASH_OF(TYPE) *table, TYPE *data);
TYPE *lh_TYPE_delete(LHASH_OF(TYPE) *table, TYPE *data);
TYPE *lh_TYPE_retrieve(LHASH_OF(TYPE) *table, TYPE *data);

void lh_TYPE_doall(LHASH_OF(TYPE) *table, OPENSSL_LH_DOALL_FUNC func);
void lh_TYPE_doall_arg(LHASH_OF(TYPE) *table, OPENSSL_LH_DOALL_FUNCARG func,
                       TYPE *arg);
