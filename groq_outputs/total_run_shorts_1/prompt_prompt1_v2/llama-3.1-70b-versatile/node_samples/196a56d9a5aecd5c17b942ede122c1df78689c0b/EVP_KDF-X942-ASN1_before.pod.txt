VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet is a documentation text and does not contain any executable code. It appears to be a part of a perldoc documentation for OpenSSL's key derivation functions. There is no execution flow, no input handling, and no data processing, which makes it impossible to identify any vulnerabilities. The text provides explanations for some parameters used in the key derivation functions, but it does not contain any code that can be exploited.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None

ORIGINAL CODE:
(item "key" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_KEY>) <octet string>

The shared secret used for key derivation.  This parameter sets the secret.

=item "acvp-info" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_X942_ACVPINFO>) <octet string>
An optional octet string containing some additional, mutually-known public
information. Setting this value also sets "use-keybits" to 0.

=item "use-keybits" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_X942_SUPP_PRIVINFO>) <integer>

The default value of 1 will use the KEK key length (in bits) as the
"supp-pubinfo". A value of 0 disables setting the "supp-pubinfo".
