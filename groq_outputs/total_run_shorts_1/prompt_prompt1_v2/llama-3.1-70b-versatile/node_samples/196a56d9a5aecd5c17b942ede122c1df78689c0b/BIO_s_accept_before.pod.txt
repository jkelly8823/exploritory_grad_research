VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure error handling in error output.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet uses `ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr)`, which outputs error information to the standard error stream. However, it does not clear the OpenSSL error queue after printing the errors. This could potentially leak sensitive information, such as error messages, to unauthorized users. 

In addition, the `ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr)` function does not return any specific information regarding the error. It would be better to check for specific error codes to handle them differently, or at least clear the error queue to prevent further information leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to clear the error queue after printing the errors using `ERR_clear_error()` and use `ERR_get_error()` function to get the last error code and handle it separately.

ORIGINAL CODE:


BIO *abio, *cbio, *cbio2;

/* First call to BIO_accept() sets up accept BIO */
abio = BIO_new_accept("4444");
if (BIO_do_accept(abio) <= 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error setting up accept\n");
    ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
