VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Hardcoded secret value.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet stores a secret key (SharedSecret) in plaintext. Storing sensitive information, such as encryption keys or secrets, in plaintext is a significant security vulnerability. If this code is exposed to an unauthorized party, they could easily obtain the shared secret, potentially allowing them to decrypt sensitive information.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The shared secret value should be stored securely, such as in an environment variable, a secure key management system, or an encrypted configuration file. In addition, consider using a secure random number generator to generate the shared secret value instead of hardcoding it.
