VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is related to potential denial-of-service (DoS) due to unbounded iteration in the session cache pruning logic.

EXPLANATION:
The code enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as the session cache size exceeds the maximum allowed size. However, if the `remove_session_lock` function fails, the loop will continue indefinitely, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.

Additionally, the use of a while loop without a maximum number of iterations can lead to an excessive amount of iterations, resulting in resource exhaustion. This is a violation of the principle of "Fail Fast", which states that when a system is under attack, it should quickly report an error or terminate rather than trying to continue operating under the assumption that the attack might be successfully mitigated.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, a maximum number of iterations should be imposed on the while loop to prevent an infinite loop. This can be achieved by adding a counter to track the number of iterations and breaking out of the loop when the counter reaches a specified threshold.

Additionally, error handling should be added to handle the case where `remove_session_lock` fails. This could include logging an error or returning an error code to the caller.

```c
int max_iterations = 1000;
int iteration_count = 0;

while (SSL_CTX_sess_number(ctx) >= SSL_CTX_sess_get_cache_size(ctx)) {
    if (iteration_count >= max_iterations) {
        // log an error or return an error code
        break;
    }
    if (!remove_session_lock(ctx, ctx->session_cache_tail, 0))
        break;
    else
        ssl_tsan_counter(ctx, &ctx->stats.sess_cache_full);
    iteration_count++;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
c->time = time(NULL);
ssl_session_calculate_timeout(c);
}

if (s == NULL) {
    /*
     * new cache entry -- remove old ones if cache has become too large
     * delete cache entry *before* add, so we don't remove the one we're adding!
     */

    ret = 1;

    if (SSL_CTX_sess_get_cache_size(ctx) > 0) {
        while (SSL_CTX_sess_number(ctx) >= SSL_CTX_sess_get_cache_size(ctx)) {
            if (!remove_session_lock(ctx, ctx->session_cache_tail, 0))
                break;
            else
                ssl_tsan_counter(ctx, &ctx->stats.sess_cache_full);
        }
    }
}

SSL_SESSION_list_add(ctx, c);

if (s != NULL) {
    /*
     * existing cache entry -- decrement previously incremented reference
     * count because it already takes into account the cache
     */

    SSL_SESSION_free(s);    /* s == c */
    ret = 0;
}
CRYPTO_THREAD_unlock(ctx->lock);
return ret;
}
```
