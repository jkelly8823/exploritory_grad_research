VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 122-137
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
The modify_key_shares_filter subroutine modifies TLS messages and introduces insecure key_exchange data. 

EXPLANATION: 
The subroutine packs user-controlled data into key_exchange messages. This can be used by an attacker to perform key exchange attacks such as Bleichenbacher or Drown attacks.

The code introduces a hardcoded dummy key_share data that can be replaced by an attacker to launch an attack. It is also worth noting that there is no validation performed on the data that is being packed into the key_exchange messages. 

Lines 122-137 show that the code uses hardcoded dump key_share data and also accepts input data and packs it into the key_exchange messages without validation.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
Use secure and proven key_exchange algorithms and schema. Pack data from trusted sources and always validate user data.

Do not use hardcoded dumps for key_exchange data; instead, use cryptographically secure random data. Finally, validate data before packing it into key_exchange messages to prevent this vulnerability.
