VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a series of shell commands used for generating certificates and private keys using OpenSSL and a custom script (`mkcert.sh`). It does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as command injection, buffer overflows, or insecure data handling. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine if the `mkcert.sh` script or other external commands may introduce vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made based on this code snippet, as it appears to be secure. However, it is always a good idea to ensure that external commands and scripts are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

./mkcert.sh genroot "Cross Root" cross-key cross-root
