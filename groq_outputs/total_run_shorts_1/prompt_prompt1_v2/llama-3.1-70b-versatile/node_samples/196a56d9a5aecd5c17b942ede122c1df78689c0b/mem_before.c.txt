VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, I have not identified any obvious vulnerabilities. The functions CRYPTO_mem_debug_push and CRYPTO_mem_debug_pop do not appear to perform any operations that could lead to buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other security issues. 

The parameters in these functions and in CRYPTO_mem_debug_malloc are correctly declared and passed by value or by reference. There are no visible loop statements or conditional statements that might imply vulnerabilities like uncontrolled loops or undefined behaviors.

Additionally, since these functions are declared with specific purposes as hinted by their names and since these specific functions seem dead (return -1; always) I suppose it's really meant to perform specific tasks at other layers (wrapped in macros that don't show here).

Since the 'num', 'file', 'line', 'info', and 'flag' variables are not used in CRYPTO_mem_debug_push, some dead code might probably raise compiler warnings elsewhere, if the warnings for unused variables are turned on, but given the absence of complete declarations of the variables which is hinted in the prompt description, nothing can be thoroughly said. Given there's zero impact on the rest of the statements here. 

It's worth noting that there are void parameters too, those never do anything else to produce side effects by their very first 'appearance'.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
As the functions have appeared fully, and are of correct style, It's unnecessary in this context to give recommendations as we don't fully see how it handles potential corner-cases elsewhere or other usages of this source.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int CRYPTO_mem_debug_push(const char *info, const char *file, int line)
{
    (void)info; (void)file; (void)line;
    return -1;
}

int CRYPTO_mem_debug_pop(void)
{
    return -1;
}

void CRYPTO_mem_debug_malloc(void *addr, size_t num, int flag,
                             const char *file, int line)
```
