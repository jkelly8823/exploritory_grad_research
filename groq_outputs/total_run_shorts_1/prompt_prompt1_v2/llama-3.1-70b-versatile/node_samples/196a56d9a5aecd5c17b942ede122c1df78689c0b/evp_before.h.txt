VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
Upon analyzing the provided code snippet, I did not find any apparent vulnerabilities. The code defines a constant `EVP_MAXCHUNK` and declares a macro `BLOCK_CIPHER_func_ofb`. However, there is no code that handles user input, performs data processing, or has potential for memory corruption, information disclosure, or privilege escalation.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
        return 1;\
