VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-7
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a potential internal error that can lead to a denial of service attack. This occurs when the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl function call fails and sets the error, but the error code itself is not checked. This can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.
EXPLANATION:
The code calls ERR_raise to report an error when EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl fails. However, this does not prevent the function from continuing to execute, potentially in a compromised state. The goto err statement is also executed, which may escape some necessary cleanup actions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, the code should check the error code returned by EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl and ensure that the error is properly handled. Additionally, the code should consider implementing more robust error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior. For example, the code could return an error value from the function instead of using a goto statement.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
            if (EVP_CIPHER_CTX_is_encrypting(ctx)) {
                if (EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl(ctx, EVP_CTRL_AEAD_GET_TAG,
                    (int)mac_len, out+outlen) < 0) {
                        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_PKCS12, ERR_R_INTERNAL_ERROR);
                        goto err;
                    }
                    outlen += mac_len;
```
