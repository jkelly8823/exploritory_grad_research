VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Command Injection Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be vulnerable to a command injection attack due to the use of the `run` function with user-controlled input. Specifically, the `test(["ectest"])` argument is passed directly to the `run` function, which may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Although the input appears to be hardcoded, it is likely that this is a simplified example, and user-controlled input may be added later. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize any user-controlled input before passing it to the `run` function. Consider using a whitelisting approach to ensure that only allowed commands can be executed.

Additionally, consider using a more secure way to execute system commands, such as using `IPC::Run` or `Capture::Tiny` modules, which provide better control over the execution of system commands.

plan tests => 14;

require_ok(srctop_file('test','recipes','tconversion.pl'));

ok(run(test(["ectest"])), "running ectest");
                 -in => srctop_file("test", "tested448pub.pem"),
                 -args => ["pkey", "-pubin", "-pubout"] );
};```

Note: The last two lines of the code (`-in => srctop_file("test", "tested448pub.pem"), -args => ["pkey", "-pubin", "-pubout"] );`) appear to be related to the `run` function, but were not evaluated as part of the function call. However, they still pose a risk of command injection if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.
