VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate Key Exchange Group and Key Size

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet shows an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public key and a Diffie-Hellman group parameter. However, using Diffe-Hellman groups smaller than 512 bits is considered insecure. Specifically, the provided Diffie-Hellman group size is 2048 bits, but the recommended private key size is 224 bits, which is considered inadequate. The security community generally recommends using private key sizes of at least 256 bits for secure key exchange.

Additionally, the group 'ffdhe2048' is considered insecure by modern cryptographic standards and should be replaced by more secure alternatives.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Update the Diffie-Hellman group to a more secure option such as 'Curve25519' or ' Curve448'.
- Update the recommended private key size to at least 256 bits.
