VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of the OpenSSL library, specifically dealing with key exchange mechanisms. The functions `EVP_KEYEXCH_is_a` and `EVP_KEYEXCH_do_all_provided` seem to be implementing checks and iterating over provided key exchange mechanisms.

The `EVP_KEYEXCH_is_a` function checks if a given key exchange mechanism matches a specific name, using the `evp_is_a` function. This function does not seem to have any obvious security vulnerabilities, as it only checks for a matching name.

The `EVP_KEYEXCH_do_all_provided` function takes a function pointer `fn` and applies it to all provided key exchange mechanisms. While this could potentially be used to introduce vulnerabilities, there is no indication of this in the provided code snippet.

Overall, this code snippet does not appear to contain any obvious security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
int EVP_KEYEXCH_is_a(const EVP_KEYEXCH *keyexch, const char *name)
{
    return evp_is_a(keyexch->prov, keyexch->name_id, NULL, name);
}

void EVP_KEYEXCH_do_all_provided(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx,
                                 void (*fn)(EVP_KEYEXCH *keyexch, void *arg),
```
