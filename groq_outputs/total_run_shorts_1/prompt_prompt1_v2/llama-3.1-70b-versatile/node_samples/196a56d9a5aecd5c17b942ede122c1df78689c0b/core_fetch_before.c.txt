VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential double-free vulnerability in temporary store management.

EXPLANATION:
The function `ossl_method_construct_precondition` is responsible for storing and managing methods in either the global store or a temporary store. The function first checks if the method should be stored temporarily or not. If it should be stored temporarily, it retrieves a temporary store using `data->mcm->get_tmp_store` and then attempts to store the method in the temporary store. After storing the method in either the global or temporary store, the function then calls `data->mcm->destruct` to drop the reference to the method. 

However, if the method was stored in a temporary store, and if the call to `data->mcm->put` is successful but `data->mcm->destruct` fails (for example, due to an out-of-memory error), the method will be stored in the temporary store but its reference count will not be decremented. This could potentially lead to a double-free vulnerability when the method is eventually removed from the temporary store and its reference count is decremented again.

Additionally, the function stores the return value of `data->mcm->get_tmp_store` in the `data->store` variable. However, it does not check if the return value is NULL before storing the method in the temporary store. If `data->mcm->get_tmp_store` returns NULL, this will cause a null pointer dereference error when trying to store the method in the temporary store.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Check the return value of `data->mcm->put` before calling `data->mcm->destruct`. If `data->mcm->put` fails, do not call `data->mcm->destruct`.
2. Check the return value of `data->mcm->get_tmp_store` and handle the case where it returns NULL.
3. Consider adding additional error checking and handling for potential failures in the temporary store management code.
