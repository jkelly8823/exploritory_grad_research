VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 7-8
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability present in this code snippet is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the use of the `strcmp` function. This function does not perform any bounds checking on the input strings, and if a maliciously crafted string is passed to the `infile` variable, it could potentially cause a buffer overflow.

EXPLANATION:
The `strcmp` function compares two strings and returns the difference in their characters. However, it does not perform any bounds checking, which means it will continue to iterate over the strings until it finds the null-terminator. If a maliciously crafted string is passed to the `infile` variable, it could potentially overflow the buffer, causing a denial of service or potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a safer string comparison function that performs bounds checking, such as `strncmp` or `strcmp_safe`. Additionally, the `infile` variable should be validated before being used in the comparison to ensure it is not maliciously crafted. 

A safe way to compare strings in this context could be:
```c
if (infile == NULL || strncmp(infile, "-", 2) == 0) {
    inform = FORMAT_TEXT;
}
```
