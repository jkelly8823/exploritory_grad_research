VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 105-110
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The sscanf function in the fips_provider_version function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The sscanf function does not check the size of the destination buffer, and it will copy data into the buffer until it encounters a non-matching character or the end of the string. If the string is too long, it will overflow the buffer, causing undefined behavior.

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the sscanf function does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. In the fips_provider_version function, the sscanf function is used to parse the version string and extract the major, minor, and patch numbers. However, if the version string is too long, the sscanf function will overflow the vs buffer, causing undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend using the sscanf_s function instead of sscanf. The sscanf_s function checks the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it, preventing buffer overflows. Alternatively, we can use the sscanf function with a format specifier that includes the maximum field width, such as "%99d.%99d.%99d", to prevent buffer overflows.

Here is an example of the modified code using sscanf_s:

```c
if (sscanf_s(vs, "%d.%d.%d", &vers->major, &vers->minor, &vers->patch) != 3)
    goto err;
```

Alternatively, we can use the sscanf function with a format specifier that includes the maximum field width:

```c
if (sscanf(vs, "%99d.%99d.%99d", &vers->major, &vers->minor, &vers->patch) != 3)
    goto err;
```
