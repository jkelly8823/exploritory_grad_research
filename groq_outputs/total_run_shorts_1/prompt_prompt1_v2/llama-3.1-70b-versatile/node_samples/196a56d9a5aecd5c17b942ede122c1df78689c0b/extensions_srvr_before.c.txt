VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unintentional integer overflow in the calculation of the `agems` variable.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet introduces two time-related variables, `agesec` and `agems`, which are calculated from the current time and the timestamp associated with a session. However, the calculation of `agems` from `agesec` introduces a multiplication by 1000, which can cause an integer overflow if `agesec` is large. This overflow can lead to an incorrect value being stored in `agems`, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass valid session timeouts.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use a larger data type for the `agesec` and `agems` variables, such as `uint64_t` or a 64-bit integer.
2. Perform range checks on the `agesec` and `agems` values to prevent integer overflows.
3. Redesign the calculation to avoid using large multiplication factors that can lead to integer overflows.
