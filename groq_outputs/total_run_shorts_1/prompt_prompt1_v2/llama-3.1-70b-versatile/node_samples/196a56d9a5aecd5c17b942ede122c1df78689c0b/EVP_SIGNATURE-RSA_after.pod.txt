VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability was identified in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a documentation block describing the usage of certain parameters and their expected types. There are no actual code statements or expressions in the snippet that could potentially introduce a vulnerability. The descriptions provided seem to outline the expected parameters for a function or method, but without the actual code implementing this functionality, it's impossible to identify any potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A

ORIGINAL CODE:
Sets the name of the property query associated with the "mgf1-digest" algorithm.
NULL is used if this optional value is not set.

=item "saltlen" (B<OSSL_SIGNATURE_PARAM_PSS_SALTLEN>) <integer> or <UTF8 string>

The "pss" mode minimum salt length. The value can either be an integer,
a string value representing a number or one of the following string values:

=over 4

=item "digest" (B<OSSL_PKEY_RSA_PSS_SALT_LEN_DIGEST>)

=item "mgf1-digest" (B<OSSL_SIGNATURE_PARAM_MGF1_DIGEST>) <UTF8 string>

=item "saltlen" (B<OSSL_SIGNATURE_PARAM_PSS_SALTLEN>) <integer> or <UTF8 string>

These parameters are as described above.
