VULNERABLE_LINES: 10-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 The code contains a null pointer dereference vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The variable `thispkt` is checked for null in the first function, but not in the second function `mempacket_test_inject`. However, within the loop in the `mempacket_test_inject` function, the code attempts to access `thispkt->num` and `thispkt->type`. If `thispkt` becomes null at any point during the function execution, this would result in a null pointer dereference. 

Additionally, there seems to be an off-by-one error in the `mempacket_test_inject` function. The packet is inserted at index `i` if the current packet's number is greater than `thispkt->num`. This could result in packets being inserted at the wrong position if `thispkt->num` is not unique.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Add a null check for the `thispkt` variable before accessing its properties in the `mempacket_test_inject` function. This can be achieved with the following code:
```c
if (thispkt != NULL && thispkt->num != ctx->currpkt) {
}
```
It's also essential to ensure that `thispkt->num` is unique to avoid off-by-one errors when inserting packets into the ctx->pkts.
