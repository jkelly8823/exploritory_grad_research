VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Unvalidated Input in Command Execution

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet is vulnerable to unvalidated input in command execution. The `$nonfips_pub_key` and `$sigfile` variables are used as arguments in the `app(['openssl', 'dgst', ...])` function, which appears to be executing a system command. However, the code does not validate or sanitize the input values of these variables before passing them to the command. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input, potentially leading to command injection or file inclusion attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the input values of `$nonfips_pub_key` and `$sigfile` before passing them to the command. Here are a few recommended fixes:

1. Use `quotemeta` to escape any special characters in the input values:
```perl
$nonfips_pub_key = quotemeta($nonfips_pub_key);
$sigfile = quotemeta($sigfile);
```
2. Validate the input values against a whitelist of allowed characters. For example:
```perl
if ($nonfips_pub_key =~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/ && $sigfile =~ /^[a-zA-Z0-9_\.]+$/) {
    # continue with command execution
} else {
    # handle invalid input
}
```
3. Consider using a safer way to execute system commands, such as using ` Capturex` or ` IPC::Run` modules.
