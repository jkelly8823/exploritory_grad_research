VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of BN_clear_free with a potentially NULL pointer

EXPLANATION:
In the given code snippet, the function BN_clear_free is being called on the variable bn_priv without checking if it has been initialized or is currently NULL. Although the variable is declared as NULL initially, it's possible that in the full code (not shown in this snippet) the variable may not be properly set before calling BN_clear_free.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Before calling BN_clear_free on the variable bn_priv, it should be checked for NULL. If it is NULL, then the function call should be avoided. Here's how you could implement this check:
```c
if(bn_priv != NULL){
    BN_clear_free(bn_priv);
    bn_priv = NULL;
}
```
This check ensures that BN_clear_free is only called if the variable is not NULL. 

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <openssl/evp.h>

char *curve_name[64];
unsigned char pub[256];
BIGNUM *bn_priv = NULL;

/*
    /* Error */
}


BN_clear_free(bn_priv);
