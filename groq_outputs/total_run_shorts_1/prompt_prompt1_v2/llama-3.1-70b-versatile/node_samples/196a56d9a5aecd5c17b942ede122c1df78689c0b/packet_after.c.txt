VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Unchecked pointer dereference and incorrect function usage
EXPLANATION:
The function `WPACKET_put_bytes__` has two potential vulnerabilities:

1. The `WPACKET_allocate_bytes` function returns an unsigned char pointer that is not checked for NULL before its dereference in the `put_value` function. If the memory allocation fails, this will result in a null pointer dereference.

2. The function `put_value` seems to be incorrectly using `WPACKET_start_sub_packet_len__` without passing it the allocated `data` and the calculated length. It's also passing 0 as the length, which might be incorrect. This may lead to incorrect data being stored in the packet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the vulnerabilities:

1. Check the return value of `WPACKET_allocate_bytes` and ensure that `data` is not NULL before passing it to `put_value`.

2. Modify the `put_value` function to correctly store the value at the allocated memory location, and then use the stored `data` with its calculated length in the `WPACKET_start_sub_packet_len__` function.

Here's an updated version of the code that addresses these vulnerabilities:

```c
int WPACKET_put_bytes__(WPACKET *pkt, uint64_t val, size_t size)
{
    unsigned char *data;

    if (!ossl_assert(size <= sizeof(uint64_t))
            || !WPACKET_allocate_bytes(pkt, size, &data))
        return 0;
    
    if(data == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    if(!put_value(data, val, size)) {
        return 0;
    }

    return WPACKET_start_sub_packet_len__(pkt, size);
}

static int put_value(unsigned char *data, uint64_t value, size_t len)
{
    memmove(data, &value, len);
    return 1;
}
```
