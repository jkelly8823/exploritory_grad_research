ORIGINAL CODE:
=head1 NAME

EVP_PBE_CipherInit, EVP_PBE_CipherInit_ex,
EVP_PBE_find, EVP_PBE_find_ex - Password based encryption routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>
 int EVP_PBE_find_ex(int type, int pbe_nid, int *pcnid, int *pmnid,
                     EVP_PBE_KEYGEN **pkeygen, EVP_PBE_KEYGEN_EX **keygen_ex);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 PBE operations

If a NULL is supplied for any of I<pcnid>, I<pmnid>, I<pkeygen> or I<pkeygen_ex>
then this parameter is not returned.

=head1 NOTES

The arguments I<pbe_obj> and I<param> to EVP_PBE_CipherInit() and EVP_PBE_CipherInit_ex()
together form an B<X509_ALGOR> and can often be extracted directly from this structure.
