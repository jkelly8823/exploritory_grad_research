VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No security vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION: 
This code snippet appears to be a documentation excerpt, specifically a help or man page for a command-line interface. It provides information about the -xoflen option for OpenSSL providers. There are no executable code or potential vulnerabilities within this snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No security recommendations are necessary as this code snippet is not vulnerable to any security issues.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
=item B<-xoflen> I<length>

Set the output length for XOF algorithms, such as B<shake128> and B<shake256>.
This option is not supported for signing operations.

For OpenSSL providers it is recommended to set this value for shake algorithms,
since the default values are set to only supply half of the maximum security
strength.

For backwards compatibility reasons the default xoflen length for B<shake128> is
16 (bytes) which results in a security strength of only 64 bits. To ensure the
maximum security strength of 128 bits, the xoflen should be set to at least 32.

For backwards compatibility reasons the default xoflen length for B<shake256> is
32 (bytes) which results in a security strength of only 128 bits. To ensure the
maximum security strength of 256 bits, the xoflen should be set to at least 64.
