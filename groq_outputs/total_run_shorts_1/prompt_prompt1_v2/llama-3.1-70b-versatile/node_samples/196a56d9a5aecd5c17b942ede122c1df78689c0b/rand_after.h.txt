VULNERABLE: NO

VULNERABLE_LINES: None

VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet does not contain any executable code that could introduce a vulnerability. It consists of function declarations only. These functions seem to be related to random number generation and entropy, but without their implementation details, we cannot assess potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are applicable, as this code snippet appears to be function declarations rather than executable code.
