VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 15-16
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of unchecked dynamic memory allocation.

EXPLANATION:
In lines 15-16 of the provided code snippet, `OSSL_LIB_CTX_new()` and `OSSL_PROVIDER_load(keyctx, "default")` are used to allocate memory dynamically. However, there is no validation or error checking to ensure that these allocations were successful if they fail silently, a malicious attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code or launch a denial of service attack. Moreover, no validation or error checking is performed to ensure that the allocated memory is being properly freed to prevent memory leaks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and check the return values of `OSSL_LIB_CTX_new()` and `OSSL_PROVIDER_load(keyctx, "default")`. If the allocations fail, then the application should terminate or throw an exception to prevent undefined behavior.
2. Implement memory leak prevention measures to ensure that dynamically allocated memory is being properly freed.
3. Consider using smart pointers to manage memory allocation and deallocation.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
static int default_libctx = 1;
static int is_fips = 0;
static int is_fips_3_0_0 = 0;

static OSSL_LIB_CTX *testctx = NULL;
static OSSL_LIB_CTX *keyctx = NULL;
static char *testpropq = NULL;
                             output_type, output_structure, pass, pcipher)))
        goto end;

        if (TEST_false(decode_cb(file, line, (void **)&pkey2, encoded,
                                  encoded_len, output_type, output_structure,
                                  (flags & FLAG_DECODE_WITH_TYPE ? type : NULL),
                                  selection, pass)))
            return 0;
    }

    /* FIPS(3.0.0): provider imports explicit params but they won't work #17998 */
    is_fips_3_0_0 = fips_provider_version_eq(testctx, 3, 0, 0);
    if (is_fips_3_0_0 < 0)
        return 0;

    /* Separate provider/ctx for generating the test data */
    if (!TEST_ptr(keyctx = OSSL_LIB_CTX_new()))
        return 0;
    if (!TEST_ptr(keyprov = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(keyctx, "default"))
