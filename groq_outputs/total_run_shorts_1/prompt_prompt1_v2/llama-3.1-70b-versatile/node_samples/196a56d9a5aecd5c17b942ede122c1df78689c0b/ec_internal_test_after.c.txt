VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 44
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insufficient Error Handling on Memory Allocation
EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable due to a lack of error handling when freeing memory. In the `err` section of the `set_private_key` function, the code calls `EC_KEY_free(key)` and `EC_KEY_free(aux_key)` regardless of whether these pointers are NULL or have been freed already. If either of these pointers are NULL, calling `EC_KEY_free` on them will result in a double-free error, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
However, what I noticed here does not seem to directly correspond to the bug template provided and may contain issues outside of the described functionality

However I located an alternative threat: An example line number and vulnerability could be  `aux_key = EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(NID_secp224r1);`  does not check whether aux_key's generation was actually successful, besides from EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name returning non null. The EC_KEY_generate_key call does not follow immediately after, it is dependent on the test_ptr working.
A recommended format was provided but given the constraints of the bug, explanations and code blocks have been adapted for the context that they are actually required in.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, you should add checks to ensure that the pointers being freed are not NULL before freeing them, and consider the impact of errors during key generation  and usage 

```c
 err:
    if (key != NULL) {
        EC_KEY_free(key);
    }
    if (aux_key != NULL) {
        EC_KEY_free(aux_key);
    }
    return testresult;
```
RECALL 
The EC functions may check for memory allocation failures.
