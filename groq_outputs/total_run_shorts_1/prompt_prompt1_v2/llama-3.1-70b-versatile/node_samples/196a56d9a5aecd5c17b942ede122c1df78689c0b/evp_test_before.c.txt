VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 19-20, 53-54
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure memory allocation and potential memory leak
EXPLANATION:
In the provided code, there are two instances of memory allocation using `OPENSSL_malloc` which can potentially lead to a memory leak if the allocated memory is not freed properly in all cases. At lines 19-20, memory is allocated but not checked for NULL before it is freed. At lines 53-54, memory is allocated but not checked for NULL before it is used. 

Moreover, memory allocation with large sizes (like `got_len` being `expected->output_len * 2`) can also lead to memory exhaustion attacks. Additionally, there are several missing checks for NULL before accessing or freeing the allocated memory.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should:
- Always check the return value of `OPENSSL_malloc` for NULL before using the allocated memory.
- Free the allocated memory as soon as it is no longer needed, especially in error cases.
- Avoid using arbitrary large memory allocation sizes that can lead to memory exhaustion attacks.

Here's how you can do it:
```c
unsigned char *got = NULL;
got = OPENSSL_malloc(got_len == 0 ? 1 : got_len);
if (!got) {
    // Handle memory allocation failure
    t->err = "MALLOC_FAILURE";
    goto err;
}
```
