VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inconsistent Comparison and Potential Uninitialized Variable in Logic
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains an inconsistent comparison in the `modify_key_shares_filter` subroutine. The code tries to access and modify the `$message` and `$direction` variables. However, the `$message` variable is not defined within the function's scope. Moreover, the `$direction` variable is not being passed as a parameter to the function or even defined within its scope.

Additionally, the code is using an undefined variable `$testtype` in multiple conditions without being defined anywhere within its scope. Its value remains unknown, which may cause the program to behave uncertainly.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Pass the required variables as function parameters. 

In this case, include the following lines at the beginning of your subroutine definition:

```perl
my ($proxy, $message, $direction, $testtype) = @_;
```

Additionally, define the `$testtype` variable and pass it when calling the subroutine.

Always initialize variables within their scope to be used within the functions.
