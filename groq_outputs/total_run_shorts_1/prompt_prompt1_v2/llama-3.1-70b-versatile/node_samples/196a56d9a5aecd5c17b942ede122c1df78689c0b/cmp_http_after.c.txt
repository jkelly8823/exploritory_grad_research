VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identified vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a part of the OpenSSL project. It defines a function `keep_alive` that takes two `int` parameters: `keep_alive` and `body_type`. The function uses if statements to evaluate the `keep_alive` and `body_type` variables and their combinations. 
The code provided does not contain any direct inputs (e.g., from network or user), so it does not seem to be directly vulnerable to typical security risks such as injection attacks, data leakage from memory buffers, etc. At the same time, without knowing specific context and wider functionality it's difficult to analyze deeper. 
Even without more information about input values and function purpose, there are no visible buffer overflow errors, insecure function calls, insecure cryptographic functions or other common errors according to OWASP Secure Coding Practices. 
In order to have better understanding of the code in question, one would need more of the underlying codebase to perform deeper static analysis.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Provide a return value or throw an exception to indicate the outcome of the `keep_alive` function.
Consider validating all user input (to the extent applicable here) or function inputs if any before operating on it.
Verify other routines included in a program. Check for all indirect and direct inputs.
Original Code being more part might aid further understanding or determination on it.
