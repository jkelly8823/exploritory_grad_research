VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Inadequate Handling of EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() Error Code

EXPLANATION:
The code calls EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() and checks for a negative return value. However, the returned length is also checked against the value 1 and if it's less than or equal to 1, the length is set to 0. This indicates a potential issue with handling IV lengths in an insecure way.

In particular, some ciphers may have a valid IV length of 1 or less (for example, ChaCha20 uses a 0-byte IV for the stream cipher), and setting the IV length to 0 in these cases may result in insecure or incorrect behavior.

Furthermore, this code does not actually handle GCM mode explicitly, despite the comment. It only checks if the mode is CBC and sets the IV length to 0 if it is short. For GCM mode, explicit part of IV is needed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
When dealing with IV lengths, you should follow these recommendations:

- Ensure that you handle all return codes from EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length() in an expected way.
- Validate the IV length against the specifications of the used cipher.
- Handle short IV lengths securely, and consider explicit checks for specific ciphers like GCM.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
int mode = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_mode(s->enc_write_ctx);
if (mode == EVP_CIPH_CBC_MODE) {
    eivlen = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_iv_length(s->enc_write_ctx);
    if (eivlen < 0) {
        SSLfatal(s, SSL_AD_INTERNAL_ERROR, SSL_R_LIBRARY_BUG);
        return -1;
    }
    if (eivlen <= 1)
        eivlen = 0;
}
/* Need explicit part of IV for GCM mode */
```
