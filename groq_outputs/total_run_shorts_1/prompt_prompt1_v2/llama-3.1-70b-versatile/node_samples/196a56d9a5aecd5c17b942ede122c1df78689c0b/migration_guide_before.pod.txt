VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (code is being deprecated and recommending alternative use, however referenced methods contain vulnerabilities)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code snippet references `BN_is_prime_ex` and `BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex` which are being deprecated in favor of `BN_check_prime(3)`. However, this does not mean the snippet itself is vulnerable, rather the functions which the snippet references.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not actually demonstrate usage of the `BN_is_prime_ex` and `BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex` functions. However, these functions are being deprecated in favor of `BN_check_prime(3)` because they "avoids possible misuse and always uses at least 64 rounds of the Miller-Rabin primality test." This implies that if `BN_is_prime_ex` and `BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex` are not used properly, they can be vulnerable to primality test attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use `BN_check_prime(3)` instead of `BN_is_prime_ex` and `BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex` to avoid potential primality test attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
BN_is_prime_ex(), BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex()

Use L<BN_check_prime(3)> which that avoids possible misuse and always uses at least
64 rounds of the Miller-Rabin primality test.
