VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet consists of four function declarations for handling random number generation and cleanup. There are no apparent vulnerabilities in the given code, such as buffer overflows, unvalidated user input, or insecure use of functions.

The functions appear to be designed to handle sensitive operations like generating random numbers and cleaning up seed material, but there is no indication of how these functions are implemented or how the provided parameters are used. Without more information about the implementation, it's difficult to pinpoint any potential vulnerabilities.

Given the snippet's focus on function declarations and lack of concrete implementation, it's unlikely to introduce significant security risks on its own.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made without more information about the implementation of these functions.
