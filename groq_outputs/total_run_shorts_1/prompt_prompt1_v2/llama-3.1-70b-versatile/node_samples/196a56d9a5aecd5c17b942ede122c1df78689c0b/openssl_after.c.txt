VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use After Free vulnerability in BIO_free and BIO_free_all calls.

EXPLANATION:
The code calls BIO_free_all(bio_in) then immediately calls BIO_free_all(bio_out) and later calls BIO_free_all(bio_err). In the given code snippet, we have to consider the case in which bio_in equals bio_out, which would result in bio_out being freed twice - first as bio_in and then as its original value - since BIO_free_all is used recursively and tries to free the whole 'BIO' chain.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Call BIO_free(bio) instead of BIO_free_all(bio) if bio_in or bio_out only refer to a chain of one 'BIO'. Also call BIO_free all on each separately in the case the result of these will always refer to the first item in a chain or to NULL, avoiding the double-free problem:

```c
BIO_free_all(bio_in);
bio_out = bio_in = NULL; // Reset after freeing the chain to prevent other calls
```
or 
```c
bio_in = bio_out = NULL;
BIO_free_all(bio_err);
```
However, because our analysis is so incomplete given we do not have information for bio_in and bio_err, you should ensure that the bio_out is pointed to different chain from bio_in when we decide to free bio_in.
