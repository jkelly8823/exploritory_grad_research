VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of an operating system-specific function that defines the behavior of `ossl_sleep()` for Unix systems. It includes a header file (`<unistd.h>`) and starts defining a static inline function `ossl_sleep()` that takes an `unsigned long` parameter `millis`. However, the snippet is incomplete due to the GitHub commit context, and there are no apparent security vulnerabilities present in the provided lines of code.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, no recommendations are necessary.
ORIGINAL CODE:
