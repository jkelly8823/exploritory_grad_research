VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 2, 3
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet uses the DES EDE3 ECB encryption algorithm with a hardcoded key.
EXPLANATION:
The use of the DES EDE3 ECB algorithm is insecure due to its vulnerability to brute force attacks. DES EDE3 ECB is an outdated encryption algorithm and has been replaced by more secure alternatives such as AES. Furthermore, the key is hardcoded in the code, which makes it vulnerable to exposure if the code is accessed by unauthorized parties. In addition, the ECB mode of DES EDE3 is not recommended for encrypting large amounts of data because it can reveal patterns in the data due to its lack of diffusion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended to use a more secure encryption algorithm such as AES, in a secure mode like GCM or CBC, with a securely generated and stored key. Key hardcoding should be avoided, and instead, consider using secure key management practices like key derivation or secure storage.
