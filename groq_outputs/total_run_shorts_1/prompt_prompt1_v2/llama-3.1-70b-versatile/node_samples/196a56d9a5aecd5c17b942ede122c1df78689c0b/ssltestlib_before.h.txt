VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION: This code snippet defines two constants (`MEMPACKET_CTRL_GET_DROP_REC` and `MEMPACKET_CTRL_SET_DUPLICATE_REC`) and a function prototype (`mempacket_test_inject`) along with a struct typedef (`MEMPACKET`). There is no apparent evidence of a vulnerability in this code snippet. The constants and function prototype do not seem to be doing anything inherently insecure, and the struct typedef is innocuous.
RECOMMENDATIONS: N/A
