VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a series of tests written in Perl, using the Test2 framework. The tests cover various scenarios related to OpenSSL commands. 

After careful analysis, I could not identify any vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet. All external commands are properly passed in a list of strings using the `app` function, which should prevent command injection vulnerabilities. The tests also properly use regular expressions to validate the output of these commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```perl
setup("test_dgst");

plan tests => 12;

sub tsignverify {
    my $testtext = shift;
    my $privkey = shift;
    ok($xofdata[1] =~ $expected,
       "XOF: Check second digest value is consistent with the first ($xofdata[1]) vs ($expected)");
};

subtest "SHAKE digest generation with no xoflen set `dgst` CLI" => sub {
    plan tests => 1;

    my $testdata = srctop_file('test', 'data.bin');
    my @xofdata = run(app(['openssl', 'dgst', '-shake128', $testdata], stderr => "outerr.txt"), capture => 1);
    chomp(@xofdata);
    my $expected = qr/SHAKE-128\(\Q$testdata\E\)= bb565dac72640109e1c926ef441d3fa6/;
    ok($xofdata[0] =~ $expected, "Check short digest is output");
};

SKIP: {
    skip "ECDSA is not supported by this OpenSSL build", 1
        if disabled("ec");
