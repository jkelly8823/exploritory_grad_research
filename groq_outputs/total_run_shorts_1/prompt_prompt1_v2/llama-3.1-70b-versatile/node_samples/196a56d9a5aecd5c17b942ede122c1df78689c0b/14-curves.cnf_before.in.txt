VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No identifiable vulnerabilities
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a portion of a Perl program that is constructing test cases. It iterates over a list of curves and generates test cases based on those curves. The code does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities, such as injection vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, or unauthorized data access. However, without more context, it's difficult to confirm the security of the code.

It's worth noting that the TLS 1.3 protocol is more secure than TLS 1.2, but without more information on how the curves are used, it's impossible to assess the overall security of the code.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
            },
        };
    }
    foreach (0..$#curves_tls_1_2) {
        my $curve = $curves_tls_1_2[$_];
        push @tests, {
            name => "curve-${curve}-tls13",
