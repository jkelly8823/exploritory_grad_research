VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No apparent vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
Upon examining the provided code snippet, I did not find any apparent vulnerabilities. The code snippet appears to be securely allocating an EVP_PKEY_CTX using EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id, which is a standard function in OpenSSL for creating a new public key context.

However, I must note that the code snippet is quite short and doesn't reveal much about how the buffer lengths are being handled or how the output is being validated. Without more context or additional code, I couldn't find any vulnerabilities in this specific snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed in this case, as I couldn't find any vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
 EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_HKDF, NULL);

The total length of the info buffer cannot exceed 2048 bytes in length: this
should be more than enough for any normal use of HKDF.

The output length of an HKDF expand operation is specified via the length
parameter to the L<EVP_PKEY_derive(3)> function.
