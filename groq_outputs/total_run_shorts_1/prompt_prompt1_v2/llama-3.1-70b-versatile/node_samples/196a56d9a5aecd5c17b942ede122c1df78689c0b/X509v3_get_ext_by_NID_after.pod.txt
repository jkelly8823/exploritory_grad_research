No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are needed as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
The provided code snippet includes functions declarations and a description of what the functions do, however, this is just the documentation. The actual code snippet for these functions is not provided and cannot be analyzed directly. Below is the provided code.

```
int X509_CRL_get_ext_count(const X509_CRL *x);
X509_EXTENSION *X509_CRL_get_ext(const X509_CRL *x, int loc);
int X509_CRL_get_ext_by_NID(const X509_CRL *x, int nid, int lastpos);
int X509_CRL_get_ext_by_OBJ(const X509_CRL *x, const ASN1_OBJECT *obj,
                             int lastpos);
int X509_CRL_get_ext_by_critical(const X509_CRL *x, int crit, int lastpos);
X509_EXTENSION *X509_CRL_delete_ext(X509_CRL *x, int loc);
int X509_CRL_add_ext(X509_CRL *x, X509_EXTENSION *ex, int loc);
