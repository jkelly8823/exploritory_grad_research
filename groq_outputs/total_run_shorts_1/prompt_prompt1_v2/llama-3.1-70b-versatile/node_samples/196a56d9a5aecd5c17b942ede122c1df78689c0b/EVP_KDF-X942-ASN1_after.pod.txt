VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After analyzing the code snippet, I did not find any indications of vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflow, or insecure data handling. This code appears to be a documentation snippet that describes the parameters for a key derivation function using OpenSSL's EVP_KDF. The parameters seem to be properly defined and do not contain any user-input or suspicious data.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as it does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities.
ORIGINAL CODE:


These parameters work as described in L<EVP_KDF(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=item "secret" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_SECRET>) <octet string>

The shared secret used for key derivation.  This parameter sets the secret.

=item "acvp-info" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_X942_ACVPINFO>) <octet string>
An optional octet string containing some additional, mutually-known public
information. Setting this value also sets "use-keybits" to 0.

=item "use-keybits" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_X942_USE_KEYBITS>) <integer>

The default value of 1 will use the KEK key length (in bits) as the
"supp-pubinfo". A value of 0 disables setting the "supp-pubinfo".
