VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Null pointer dereferences
EXPLANATION:
In the code snippet, there are several instances where a null pointer is checked after a function call. This is a potential vulnerability as it can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly if the null pointer is dereferenced.

In X509_REQ_delete_attr function, the code checks if `req` is null before using it. However, in the same scope, `X509at_delete_attr` is called before `req` is checked for null. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference if `X509at_delete_attr` tries to access a member of `req` before the null check.

Similarly, in X509_REQ_add1_attr, X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_OBJ, X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_NID, and X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_txt functions, the code checks if `req` is null after calling functions with `req` as a parameter. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference if the called function tries to access a member of `req` before the null check.

The function X509_REQ_get_attr_by_NID could also result in an out of bounds array access if the ext_nids array isn't null-terminated or its null-terminator isn't located in the array, as its terminating condition is specified with an address and offset ("for (pnid = ext_nids; *pnid != NID_undef; pnid++)")

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the null check should be performed before calling any functions that use the potentially null pointer.

In X509_REQ_delete_attr, move the null check before the call to `X509at_delete_attr`.

```c
X509_ATTRIBUTE *X509_REQ_delete_attr(X509_REQ *req, int loc)
{
    X509_ATTRIBUTE *attr;
    if (req == NULL) {
        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_X509, ERR_R_PASSED_NULL_PARAMETER);
        return 0;
    }
    if (req->req_info.attributes == NULL) {
        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_X509, ERR_R_PASSED_NULL_PARAMETER);
        return 0;
    }
    attr = X509at_delete_attr(req->req_info.attributes, loc);
    if (attr != NULL)
        req->req_info.enc.modified = 1;
    return attr;
}
```
Similarly, move the null check before the call to other functions in X509_REQ_add1_attr, X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_OBJ, X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_NID, and X509_REQ_add1_attr_by_txt.

```c
int X509_REQ_add1_attr(X509_REQ *req, X509_ATTRIBUTE *attr)
{
    if (req == NULL) {
        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_X509, ERR_R_PASSED_NULL_PARAMETER);
        return 0;
    }
    if (req->req_info.attributes == NULL) {
        ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_X509, ERR_R_PASSED_NULL_PARAMETER);
        return 0;
    }
    if (!X509at_add1_attr(&req->req_info.attributes, attr))
        return 0;
    req->req_info.enc.modified = 1;
    return 1;
}
```

Add a loop termination check for X509_REQ_get_attr_by_NID extenstion lookup, as this is a common place for bounds issues in the initial review.

```c
for (i = 0; ext_nids[i] != -1; i++) {
    nid = ext_nids[i];
    if (req_nid == nid){
        return nid;
    }
    if (nid == NID_undef)
        return 0;
```
