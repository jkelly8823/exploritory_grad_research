VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No specific vulnerability detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be an enum or options list for cryptographic-related commands. The code snippet is properly formatted and doesn't have any obvious security vulnerabilities. Since we don't have the full code context, it's difficult to identify potential vulnerabilities, but the presented code doesn't raise any major security concerns.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code snippet. However, to maintain secure coding practices, consider using a secure method to handle user input and validate the options and parameters passed to this enum. Additionally, keep the cryptographic algorithms up to date with the latest security standards and guidelines.
