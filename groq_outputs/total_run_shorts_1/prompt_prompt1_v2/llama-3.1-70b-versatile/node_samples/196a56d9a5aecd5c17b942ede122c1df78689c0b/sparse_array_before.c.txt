VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet contains two function definitions for `ossl_sa_free` and `ossl_sa_free_leaves`. However, upon analysis, no potential vulnerabilities were identified within these functions. The code snippet appears to be part of a memory management routine for `OPENSSL_SA` objects. The functions operate on the input `OPENSSL_SA *sa` pointer and perform memory deallocation operations using `sa_doall` and `OPENSSL_free`. No error handling weaknesses, data type mismatches, or potential buffer overflows were detected within the provided snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
void ossl_sa_free(OPENSSL_SA *sa)
{
    sa_doall(sa, &sa_free_node, NULL, NULL);
    OPENSSL_free(sa);
}

void ossl_sa_free_leaves(OPENSSL_SA *sa)
{
    // (Function body incomplete or truncated)
}
