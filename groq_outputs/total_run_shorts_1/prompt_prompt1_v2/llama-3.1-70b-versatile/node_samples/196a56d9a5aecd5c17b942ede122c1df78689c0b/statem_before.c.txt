VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5-6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a double-free memory corruption due to the use of `WPACKET_cleanup` on a packet that has been previously freed by `WPACKET_finish`.

EXPLANATION:
The `WPACKET_finish` function is called on the packet `pkt` regardless of the return value of `ssl_close_construct_packet`, which means that `WPACKET_finish` may or may not allocate memory for the packet. If `WPACKET_finish` does allocate memory, it is then freed by `WPACKET_finish`, as it returns a pointer to the allocated packet. However, if `ssl_close_construct_packet` fails (returns 0), the `WPACKET_cleanup` function is still called on the packet `pkt`. In this case, `WPACKET_cleanup` may still attempt to free the packet's memory even though it has already been freed by `WPACKET_finish`, resulting in a double-free error.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, we recommend avoiding the use of `WPACKET_cleanup` on a packet that has been previously freed by `WPACKET_finish`. Instead, use a flag or indicator to track whether the packet has been finished and freed, and only call `WPACKET_cleanup` if the packet has not been finished.

Here is a possible fix:

```c
if (!ssl_close_construct_packet(s, &pkt, mt) || !WPACKET_finish(&pkt)) {
    // Set a flag to indicate that the packet has not been successfully finished
    bool finished = false;
    if (WPACKET_finish(&pkt)) {
        finished = true;
    }
    if (!finished) {
        WPACKET_cleanup(&pkt);
    }
}
```
