VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to contain a series of enumeration values and preprocessor definitions for TLS extension indices and labels. These values are static and do not pose a risk to the security of the program. There are no memory read or write operations, pointer arithmetic, or data modification that could lead to a vulnerability. The lack of dynamic input, data manipulation, or execution of commands that could lead to security risks makes this code snippet free of vulnerabilities within the context of the provided snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None required.
