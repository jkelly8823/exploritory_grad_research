VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities were found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not appear to be vulnerable to common security threats such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. It consists of a series of define directives for TLS extension indices and cryptographic labels. No executable code paths or direct user input is evident in this snippet, thus the likelihood of finding vulnerabilities is extremely low. Furthermore, there are no suspicious method calls or string operations that could be leveraged for malicious purposes. Overall, this code snippet does not pose a security threat.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were found, there are no recommended fixes for this code.
