VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via User-Controlled Data in tsignverify Function

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet shows a part of the tsignverify function where user-controlled data ($prefix) is used to construct a string without proper input validation. This allows a potential attacker to manipulate the verification process by injecting malicious data.

Additionally, in line 3, the data in $fips_key is used without input validation or sanitization, introducing the possibility of an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) attack.

Moreover, line 4 uses $fips_pub_key without input validation or sanitization. Although this variable is defined and passed as an argument, this snippet does not contain information about its origin, making it also a potential source of IDOR vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address these potential vulnerabilities, implement the following changes:

- Validate the input for the tsignverify function by checking for valid string types and restricting characters to prevent possible injections.
- Sanitize user-controlled data ($prefix) before using it to construct the string in $testtext.
- Validate $fips_key and $fips_pub_key before using them to prevent IDOR attacks.
- Consider using functions that check for the integrity and authenticity of $fips_key and $fips_pub_key.
