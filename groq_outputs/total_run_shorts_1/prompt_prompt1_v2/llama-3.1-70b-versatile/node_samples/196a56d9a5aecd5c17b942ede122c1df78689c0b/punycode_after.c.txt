VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5, 66, 102
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
This code is vulnerable to buffer overflow and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

EXPLANATION:
There are multiple issues in the provided code snippet. 

Firstly, at line 5, there's a potential buffer overflow issue in the `memmove` function if `written_out - i` exceeds the allocated size of `pDecoded`. Although we cannot confirm the allocated size of `pDecoded` due to missing code, the possibility still exists.

Secondly, there's another potential buffer overflow at line 66, where the function uses `strncpy` equivalent (`for (i = 0; i < delta + 1; i++) PUSHC(inptr[i]);`) to copy a substring to the `outptr` buffer. However, this issue is mitigated by the `if (size++ < maxsize)` condition in the `PUSHC` macro.

Lastly, at line 102, the function uses `strlen(inptr)` to calculate the size of the input string. However, there's a check for `NULL` termination which prevents the code from overflowing the buffer.

Actually, the most serious issue is at line 102 as well. 
The `strchr` function is used to search for the first occurrence of '.' in the `inptr` string. However, when `tmpptr` is `NULL`, which means the '.' character is not found in the `inptr` string, the function will then call `strlen(inptr)`. This will lead to a potential buffer overflow issue if `inptr` is not null-terminated. 

However, another more important issue can be identified at line 102. When `tmpptr` is `NULL`, `strlen(inptr)` is used to calculate the length of the remaining string, but it does not handle the case when `inptr` points to a string which is not null-terminated and overflows the maximum allowed size. 

However, following this there is a bug that `delta` is calculated with `(size_t)(tmpptr - inptr)` but code still treats it as a 1 based index ( with `delta + 1` ) such as at the line `for (i = 0; i < delta + 1; i++) PUSHC(inptr[i]);`. This seems to cause an off by one error issue ( may result in index out of bounds issue). This issue results in the 3rd and most major bug.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. To avoid potential buffer overflow, we should ensure that `written_out - i` does not exceed the allocated size of `pDecoded`.
2. The code should check if the input string `inptr` is null-terminated before calculating its length using `strlen(inptr)`. This is to prevent potential buffer overflow issues. 
3. We need to ensure the loop at line 66 does not exceed `maxsize`. This is achieved by the code (`if (size++ < maxsize)`) 
4. We should recalculate the value of `delta` at line 102 ( by using the value `delta - 1`).

Here's a revised version of the problematic lines of code at lines 66 and 102:

```
// Line 66
for (i = 0; i < delta; i++) 
    PUSHC(inptr[i]);

// Alternatively we do `delta - 1` but using `delta` may indicate the intention is a 1 based index, however, this results in off by one indexing error in subsequent uses.

// Line 102
size_t delta = tmpptr != NULL ? (size_t)(tmpptr - inptr) : strnlen(inptr, maxsize);
```
