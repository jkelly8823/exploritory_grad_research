VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerability detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a structure or object declaration in C, containing various members related to encryption and application data. After reviewing the code, no potential security vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    /* FIXME: Should this even exist? It appears unused */
    void *app_data;             /* application stuff */

    int iv_len;                 /* IV length */
    unsigned long flags;        /* Various flags */
    void *cipher_data;          /* per EVP data */
