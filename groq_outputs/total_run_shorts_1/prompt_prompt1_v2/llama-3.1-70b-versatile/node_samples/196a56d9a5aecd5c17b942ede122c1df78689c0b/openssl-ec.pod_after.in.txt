VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be documentation for an OpenSSL option related to elliptic curves. The snippet does not contain any executable code or logic that could be exploited. Therefore, no vulnerabilities were found.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed as no vulnerabilities were found.
ORIGINAL CODE:
=item B<-conv_form> I<arg>

This specifies how the points on the elliptic curve are converted
into octet strings. Possible values are: B<compressed>, B<uncompressed> (the
default value) and B<hybrid>. For more information regarding
the point conversion forms please read the X9.62 standard.
B<Note> Due to patent issues the B<compressed> option is disabled
by default for binary curves and can be enabled by defining
the preprocessor macro B<OPENSSL_EC_BIN_PT_COMP> at compile time.
