VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 6
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Possible double-free vulnerability when OBJ_length(asn1obj) returns 0.

EXPLANATION:
When OBJ_length(asn1obj) returns 0, the ASN1_OBJECT_free(asn1obj) function is called immediately, which is not necessarily an issue by itself. However, later on, another call to ASN1_OBJECT_free(pval) is made in the 'err' segment if ptype == V_ASN1_OBJECT. 

Here, if pval is equal to asn1obj (which would occur when OBJ_nid2obj(nid) returns an object whose length is 0), the same ASN1_OBJECT could be freed twice. This is because in the 'err' segment, ASN1_OBJECT_free(pval) could be an invocation of ASN1_OBJECT_free(asn1obj) on the object that has already been freed at line 6.

This could lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this potential vulnerability, make sure that pval is not freed at two different places when it is equal to asn1obj. This could be achieved by adding a check in the 'err' block to see if pval is NULL before attempting to free it. Here is an example of how the code could be modified:

```c
err:
    if (ptype == V_ASN1_OBJECT && pval != NULL)
        ASN1_OBJECT_free(pval);
    else if (ptype != V_ASN1_OBJECT && pval != NULL)
        ASN1_STRING_free(pval);
    OPENSSL_free(penc);
    return 0;
```

Also, set asn1obj to NULL after it is freed to prevent it from being freed again if the same object is used at a different point in the code.

```c
if (asn1obj == NULL || OBJ_length(asn1obj) == 0) {
    ASN1_OBJECT_free(asn1obj);
    asn1obj = NULL;  // Add this line
    ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_EC, EC_R_MISSING_OID);
    return 0;
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
ASN1_OBJECT *asn1obj = OBJ_nid2obj(nid);

if (asn1obj == NULL || OBJ_length(asn1obj) == 0) {
    ASN1_OBJECT_free(asn1obj);
    ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_EC, EC_R_MISSING_OID);
    return 0;
}
*ppval = asn1obj;
ptype, pval, penc, penclen))
return 1;
err:
if (ptype == V_ASN1_OBJECT)
    ASN1_OBJECT_free(pval);
else
    ASN1_STRING_free(pval);
OPENSSL_free(penc);
return 0;
}
eplen = i2d_ECPrivateKey(&ec_key, &ep);
if (eplen <= 0) {
    ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_EC, ERR_R_EC_LIB);
    ASN1_STRING_free(pval);
    return 0;
}

if (!PKCS8_pkey_set0(p8, OBJ_nid2obj(NID_X9_62_id_ecPublicKey), 0,
                     ptype, pval, ep, eplen)) {
    ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_EC, ERR_R_EC_LIB);
    ASN1_STRING_free(pval);
    OPENSSL_clear_free(ep, eplen);
    return 0;
}

return 1;
}
