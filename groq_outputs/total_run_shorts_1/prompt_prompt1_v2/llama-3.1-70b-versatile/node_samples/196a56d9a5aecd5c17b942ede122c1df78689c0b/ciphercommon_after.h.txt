VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to contain preprocessor directives, include statements, and macro definitions for cryptographic constants. Upon examining the provided code, I did not find any security vulnerabilities or potential weaknesses.

The defined constants seem to be used for cryptographic purposes, but none of them are used in a way that introduces a security risk. The include statements are proper and only import internal header files.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No changes are required.
