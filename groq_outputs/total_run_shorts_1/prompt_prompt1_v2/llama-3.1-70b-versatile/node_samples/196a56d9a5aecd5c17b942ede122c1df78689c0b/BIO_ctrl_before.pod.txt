VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet is a documentation block, likely written in POD (Plain Old Documentation) format, which is used to document Perl modules. It provides information about the expected behavior of certain BIO functions, such as their return values and usage.

The provided code does not contain any executable code, but rather serves as documentation for the actual implementation. Since there is no actual code with potential vulnerabilities, I have marked this code as not vulnerable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
returns other negative values if an error occurs.

BIO_pending(), BIO_ctrl_pending(), BIO_wpending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending()
return the amount of pending data.

BIO_get_ktls_send() returns 1 if the BIO is using the Kernel TLS data-path for
sending. Otherwise, it returns zero.
BIO_get_ktls_recv() returns 1 if the BIO is using the Kernel TLS data-path for
supported, if an error occurred, if EOF has not been reached and in
the case of BIO_seek() on a file BIO for a successful operation.

=head1 HISTORY

The BIO_get_ktls_send() and BIO_get_ktls_recv() macros were added in
OpenSSL 3.0. They were modified to never return -1 in OpenSSL 3.0.4.
