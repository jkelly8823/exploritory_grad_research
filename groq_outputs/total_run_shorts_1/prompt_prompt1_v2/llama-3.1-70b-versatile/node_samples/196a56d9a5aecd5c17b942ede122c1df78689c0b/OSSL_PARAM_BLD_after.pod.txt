VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be creating an OSSL_PARAM array that contains an RSA key and performing error checking on the creation. The code is properly checking for errors on each operation and is freeing the OSSL_PARAM_BLD object after use. No vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, or insecure data handling, were identified in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider using constants instead of magic numbers for error codes and status checks.
- The function appears to be handling two similar blocks of code. Refactor the code to follow the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle to make it more maintainable.
- The use of the `goto` statement may be undesirable in some cases. Consider replacing it with more modern error-handling techniques, such as exceptions or error codes.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    OSSL_PARAM *params = NULL;

    if (bld == NULL
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "n", n)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_uint(bld, "e", e)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "d", d)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "rsa-factor1", p)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "rsa-factor2", q)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "rsa-exponent1", dmp1)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "rsa-exponent2", dmq1)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "rsa-coefficient1", iqmp)
        || (params = OSSL_PARAM_BLD_to_param(bld)) == NULL)
        goto err;
    OSSL_PARAM_BLD_free(bld);
    /* Use params */

    if (nld == NULL
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_BN(bld, "n", n)
        || !OSSL_PARAM_BLD_push_uint(bld, "e", e)
        || (params = OSSL_PARAM_BLD_to_param(bld)) == NULL)
        goto err;
    OSSL_PARAM_BLD_free(bld);
    /* Use params */
