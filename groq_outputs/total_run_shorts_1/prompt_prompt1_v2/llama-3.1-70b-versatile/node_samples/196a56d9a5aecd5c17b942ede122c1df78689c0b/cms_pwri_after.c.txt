VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure generation of cryptographic initialization vector (IV) is not present, but unverified function, RAND_bytes_ex, is potentially using untrustworthy entropy.
However a different issue is present: the function ERR_raise will terminate program control flow, but it does not clear sensitive data.
EXPLANATION:
The code checks the length of the initialization vector (IV) before generating a random IV. However, when handling an error in `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_CMS, ERR_R_EVP_LIB)`, potentially sensitive data is left un-cleared on the stack or in other storage locations.
Unfortunately, no lines are directly flagged as `VULNERABLE_LINES` as they are securely calling RAND_bytes_ex here, but this issue exists after the error gets handled.
It would be beneficial to manually review the source to clear data used prior to this point.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Clear all sensitive data after generating error during error handling routines.
Consider implementing Secure Coding principles to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data during errors.
Note that it is not explicitly part of this analysis to search for such existing erasure to verify its occurrence.
The use of err label for returning after failing should also indicate clearing data prior to handling that failure more meticulously.
