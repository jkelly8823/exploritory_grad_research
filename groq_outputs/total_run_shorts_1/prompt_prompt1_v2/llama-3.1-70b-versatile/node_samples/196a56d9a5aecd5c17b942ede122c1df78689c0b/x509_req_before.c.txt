VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-6, 67-69
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Buffer Overflow and Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities are not present in this code but we do find Integer overflow vulnerability. This code also uses indirect memory access which could lead to buffer overflows.

EXPLANATION: 
The Integer overflow vulnerability lies in the i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs function, where we see an unsigned char **pp parameter, which if its length is not properly validated could lead to integer overflow. Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are typically found when we see memcpy() or strcpy() functions are used; they are found in this code snippet, however we cannot be certain of its likelihood of occurrence because not every part is shown. There is an instance of &req->req_info.enc.modified at the start of the function call, this example of code doesn't define what type is this variable thus we assume it's of type 'int' to indicate that memory has been modified - an indirect memory access with variable 'req' - this could pose problems because it uses indirect memory access; however, req is checked for a valid state first before actually being modified - (req->req_info.enc) and subsequently then checked for its null state.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Check for integer overflows, especially when referring to type casting. 
- Define variables properly and always use pre-incremental or post-incremental values for checking.
-  X509_REQ *req could potentially result from a bad function call, we would thus recommend careful checking and input validation before using any related variables to it.
- Always check length and offset before making use of pointers.
