VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a collection of function prototypes or declarations for an OpenSSL method store. It does not contain any explicit vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or command injection. The functions seem to be properly declared, and the parameters are well-defined.

The snippet does not contain any implementation, which is where most vulnerabilities are typically found. The declarations themselves do not provide enough context to determine if the functions are correctly used elsewhere in the codebase.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
