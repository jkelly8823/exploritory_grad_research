VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet appears to be a portion of a larger file, likely from a library or other project, that involves conditional preprocessor directives and macro definitions. It does not perform any direct operations that would indicate a vulnerability.

The code seems to be checking for specific compiler and standards version conditions to decide whether to use certain attributes or not. It does not use any dynamic data or perform any operations that would suggest a vulnerability.

As this is a relatively static code snippet, and no inputs are taken from users or external sources, there are no obvious security concerns.
