VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Potential Resource Leak Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
 The code snippet lacks a corresponding "free" or cleanup call for the memory allocated by RAND_bytes_ex, if successful. While it does check the return value of RAND_bytes_ex and handle the error case with a goto statement, there's no guarantee that the memory allocated by RAND_bytes_ex will be properly released, regardless of whether an error occurs or not. Without seeing the complete code, it's unclear if the memory is freed later, but based on this snippet alone, it's a potential resource leak.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
 Include a call to free the memory allocated by RAND_bytes_ex. However, considering the project's use of OpenSSL, no explicit call to free is required for memory allocated by OpenSSL. It is typically managed by the OpenSSL library, so you should use OPENSSL_free instead if you're manually managing the memory.

Additionally, it's a good practice to check the return values of function calls like RAND_bytes_ex and handle possible errors accordingly. However, the given code snippet already handles the Return value for RAND_bytes_ex.
