VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14-15
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential Resource Leak or Use After Free.
EXPLANATION:
In the provided code snippet, the `WPACKET_cleanup(&pkt)` function is called regardless of the outcome of `ssl_close_construct_packet(s, &pkt, mt)` and `WPACKET_finish(&pkt)`. However, in the event of an error during these two function calls, the resources allocated by `pkt` might not have been properly cleaned up. Additionally, there's a possibility that the `pkt` is used after being cleaned up, which would result in a use-after-free vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To prevent the potential resource leak or use-after-free vulnerability, ensure that the `pkt` is properly cleaned up after its resources have been used and freed. It's essential to guarantee that `WPACKET_finish(&pkt)` is called before `WPACKET_cleanup(&pkt)` to ensure proper resource release.

If the `WPACKET_cleanup(&pkt)` call is also intended to free the resources even in case of failure, then it's recommended to add an additional check to verify that `pkt` is not being used after `WPACKET_cleanup(&pkt)` is called.

Example of fixed code:
```c
// ...

if (ssl_close_construct_packet(s, &pkt, mt)) {
    WPACKET_finish(&pkt);
    // pkt is now finished and its resources are freed by WPACKET_finish()
} else {
    // error occurred during ssl_close_construct_packet
    WPACKET_cleanup(&pkt);  // ensure pkt's resources are cleaned up
}

// never use pkt again after WPACKET_cleanup()
```
