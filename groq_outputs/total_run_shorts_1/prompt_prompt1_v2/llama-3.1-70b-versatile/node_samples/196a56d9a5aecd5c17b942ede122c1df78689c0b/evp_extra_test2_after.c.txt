VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 62-65
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Use of deprecated and insecure cryptographic algorithms (DES and MD5).

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes the usage of the DES and MD5 algorithms, which are considered deprecated and insecure. Specifically, the EVP_PBE_alg_add function is used to add a PBES (Password-Based Encryption Scheme) algorithm, which in this case is pbeWithMD5AndDES_CBC. This algorithm is based on the insecure MD5 and DES algorithms. The use of these algorithms can make the application vulnerable to various attacks, such as collisions and brute-force attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to replace the deprecated and insecure DES and MD5 algorithms with more modern and secure alternatives. Some options include:

* Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of DES for encryption.
* Using a secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of MD5.
* Using a secure PBES algorithm, such as PBKDF2 or Argon2, instead of pbeWithMD5AndDES_CBC.

It is also recommended to review the code and applications that use these algorithms and update them to use more secure alternatives.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#if !defined OPENSSL_NO_DES && !defined OPENSSL_NO_MD5
static int test_evp_pbe_alg_add(void)
{
    int ret = 0;
    int cipher_nid = 0, md_nid = 0;
    EVP_PBE_KEYGEN_EX *keygen_ex = NULL;
    EVP_PBE_KEYGEN *keygen = NULL;

    if (!TEST_true(EVP_PBE_alg_add(NID_pbeWithMD5AndDES_CBC, EVP_des_cbc(), EVP_md5(),
                                   PKCS5_PBE_keyivgen)))
        goto err;

    if (!TEST_true(EVP_PBE_find_ex(EVP_PBE_TYPE_OUTER, NID_pbeWithMD5AndDES_CBC,
                                   &cipher_nid, &md_nid, &keygen, &keygen_ex)))
        goto err;

    if (!TEST_true(keygen != NULL))
        goto err;
    if (!TEST_true(keygen_ex == NULL))
        goto err;

    ret = 1;

    return ret;
