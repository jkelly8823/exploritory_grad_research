VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No notable vulnerabilities were detected in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a section of a larger program that handles compiler-specific definitions for initialization and finalization functions. It uses directives specific to GCC and IBM AIX compilers to set up constructors and destructors. The code is clean, and there are no indications of potential security issues such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting. The code lacks user input handling and sensitive operations, making it less susceptible to common vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommended fixes are needed for the given code snippet.
