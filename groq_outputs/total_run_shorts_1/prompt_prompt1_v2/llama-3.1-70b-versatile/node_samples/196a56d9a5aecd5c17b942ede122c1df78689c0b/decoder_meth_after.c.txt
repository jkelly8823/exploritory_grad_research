VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Dereferencing a NULL pointer may cause this program to crash or have undefined behavior. The variable 'store' is not checked for NULL before it's used, potentially resulting in a crash or security vulnerability.
EXPLANATION:
The `store` variable is not thoroughly validated for NULL before it's used in multiple locations. In the `reserve_decoder_store` and `unreserve_decoder_store` functions, the `store` variable is checked for NULL and, if NULL, another value is assigned to it. However, there is a logical issue in this handling which allows a NULL 'store' to cause the functions to return 0 without any error handling or warning. Similarly, in the `get_decoder_from_store` function, the `store` variable is dereferenced and used in multiple calls without thorough NULL checks, which could also result in a crash.

Additionally, this could potentially result in a denial of service (DoS) or undefined behavior because these functions handle memory allocation and deallocation, as well as locking/unlocking of stores.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Valid NULL checks should be added in the functions to prevent crashes and ensure the stability of the application. The recommendations are as follows:

1.  In `reserve_decoder_store` and `unreserve_decoder_store`, if `store` is NULL and `store` is reassigned from `get_decoder_store`, the functions return immediately if it's still NULL. However, no error handling or information is logged, so it should ideally report the failure to allocate memory.
2.  In the `get_decoder_from_store` function, add more robust NULL checks for `store` before calling any function that uses it.

    A safe check could be implemented by explicitely checking if the store is NULL, like this:

    ```c
if(store == NULL){
    // Handle error, log information, and return accordingly
}
```
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
static int reserve_decoder_store(void *store, void *data)
{
    struct decoder_data_st *methdata = data;

    if (store == NULL
        && (store = get_decoder_store(methdata->libctx)) == NULL)
        return 0;

    return ossl_method_lock_store(store);
}

static int unreserve_decoder_store(void *store, void *data)
{
    struct decoder_data_st *methdata = data;

    if (store == NULL
        && (store = get_decoder_store(methdata->libctx)) == NULL)
        return 0;

    return ossl_method_unlock_store(store);
}

/* Get decoder methods from a store, or put one in */

                                    void *data)
