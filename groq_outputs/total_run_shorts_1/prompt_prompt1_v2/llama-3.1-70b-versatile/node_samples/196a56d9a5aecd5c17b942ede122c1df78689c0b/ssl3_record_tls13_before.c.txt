VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No identified vulnerabilities found in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
After reviewing the provided code snippet, I did not identify any potential vulnerabilities. This is likely due to the snippet mainly focusing on initializing variables and performing some conditional checks. There are no apparent security-sensitive operations or potential paths to sensitive data manipulation. Additionally, since we're ignoring warnings or issues stemming from missing information, the absence of variable definitions, import statements, or other missing components did not flag any potential threats.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were identified, no recommendations for fixes are provided. However, considering the project seems to involve cryptographic primitives and security-sensitive data, I would advise ensuring that variable initialization and secure coding practices are consistently followed throughout the broader codebase to prevent potential threats.
