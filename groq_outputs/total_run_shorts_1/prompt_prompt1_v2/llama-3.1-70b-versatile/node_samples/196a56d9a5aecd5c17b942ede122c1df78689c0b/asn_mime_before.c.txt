VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 59, likely 15 may have issues if one looks at typical designs, not in the snippet however.
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code contains an error handling vulnerability due to a non-checking return after call to ERR_raise. This could result in undefined behavior if an error is raised and execution attempts to continue.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet contains an example of error handling that directly calls `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_ASN1, ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE);` and immediately follows it with `return 0;`. This approach to handling error events with error returned is alright so long as no side effect happens between them, but no side effect isn't visibly assured as other operations happen a little above it with no related checks. Also in snippet there isn't anything to prove dependency on any variables' values modified in above lines before the return happens and the function does not maintain any internal states visible here.
However I did notice in `bf = BIO_new(BIO_f_buffer());` a call that if failed, directly returned without any other code being possibly modified, on this line above calling err_r in typical designs can lead to use after free. But looking at context likely isn't present here, here any use of `bf` is protected and the use cases here aren't modified prior the functions exiting this stack.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
So to clearly prevent code coverage and maintain best practices with handling if related states may change and the values don't directly get checked in any returned variables: before return statement implement internal state resetting (if any changes), potentially err handling with context of `bf` err, then ideally re-raising `ERR_raise(ERR_LIB_ASN1, ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE)`, only if necessary contextually. I would consider this with a minor priority with this snippet as context isn't fully with regard to prior variable modifications.
