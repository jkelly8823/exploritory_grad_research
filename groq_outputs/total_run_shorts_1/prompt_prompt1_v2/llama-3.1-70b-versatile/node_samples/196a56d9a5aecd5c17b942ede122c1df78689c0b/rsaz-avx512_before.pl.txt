VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 13-13
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection.

EXPLANATION:
The code is vulnerable to Command Injection in the line where it opens the OUT filehandle for writing. The command being executed is constructed by joining several values, including `$xlate`, `$flavour`, and `$output`. These values are not properly sanitized before being used in the command, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious commands. Specifically, the issue lies in the fact that the variable `"$xlate"` is not validated for malicious content, and is executed as a system command with potential elevated privileges.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Validate Input**: Verify that the inputs provided to `$xlate`, `$flavour`, and `$output` are properly sanitized and validated for malicious content.
2. **Use System calls safely**: Where possible, use safe functions to execute system commands instead of making the shell evaluate command from potentially tainted variables.
3. **Avoid Untrusted Data**: Identify non-trusted input sources that can manipulate commands executed. Take further action to protect your application if an open door in that direction is identified.
