VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were found in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a standard C program header, including the necessary header files for complex numbers and RSA encryption. The code respects good practices by including header files only when necessary and following proper conditional compilation directives.

The code also correctly defines a main function and includes the standard library for memory management. However, without additional functionality or usage of RSA encryption functions, there are no apparent vulnerabilities in this code.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed, as the code does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities.
