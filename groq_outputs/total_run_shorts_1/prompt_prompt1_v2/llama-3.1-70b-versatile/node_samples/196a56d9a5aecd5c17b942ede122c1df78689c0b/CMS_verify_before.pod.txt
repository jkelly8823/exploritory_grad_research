VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability has been identified in the provided code.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code is a documentation snippet from a Perl module, describing the usage of CMS verify functionality. It does not contain any executable code and is therefore not vulnerable to typical software vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
This code is informational and is not susceptible to common software vulnerabilities. However, it is essential to ensure that the functions and variables mentioned in this documentation are used correctly and securely in the actual implementation.
ORIGINAL CODE:
(there is no code to include, just documentation)

If this code was describing a real application, note the following design concerns:

Using `CMS_NO_CONTENT_VERIFY` can be potentially insecure if it allows modified content to be considered valid.
Ignoring certificates in the message itself might be a security issue when using `CMS_NOINTERN`.
