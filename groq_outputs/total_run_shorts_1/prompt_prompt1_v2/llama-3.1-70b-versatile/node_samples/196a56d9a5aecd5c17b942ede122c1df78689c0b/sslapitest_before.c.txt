VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code has multiple issues with memory management and potential buffer overflows.

EXPLANATION:
The functions `test_serverinfo` and `test_ticket_callbacks` contain hard-coded arrays used as sources for initialization and assignments to other buffers. In some cases, these hard-coded arrays are not checked for null-termination before being passed to other functions. 

In `test_serverinfo`, `serverinfov1` and `serverinfov2` are sent directly to `SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_ex` and `SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo`, which could result in an out-of-bounds write if the buffer lengths are not properly validated. 

Furthermore, in `test_ticket_callbacks`, there is a format string vulnerability due to the use of `NULL`-terminated strings as format specifiers with the `OSSL_PARAM_construct_utf8_string` function. 

Additionally, there are missing null checks when fetching ciphers, e.g., in the line where `ciph = EVP_CIPHER_fetch(NULL, fetchable_ciphers[test_index], "")` is called. This could potentially result in a null pointer dereference. However, in the given code snippet, no such dereference occurs.


The criticality of the memory management and buffer overflow issues are Hardcoded array usage in sensitive OpenSSL functionality may allow possible exploitation by malicious entities to gain access or manipulate system resources.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
-   Ensure all memory buffers are thoroughly validated for size and correctness before passing them to OpenSSL's `SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo` or other SSL/TLS functions.
-   Double-check OpenSSL documentation to use correct library functions and handle return values properly.
-   Perform stricter scrutiny for any hardcoded array or format string usage to prevent buffer overflows and potential exploits.
