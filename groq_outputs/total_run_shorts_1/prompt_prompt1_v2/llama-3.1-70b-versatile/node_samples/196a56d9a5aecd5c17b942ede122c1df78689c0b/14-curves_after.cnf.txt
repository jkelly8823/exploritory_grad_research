VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is using weak elliptic curves for TLS connections. Many of the curves used are curve names defined by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), SECG ( Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group) and others. Those elliptic curve names don't give sufficient information to know whether the code uses these curves with a secure key size for ECDH or ECDHE or not, but unfortunately the use of short names has as an example the benefit to help avoid attacks on the weak curves, the issue we can determine with information available for this examination.


EXPLANATION:
Curve names defined by standards groups and given by standard names for secure curves should be looked up on the internet for recommended safe usage as an attack on weak curves could severely affect the confidentiality or integrity of data being sent in such encryption schemes when an attacker being able to access information related to curve parameters.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
Use more secure elliptic curves like secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1 or Curve25519 for ECDH or ECDHE key exchanges.
