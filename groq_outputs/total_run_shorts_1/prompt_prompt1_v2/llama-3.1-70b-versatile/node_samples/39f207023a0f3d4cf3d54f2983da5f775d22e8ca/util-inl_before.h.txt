VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 4-5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to the use of non-constant string comparison with `strlen` and no validation on the `filename`. However, the code snippet doesn't explicitly demonstrate this using `strlen` but the function `StringEqualNoCase` is string comparison. Potential bugs often result from pointer `p`.

EXPLANATION:
The line of code in question directly evaluates a pointer from the result of the function `strrchr`. The input provided to `strrchr` isn't checked to prevent issues relating to characters non existent. Furthermore `strrchr` finds the last occurrence of a designated character so  for example depending on placement the variable `p` in incorrect scenarios could provide unpredictable results and evaluate to a data type which isn't intended.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To address potential bugs, you should input validate on the filename with String pointer to ensure no risks against buffer overrun issues. Validate returned values using function calls `strrchr` if there's no file extension provided. Handling failures is not being completed on a scenario where functions do not complete as completed.

Additionally, it's recommended that developers leverage memory-safe functions and string handling functions should be used instead if the existing implementation is replaceable. Since the String Function Returns Pointer you should monitor returned strings value from the function such as:
```c
char * const p = strrchr(filename, '.');
if (NULL == p) {
  return false; // unable to locate specified character for evaluation
}
```
