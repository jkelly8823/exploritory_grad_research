VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Command Injection Vulnerability through cp.exec()

EXPLANATION:
The vulnerability exists in the `testExec` function. The function uses the `cp.exec` function, which executes a command in a shell. The input `filename` is directly passed to the `cp.exec` function without proper sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious shell commands.

The vulnerability occurs because `cp.exec` is executed in a shell by default, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code by specifying shell special characters in the `filename`. This can potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use child_process.spawn() or child_process.execFile() instead of child_process.exec() for executing the command directly, bypassing the shell. This reduces the risk of shell injection vulnerabilities.
2. If the use of child_process.exec() is unavoidable, ensure proper sanitization of the `filename` input to prevent special characters from being executed by the shell.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
const expectedStatus = isWindows ? 1 : 127;

const suffixes =
    'BAT bAT BaT baT BAt bAt Bat bat CMD cMD CmD cmD CMd cMd Cmd cmd'
    .split(' ');

function testExec(filename) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    cp.exec(filename).once('exit', common.mustCall(function(status) {
