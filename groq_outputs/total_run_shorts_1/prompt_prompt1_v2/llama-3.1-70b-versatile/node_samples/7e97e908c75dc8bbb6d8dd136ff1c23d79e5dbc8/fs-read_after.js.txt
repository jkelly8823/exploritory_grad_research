VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No discernible vulnerabilities were identified in this code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be testing the behavior of Node.js's fs.exists and fs.statfs methods when encountering a file that is expected to be blocked due to permission issues. The tests assert that the fs.exists method should return false without performing I/O, and that fs.statfs should throw an ERR_ACCESS_DENIED error. The code does not seem to introduce any exploitable vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as the code does not appear to have any vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:

    resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
}

// fs.exists
{
  // It will return false (without performing IO) when permissions is not met
  fs.exists(blockedFile, (exists) => {
    assert.equal(exists, false);
  });
}

// fs.statfs
{
  assert.throws(() => {
    fs.statfs(blockedFile, () => {});
  }, common.expectsError({
    code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
    permission: 'FileSystemRead',
    resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
}
