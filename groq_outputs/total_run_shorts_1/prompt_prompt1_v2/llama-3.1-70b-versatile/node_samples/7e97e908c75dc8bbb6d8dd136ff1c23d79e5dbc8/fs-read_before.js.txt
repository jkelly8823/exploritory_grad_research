VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
 Path Traversal Vulnerability
EXPLANATION:
This vulnerability exists because the code uses user-controlled input to traverse the file system. The function 'path.toNamespacedPath' allows arbitrary path manipulation, and the variable 'blockedFile' is used directly as an argument. This can cause the application to access unintended files, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unauthorized actions.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to normalize the 'blockedFile' path using a more secure method, such as 'path.normalize', before passing it to 'path.toNamespacedPath'. This prevents malicious paths from being used to traverse the file system. Additionally, ensure that proper input validation is performed on the 'blockedFile' variable before it is used. This could include checking for allowed extensions, file types, and directory traversal attacks.

ORIGINAL CODE:
    resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
  }));
