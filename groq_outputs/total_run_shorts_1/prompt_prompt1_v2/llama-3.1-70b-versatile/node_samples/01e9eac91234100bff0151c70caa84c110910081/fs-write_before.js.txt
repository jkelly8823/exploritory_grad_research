VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability due to unpredictable filesystem paths.

EXPLANATION: 
The code uses `path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile)` to construct a filesystem path. However, there is no validation or sanitization performed on the `blockedFile` input. This makes it vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the `blockedFile` variable to access sensitive files or directories. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read or manipulate files that they should not have access to.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate and sanitize the `blockedFile` input to ensure it conforms to a predetermined format.
2. Use a whitelist approach to only allow access to specific, predefined files or directories.
3. Implement additional security measures such as file system access controls (e.g., DACLs) to restrict access to sensitive files.
4. Consider using a library or framework that provides safe and secure path manipulation functions.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
  permission: 'FileSystemWrite',
  resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
});
```
