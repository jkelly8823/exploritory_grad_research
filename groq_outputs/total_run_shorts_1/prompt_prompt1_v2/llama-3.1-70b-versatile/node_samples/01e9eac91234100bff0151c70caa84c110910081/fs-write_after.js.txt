VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities found in the given code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
After reviewing the provided code snippet, I did not identify any potential security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be testing file system permission checks using `fs.fchmod` and `fs.fchown` functions. These tests ensure that permission checks are correctly enforced when attempting to change the mode or ownership of a blocked file. The tests also validate that an `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED` error is thrown as expected. The code does not contain any obvious issues with user input validation, buffer overflows, or other common vulnerabilities.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as it does not contain any identified vulnerabilities. However, in a larger context, it's essential to ensure that file paths and other input values are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential security issues.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
  permission: 'FileSystemWrite',
  resource: path.toNamespacedPath(blockedFile),
});
}

// fs.fchown with read-only fd
{
  assert.throws(() => {
    // blocked file is allowed to read
    const fd = fs.openSync(blockedFile, 'r');
    fs.fchmod(fd, 777, common.expectsError({
      code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
    }));
    fs.fchmodSync(fd, 777);
  }, {
    code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
  });
}

// fs.fchmod with read-only fd
{
  assert.throws(() => {
    // blocked file is allowed to read
    const fd = fs.openSync(blockedFile, 'r');
    fs.fchown(fd, 999, 999, common.expectsError({
      code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
    }));
    fs.fchownSync(fd, 999, 999);
  }, {
    code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
  });
}
```
