VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code appears to be a part of an HTTP/2 session implementation in C++, specifically dealing with handling DATA, PUSH_PROMISE, and HEADERS frames. The code seems to handle frames, update the session state, and close streams correctly.

Upon reviewing the code, I did not find any indications of potential security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other common issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are provided since none were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
frame->hd.type);
  switch (frame->hd.type) {
    case NGHTTP2_DATA:
      session->HandleDataFrame(frame);
      break;
    case NGHTTP2_PUSH_PROMISE:
      // Intentional fall-through, handled just like headers frames
    case NGHTTP2_HEADERS:
      session->HandleHeadersFrame(frame);
// Called by OnFrameReceived when a complete DATA frame has been received.
// If we know that this was the last DATA frame (because the END_STREAM flag
// is set), then we'll terminate the readable side of the StreamBase.
void Http2Session::HandleDataFrame(const nghttp2_frame* frame) {
  int32_t id = GetFrameID(frame);
  Debug(this, "handling data frame for stream %d", id);
  Http2Stream* stream = FindStream(id);

  if (!stream->IsDestroyed() && frame->hd.flags & NGHTTP2_FLAG_END_STREAM)
    stream->EmitRead(UV_EOF);
}
