VULNERABLE_LINES: 3, 4
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code snippet uses a macro to define multiple constants. Two of the constants are being referenced with potentially outdated or unpatched vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
The `SECURITY_REVERSIONS` macro is used to define constants for multiple/security-related issues, specifically CVE-2019-9514 and CVE-2019-9516. Both of these represent real-world vulnerabilities. The presence of hardcoded strings within these constants could imply that they might be referenced later within the codebase, potentially bypassing updated mitigations if not reviewed regularly.

However, in the context of this code snippet alone, there are no obvious signs of execution-based or logic vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, buffer overflow, etc.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Regularly review the `SECURITY_REVERSIONS` macro to ensure all CVEs are resolved by installed security patches and there are no upcoming version inconsistencies.
- Add clear comments whenever adding or referencing vulnerability-based constants for long-term project maintenance.

ORIGINAL CODE:
#define SECURITY_REVERSIONS(XX)                                            \
  XX(CVE_2019_9514, "CVE-2019-9514", "HTTP/2 Reset Flood")                 \
  XX(CVE_2019_9516, "CVE_2019_9516", "HTTP/2 0-Length Headers Leak")       \
//  XX(CVE_2016_PEND, "CVE-2016-PEND", "Vulnerability Title")
  // TODO(addaleax): Remove all of the above before Node.js 13 as the comment
  // at the start of the file indicates.
