VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No apparent vulnerabilities found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be configuring some timeouts and setting up the prototype chain for a custom Server class that inherits from the tls.Server class in Node.js. 
The code does not seem to be handling any user input or interacting with any external systems in an insecure manner. 
No obvious vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or command injection, were found. 
However, it is essential to review this code in the context of the entire project to ensure that there are no hidden vulnerabilities or issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations for fixing a vulnerability in this code are available, as no vulnerabilities were found.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
this.keepAliveTimeout = 5000;
this.maxHeadersCount = null;
this.headersTimeout = 60 * 1000; // 60 seconds
this.requestTimeout = 120 * 1000; // 120 seconds
}
ObjectSetPrototypeOf(Server.prototype, tls.Server.prototype);
ObjectSetPrototypeOf(Server, tls.Server);
```
