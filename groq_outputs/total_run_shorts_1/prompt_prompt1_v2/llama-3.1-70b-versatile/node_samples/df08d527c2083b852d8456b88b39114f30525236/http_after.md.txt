VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No explicit vulnerability was detected in the given code snippet, however a potential security consideration was noted.

EXPLANATION:
Although no vulnerability was directly identified, the comment hinting at protection against potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks suggests that setting a non-zero request timeout is essential for security. The given code snippet, however, doesn't actually set a timeout or even present code - it's just documentation.

If the corresponding function calls or assignments are missing or incorrectly used elsewhere in the codebase, then that could lead to potential issues such as Slowloris or similar low-and-slow DoS attacks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Implement correct setting of the server's request timeout, ensuring it is non-zero (e.g., `server.setTimeout(120 * 1000);`). This not only helps protect against DoS attacks but also to establish a default timeout for potentially slow clients.

ORIGINAL CODE:


Limits maximum incoming headers count. If set to 0, no limit will be applied.

### `server.requestTimeout`
<!-- YAML
added: REPLACEME
-->

* {number} **Default:** `0`

Sets the timeout value in milliseconds for receiving the entire request from
the client.

If the timeout expires, the server responds with status 408 without
forwarding the request to the request listener and then closes the connection.

It must be set to a non-zero value (e.g. 120 seconds) to proctect against
potential Denial-of-Service attacks in case the server is deployed without a
reverse proxy in front.
