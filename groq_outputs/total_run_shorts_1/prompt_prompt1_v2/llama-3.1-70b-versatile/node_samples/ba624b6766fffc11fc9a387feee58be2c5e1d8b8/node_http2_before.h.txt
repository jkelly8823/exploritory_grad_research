VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability was detected in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a declaration of an enumeration and a function pointer type. The enumeration defines constants for different session states, and the function pointer type gets a setting value for a given session. This code does not contain any inherent vulnerabilities, as it only defines constants and a function pointer type without any executable code that could be exploited.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed for this code snippet, as it does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
SESSION_STATE_CLOSED = 0x4,
SESSION_STATE_CLOSING = 0x8,
SESSION_STATE_SENDING = 0x10,
};

typedef uint32_t(*get_setting)(nghttp2_session* session,
                                 nghttp2_settings_id id);
