VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a CMake configuration file. It defines a static library for unittests and sets its properties. The code also installs the library to a specified destination.

Our analysis did not find any potential vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The use of variables and functions is proper, and there are no apparent issues with data handling or execution. The `HAVE_CUNIT` check and conditional compilation is properly used to handle the presence or absence of the CUnit library.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/includes"
)

if(HAVE_CUNIT)
  # Static library (for unittests because of symbol visibility)
  add_library(nghttp2_static STATIC ${NGHTTP2_SOURCES})
  set_target_properties(nghttp2_static PROPERTIES
    COMPILE_FLAGS "${WARNCFLAGS}"
    ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME nghttp2
  )
  target_compile_definitions(nghttp2_static PUBLIC "-DNGHTTP2_STATICLIB")
endif()

install(TARGETS nghttp2
  DESTINATION "${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}")
