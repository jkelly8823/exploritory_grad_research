VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No vulnerabilities detected.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a section of a C/C++ library that makes use of the nghttp2 library. It defines two functions: `nghttp2_session_set_stream_user_data` and `nghttp2_session_set_user_data`. Both functions are defined with memory-safe practices and do not handle any sensitive data in an insecure manner.

The first function sets the stream user data for a given session and stream ID. The second function sets the user data for a given session, overwriting the existing user data.

Given the information available, it seems that the provided functions follow secure coding practices. However, without seeing the implementation of these functions, it is impossible to rule out potential vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since no vulnerabilities were detected in the provided code snippet, no recommendations for changes are necessary.
