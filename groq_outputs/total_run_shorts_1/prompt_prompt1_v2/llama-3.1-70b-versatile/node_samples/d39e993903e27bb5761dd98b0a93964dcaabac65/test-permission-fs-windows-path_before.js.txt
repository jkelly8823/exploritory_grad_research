VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 1
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The vulnerability is a potential issue with unhandled exception that can cause a denial of service. The assert statements do not have error handling.

EXPLANATION:
The code uses assert statements to enforce correctness, but does not handle potential errors or exceptions. If an assertion fails, the process will crash and provide limited information about the cause of the failure. This could potentially cause a denial of service and also make it harder to debug issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use try-catch blocks around the assert statements to catch any potential errors.
2. Handle the errors and exceptions explicitly, rather than letting the process crash.

RECOMMENDATION EXAMPLE:
```javascript
try {
  assert.strictEqual(stdout.toString(), 'true\n', stderr.toString());
  assert.strictEqual(status, 0);
} catch (err) {
  // Log and handle the error
  console.error('Error:', err);
  // Consider additional actions, such as exiting the process with a non-zero status code
  process.exit(1);
}
```

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
assert.strictEqual(stdout.toString(), 'true\n', stderr.toString());
assert.strictEqual(status, 0);
```
