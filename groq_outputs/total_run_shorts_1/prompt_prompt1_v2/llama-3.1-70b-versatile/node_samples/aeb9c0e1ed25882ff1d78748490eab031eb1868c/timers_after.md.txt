VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
This code snippet appears to be part of a documentation or API description, and does not include any executable code that could potentially contain vulnerabilities.
EXPLANATION:
Since the provided code is purely documentation and does not contain any actual code, it is not possible for me to identify any vulnerabilities. The snippet appears to describe two methods (`timersPromises.scheduler.wait` and `timersPromises.scheduler.yield`) and their respective stability levels, but no actual code is present.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since this code snippet is purely documentation and does not contain any actual vulnerabilities, no recommendations are needed. However, as a general advice, when writing actual code that implements these methods, ensure to follow best practices for secure coding.
ORIGINAL CODE:
### `timersPromises.scheduler.wait(delay[, options])`

<!-- YAML
added: v17.3.0

> Stability: 1 - Experimental

### `timersPromises.scheduler.yield()`

<!-- YAML
added: v17.3.0
