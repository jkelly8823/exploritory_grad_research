VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No explicit vulnerability was identified in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not contain any code that can be executed. It appears to be documentation or a code comment describing a function or method named `getActiveResourcesInfo()`. The provided YAML-added metadata likely corresponds to version control data, and the stability flag set to "Experimental" suggests that this code may still be under development. However, no specific vulnerability can be identified based on this information alone. To assess the security of the code, I would need the actual implementation of `getActiveResourcesInfo()`.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations can be made without seeing the actual code implementation. Ensure to evaluate the implementation of `getActiveResourcesInfo()` for potential security vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
## `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()`

added: REPLACEME
