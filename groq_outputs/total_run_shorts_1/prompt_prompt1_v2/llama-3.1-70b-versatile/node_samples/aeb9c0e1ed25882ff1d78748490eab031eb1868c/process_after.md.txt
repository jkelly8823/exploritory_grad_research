VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: None (note: no actual code was provided)
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The provided code segment does not contain actual code, but rather appears to be a documentation comment for a method or function. However, the "Stability: 1 - Experimental" label indicates that the code this comment describes may be vulnerable to issues due to its experimental nature.

EXPLANATION:
Although no specific code was provided, the comment block suggests that the code in question utilizes an experimental feature, process.getActiveResourcesInfo(). As this feature is explicitly labeled as experimental and carries a stability rating of 1, there is inherently more risk associated with its usage. Experimental features can change significantly between releases, may not be thoroughly tested, and can introduce unexpected behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To mitigate potential risks associated with the usage of experimental features, consider the following recommendations:
1. Evaluate if the use of this experimental feature is truly necessary for the application's requirements. If not, consider alternative solutions using more mature features.
2. Ensure thorough testing and validation are performed when using experimental features to catch potential issues early on.
3. Review the documentation regularly for updates on the feature's stability status. Be prepared for potential refactoring if the feature evolves significantly.
4. Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to quickly identify and react to any unforeseen behavior.
