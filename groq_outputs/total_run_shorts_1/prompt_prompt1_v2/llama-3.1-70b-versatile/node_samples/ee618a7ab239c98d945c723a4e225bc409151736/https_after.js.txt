VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a configuration setup for an HTTP server. It sets various timeout values and headers count. It also inherits properties from the `tls.Server` and `HttpServer` classes. However, no obvious vulnerabilities are present in this code snippet. The configuration values are hardcoded and do not seem to be influenced by any user-controlled input.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None
ORIGINAL CODE:
```
this.timeout = 2 * 60 * 1000;
this.keepAliveTimeout = 5000;
this.maxHeadersCount = null;
this.headersTimeout = 40 * 1000; // 40 seconds
}
inherits(Server, tls.Server);

Server.prototype.setTimeout = HttpServer.prototype.setTimeout;
```
