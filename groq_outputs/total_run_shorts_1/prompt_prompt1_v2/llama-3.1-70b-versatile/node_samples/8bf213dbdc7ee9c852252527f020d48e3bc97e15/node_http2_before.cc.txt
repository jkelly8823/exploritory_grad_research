VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 5
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Potential Use After Free vulnerability.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet includes an inline function `RemoveStream` that seems to be responsible for removing a stream from the `Http2Session` class. However, the function sets the `stream` to be removed as `nullptr` only after it has been removed from the `streams_` data structure. This can lead to a situation where the stream is still used elsewhere in the code after its removal (and potential destruction) from the session.

In particular, the `Http2Stream` object is erased from the `streams_` map, but there is no guarantee that the `stream` pointer will be set to `nullptr` in other parts of the code that may hold a reference to this stream. This can result in use-after-free issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix the potential vulnerability, the `stream` pointer should be set to `nullptr` in all locations where it is used, after the stream has been removed from the session. Here is a suggested modification:

```cpp
inline void Http2Session::RemoveStream(Http2Stream* stream) {
  stream->session_ = nullptr;  // set stream to nullptr to prevent use after free
  streams_.erase(stream->id());
  DecrementCurrentSessionMemory(stream->self_size());
}
```

It is also recommended to add additional checks in the `RemoveStream` method to ensure that the stream is not being used elsewhere in the code before it is removed and potentially destroyed.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
Http2Session::~Http2Session() {
  CHECK_EQ(flags_ & SESSION_STATE_HAS_SCOPE, 0);
  Debug(this, "freeing nghttp2 session");
  for (const auto& stream : streams_)
    stream.second->session_ = nullptr;
  nghttp2_session_del(session_);
}

std::string Http2Session::diagnostic_name() const {


inline void Http2Session::RemoveStream(Http2Stream* stream) {
  streams_.erase(stream->id());
  DecrementCurrentSessionMemory(stream->self_size());
}
```

Please note that a review of the complete codebase is recommended to ensure that this fix addresses all potential use-after-free issues.
