VULNERABLE: NO

EXPLANATION:
We could not identify any vulnerabilities within the provided code snippet. This snippet appears to be a class declaration in C++ and the assigned values for the variables seem reasonable and do not raise any obvious security concerns. All variables are initialized with default values or assigned a constant.

However, note that the presence of `NGHTTP2_STREAM_FLAG_NONE` suggests that this code may be related to HTTP/2 protocol handling. The flags and codes used may be associated with potential security risks if not handled correctly in the larger context of the project, but this specific snippet is innocuous.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
1. Ensure proper validation and error handling for HTTP/2 stream flags and state transitions.
2. Verify that the `NGHTTP2_STREAM_FLAG_NONE` flag is correctly cleared/set appropriately when handling different states of the HTTP/2 stream.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
Statistics statistics_ = {};

private:
Http2Session* session_;                       // The Parent HTTP/2 Session
int32_t id_;                                  // The Stream Identifier
int32_t code_ = NGHTTP2_NO_ERROR;             // The RST_STREAM code (if any)
int flags_ = NGHTTP2_STREAM_FLAG_NONE;        // Internal state flags

uint32_t max_header_pairs_ = DEFAULT_MAX_HEADER_LIST_PAIRS;
```
