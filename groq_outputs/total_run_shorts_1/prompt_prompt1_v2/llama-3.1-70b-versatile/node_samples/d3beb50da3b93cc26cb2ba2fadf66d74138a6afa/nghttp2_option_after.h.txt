VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: Potential buffer overflow vulnerability in handling settings and acknowledgments
EXPLANATION: 
The code snippet suggests that the `max_outbound_ack` and `max_settings` fields may be used to store values for maximum outbound acknowledgments and settings in an HTTP/2 session. However, the lack of bounds checking for these values could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if an attacker were to manipulate these values.

The use of `size_t` for these variables indicates that they are used to store sizes of objects, but without additional checks, it's possible that these values could exceed the maximum valid size, resulting in integer overflows.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Ensure that `max_outbound_ack` and `max_settings` values are validated and checked against minimum and maximum acceptable values to prevent integer overflows. Consider adding bounds checking to prevent values that could cause buffer overflows.

Additionally, ensure that when handling these values in code, they are not used in a way that could lead to buffer overflows. For example, when allocating memory or copying data using these values.

ORIGINAL CODE:
NGHTTP2_OPT_MAX_DEFLATE_DYNAMIC_TABLE_SIZE = 1 << 9,
NGHTTP2_OPT_NO_CLOSED_STREAMS = 1 << 10,
NGHTTP2_OPT_MAX_OUTBOUND_ACK = 1 << 11,
NGHTTP2_OPT_MAX_SETTINGS = 1 << 12,
} nghttp2_option_flag;

/**

/**
