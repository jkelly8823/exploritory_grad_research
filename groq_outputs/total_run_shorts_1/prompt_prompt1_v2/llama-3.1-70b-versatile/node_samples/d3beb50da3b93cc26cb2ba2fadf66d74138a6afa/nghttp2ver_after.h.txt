VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability detected in the code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet does not contain any user-controlled input that is used to execute dynamic operations, nor does it manipulate any execution context in an insecure way. The code is composed of constant macro definitions, which do not have runtime implications and therefore cannot be used as vectors for malicious code execution. 
The code snippet does not modify any critical state, perform any improper access control checks, open network connections, encrypt data insecurely, or perform any hashing operations that could be the target of a cryptanalysis attack.
The current analysis indicates that this file does not introduce any known security risks.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No fixes needed for the given code snippet.
