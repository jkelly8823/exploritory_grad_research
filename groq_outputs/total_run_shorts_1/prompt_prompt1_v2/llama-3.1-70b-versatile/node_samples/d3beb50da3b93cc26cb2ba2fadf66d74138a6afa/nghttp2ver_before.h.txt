VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: 
No detected vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a portion of a C macro definition for version information of the nghttp2 library. The code consists of simple definitions for version numbers using preprocessor macros. There are no evident vulnerabilities in this code snippet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations are needed for this code. The use of preprocessor macros is legitimate in this context, and the definitions do not pose any known risks.

* @macro
* Numerical representation of the version number of the nghttp2 library
* release. This is a 24 bit number with 8 bits for major number, 8 bits
* for minor and 8 bits for patch. Version 1.2.3 becomes 0x010203.
