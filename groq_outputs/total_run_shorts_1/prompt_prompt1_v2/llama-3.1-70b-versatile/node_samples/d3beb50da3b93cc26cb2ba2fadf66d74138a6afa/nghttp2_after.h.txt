VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a part of the NGHTTP2 library, specifically dealing with settings and options for HTTP/2 connections. The code defines some macros, error codes, and function prototypes. After careful analysis, I did not find any obvious vulnerabilities. The code seems to be implementing settings and options for HTTP/2 connections and does not contain any user input, pointer arithmetic, or other potentially vulnerable code. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
N/A
