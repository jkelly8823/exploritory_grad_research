VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 14
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference.

EXPLANATION:
The `stream` variable is checked for null before the `if (rv != 0)` statement. However, the null check comes after the stream is potentially utilized in the previous line. If the `stream` variable is null when `nghttp2_session_get_stream(session, stream_id)` is called, the function will attempt to use a null pointer without first checking its validity. Then it tries to check if `stream` is null.

However, the problem really starts on line 14, where even though `stream` has already been checked to be null earlier, there's a repeated null check after using `stream`. In cases where `stream` is null the previous null check `if (stream == NULL)` would have been triggered already and it will never reach to `if (rv != 0)` condition. In that case executing lines below that does not pose a problem. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Move the null check to the point right after `nghttp2_session_get_stream(session, stream_id)`. Add null checks before every use of the `stream` variable. This will help ensure that a null pointer is never dereferenced. Here is how the code should look like.

```c
stream = nghttp2_session_get_stream(session, stream_id);

if (stream == NULL) {
  return -1; // or any other suitable error code
}
```
or 
```c
if (stream != NULL) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
 
ORIGINAL CODE:

```c
    if (rv != 0) {
      return rv;
    }

    if (window_size_increment > 0) {
      return nghttp2_session_add_window_update(session, 0, stream_id,
                                               window_size_increment);
    }

    return nghttp2_session_update_recv_connection_window_size(session, 0);
  } else {
    stream = nghttp2_session_get_stream(session, stream_id);

    if (stream == NULL) {
    if (rv != 0) {
      return rv;
    }

    if (window_size_increment > 0) {
      return nghttp2_session_add_window_update(session, 0, stream_id,
                                               window_size_increment);
    }

    return nghttp2_session_update_recv_stream_window_size(session, stream, 0,
                                                          1);
  }

  return 0;
}
