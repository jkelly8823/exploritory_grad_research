VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerability found
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet is a set of function declarations, and no data handling or other potentially vulnerable actions are performed. These functions appear to be used for configuration and initialization purposes in a larger nghttp2 project. 
There is no apparent user input, no SQL interactions, no client-server data exchange, no caching concerns, no data deserialization or encryption involved.
No buffer overflows, race conditions, or deadlocks seem possible in this segment, given that they're just declarations.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are needed, as no vulnerability was found.
