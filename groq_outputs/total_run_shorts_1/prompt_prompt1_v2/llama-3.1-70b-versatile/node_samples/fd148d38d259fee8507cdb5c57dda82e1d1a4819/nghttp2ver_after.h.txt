```c
* @macro
* Version number of the nghttp2 library release
*/
#define NGHTTP2_VERSION "1.39.2"

/**
* @macro
* Numerical representation of the version number of the nghttp2 library
* release. This is a 24 bit number with 8 bits for major number, 8 bits
* for minor and 8 bits for patch. Version 1.2.3 becomes 0x010203.
