VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identifiable vulnerability found.
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It appears to be a header guard and a namespace closure, which are common practices in C++. The undefined macro `NODE_WANT_INTERNALS` and the namespace `node` do not indicate any security concerns. However, the code snippet seems incomplete, and the lines are cut off mid-expression. Despite this, no recognizable vulnerabilities have been identified.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
None applicable.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <locale>
#include "util.h"

// These are defined by <sys/byteorder.h> or <netinet/in.h> on some systems.
// To avoid warnings, undefine them before redefining them.
  return name_;
}

}  // namespace node

#endif  // defined(NODE_WANT_INTERNALS) && NODE_WANT_INTERNALS
