VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 11-12
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
The code is vulnerable to a Command Injection attack due to direct inclusion of user-provided data in the construction of a command.

EXPLANATION:
The `create` method in the `AutocannonBenchmarker` class takes an `options` object as an argument and constructs a command by appending user-provided data from the `options.headers` and `options.path` properties. This is vulnerable to Command Injection because an attacker can inject malicious data into the `options.headers` or `options.path` properties, which would be executed as part of the command.

For example, an attacker could provide a malicious `options.headers` object with a field name containing malicious data that would be executed as a command. Similarly, an attacker could provide a malicious `options.path` property that contains malicious data that would be executed as a command.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, the code should validate and sanitize any user-provided data before including it in the construction of the command. One way to do this is to use a white-listing approach to restrict the types of data that can be provided in the `options.headers` and `options.path` properties. Additionally, the code should use a safe method to construct the command, such as using a command builder library that can help prevent Command Injection attacks.

Example of how to fix the vulnerability:
```javascript
const sanitizedHeaders = {};
for (const field in options.headers) {
  const sanitizedField = sanitizeField(field);
  const sanitizedValue = sanitizeValue(options.headers[field]);
  sanitizedHeaders[sanitizedField] = sanitizedValue;
}
const args = [
  '-n',
];
for (const field in sanitizedHeaders) {
  args.push('-H', `${field}=${sanitizedHeaders[field]}`);
}
```
This example uses fictional `sanitizeField` and `sanitizeValue` functions to sanitize the user-provided data. You should replace these with actual sanitization logic suitable for your use case.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
class AutocannonBenchmarker {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'autocannon';
    this.executable =
      process.platform === 'win32' ? 'autocannon.cmd' : 'autocannon';
    const result = child_process.spawnSync(this.executable, ['-h']);
    this.present = !(result.error && result.error.code === 'ENOENT');
  }

  create(options) {
    const args = [
      '-n',
    ];
    for (const field in options.headers) {
      args.push('-H', `${field}=${options.headers[field]}`);
    }
    const scheme = options.scheme || 'http';
    args.push(`${scheme}://127.0.0.1:${options.port}${options.path}`);
    const child = child_process.spawn(this.executable, args);
    return child;
  }

  processResults(output) {
```
