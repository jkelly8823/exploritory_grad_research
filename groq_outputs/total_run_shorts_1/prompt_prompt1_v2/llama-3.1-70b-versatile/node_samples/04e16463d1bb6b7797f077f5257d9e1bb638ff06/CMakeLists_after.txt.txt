VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: None
EXPLANATION:
This code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities. It appears to be a CMake script setting up a project. The minimum CMake version is specified, along with a project version and some project settings.

The project uses the C standard version 99, which is somewhat outdated. However, this does not directly imply a vulnerability, as many projects may still use older versions for compatibility or other reasons.

The code snippet seems to be well-formed and does not contain any known security vulnerabilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
While not related to security, it would be a good practice to update the C standard version to a more modern one, such as C11 or C17, if compatible with the project's libraries and requirements.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)
cmake_policy(SET CMP0069 NEW)

project(llhttp VERSION 9.2.1)
include(GNUInstallDirs)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)
```
