EXPLANATION: 
This code segment appears to be a part of a larger C/C++ codebase, possibly the Node.js project. It defines constants and a macro using the `V` macro function. There are no evident security vulnerabilities in this code snippet. The usage of macros and constants in this code does not appear to introduce any potential security risks.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
No recommendations are necessary as no security vulnerabilities were identified in this code.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```c
V(napi_type_tag, "node:napi:type_tag")                                       \
V(napi_wrapper, "node:napi:wrapper")                                         \
V(untransferable_object_private_symbol, "node:untransferableObject")         \
V(exit_info_private_symbol, "node:exit_info_private_symbol")                 \
V(require_private_symbol, "node:require_private_symbol")

// Symbols are per-isolate primitives but Environment proxies them
// for the sake of convenience.
#define PER_ISOLATE_SYMBOL_PROPERTIES(V)                                       \
