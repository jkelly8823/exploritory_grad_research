VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be defining a set of macros and symbols for interaction with the Node.js API. I have analyzed the snippet and did not find any obvious security vulnerabilities.

The snippet seems to be focusing on defining and accessing certain symbols, but it does not demonstrate any insecure behavior, such as unvalidated input handling, use of potentially tainted data, or inappropriate resource access.

Given the context of a GitHub commit hunk and the lack of variable declarations or definitions, it's possible that the larger codebase may contain vulnerabilities. However, this specific snippet does not.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No specific recommendations can be made for this snippet, as it does not contain any apparent vulnerabilities. It's essential to review the entire codebase and perform additional testing to ensure the overall security of the application.

ORIGINAL CODE:

  V(napi_type_tag, "node:napi:type_tag")                                       \
  V(napi_wrapper, "node:napi:wrapper")                                         \
  V(untransferable_object_private_symbol, "node:untransferableObject")         \
  V(exit_info_private_symbol, "node:exit_info_private_symbol")

// Symbols are per-isolate primitives but Environment proxies them
// for the sake of convenience.
#define PER_ISOLATE_SYMBOL_PROPERTIES(V)
