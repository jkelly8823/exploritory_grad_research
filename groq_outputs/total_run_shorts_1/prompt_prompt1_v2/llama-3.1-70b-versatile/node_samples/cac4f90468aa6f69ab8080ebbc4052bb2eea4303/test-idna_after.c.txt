VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities detected in the provided code snippet.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be a part of a test implementation for UTF-8 decoding. It tests single-byte and multi-byte sequences. The test uses ASSERT_EQ statements to verify the expected behavior, and there are no obvious security vulnerabilities or errors in the provided code. The code seems well-structured, and there is no apparent misuse of functions or algorithms that could lead to security issues.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixes are needed in this code snippet, as no security vulnerabilities were detected.
ORIGINAL CODE:

  return 0;
}

TEST_IMPL(utf8_decode1_overrun) {
  const char* p;
  char b[1];

  /* Single byte. */
  p = b;
  b[0] = 0x7F;
  ASSERT_EQ(0x7F, uv__utf8_decode1(&p, b + 1));
  ASSERT_EQ(p, b + 1);

  /* Multi-byte. */
  p = b;
  b[0] = 0xC0;
  ASSERT_EQ((unsigned) -1, uv__utf8_decode1(&p, b + 1));
  ASSERT_EQ(p, b + 1);

  return 0;
}

/* Doesn't work on z/OS because that platform uses EBCDIC, not ASCII. */
