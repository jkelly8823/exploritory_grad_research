VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code snippet.

EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet appears to be a collection of test declarations and entries for a testing framework. The TEST_DECLARE and TEST_ENTRY macros are likely used to define and initialize test cases. There is no logic or functionality in this code snippet that could lead to a vulnerability.

However, there is a comment indicating that this code does not work on the z/OS platform due to the use of EBCDIC encoding instead of ASCII. This is not a vulnerability, but rather a platform-specific limitation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations are necessary for this code snippet, as no vulnerabilities were identified.

ORIGINAL CODE:


TEST_DECLARE  (idna_toascii)
TEST_DECLARE  (utf8_decode1)
TEST_DECLARE  (utf8_decode1_overrun)
TEST_DECLARE  (uname)

TEST_DECLARE  (metrics_idle_time)
TEST_DECLARE  (metrics_idle_time_thread)
#endif

  TEST_ENTRY  (utf8_decode1)
  TEST_ENTRY  (utf8_decode1_overrun)
  TEST_ENTRY  (uname)

/* Doesn't work on z/OS because that platform uses EBCDIC, not ASCII. */
