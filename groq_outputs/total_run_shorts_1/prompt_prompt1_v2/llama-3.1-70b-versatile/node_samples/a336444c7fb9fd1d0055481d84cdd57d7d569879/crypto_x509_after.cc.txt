VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Insecure Certificate Validation
EXPLANATION:
This segment of code does not suggest a specific vulnerability on its own but as X509ToObject function is often used to parse a certificate to allow certificate validation. No code is present for handling potential certificate validation errors which could lead to insecure certificate validation. Given proper input from other functions there may exist potential certificate validation issues within this certificate verification process as it does appear to verify existence of a valid certificate on an X509 object, however if used maliciously, there is room for vulnerability as missing checks may be elsewhere within the certificate parsing logic.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
In the X509Certificate handling, ensure certificate validation is always included. Check validity of any X509 objects prior to proceeding with its certification info to prevent any breaches on authentications. Assign additional checks to validate X509 objects, only when fully validated it should return parsed certificate.


ORIGINAL CODE:
```c++
  X509Certificate* cert;
  ASSIGN_OR_RETURN_UNWRAP(&cert, args.Holder());
  Local<Value> ret;
  if (X509ToObject(env, cert->get(), true).ToLocal(&ret))
    args.GetReturnValue().Set(ret);
}

void X509Certificate::GetIssuerCert(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {
