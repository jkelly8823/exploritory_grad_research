VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No security vulnerabilities identified.
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided is a C++ function declaration and seems to be a part of a larger library or module. The functions appear to handle certificates and their validity. There are no signs of any vulnerability in this snippet. The memory management seems to be handled properly by using smart pointers (MaybeLocal), and there is no indication of any input validation issues, command injection, or cross-site scripting.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
There are no recommended fixes, as no security vulnerabilities were identified.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Object> X509ToObject(
    Environment* env,
    X509* cert,
    bool names_as_string = false);

v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Value> GetValidTo(
    Environment* env,
    X509* cert,
