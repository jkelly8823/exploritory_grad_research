VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
Directory Traversal Vulnerability

EXPLANATION:
The code uses the `writeFileSync` function with a dynamically generated filename, `./info-${i}-cert.pem`. This filename is constructed by concatenating the string `./info-`, the value of `i`, and the string `-cert.pem`. This pattern is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks if the value of `i` comes from an untrusted source. An attacker could potentially manipulate the value of `i` to include relative path traversal sequences, such as `..`, to access and overwrite files in parent directories or other sensitive locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix this vulnerability, ensure that the value of `i` is sanitized and validated before using it to construct the filename. You can use techniques such as:

1.  **Validation:** Verify that `i` is a valid and expected value.
2.  **Encoding:** Use encoding mechanisms to remove or neutralize relative path traversal sequences.
3.  **Constant Prefix:** Use a constant and safe prefix to prevent directory traversal.
4.  **Secure File Paths:** Use libraries that provide secure file path generation and normalization.

Consider using a library that provides secure file I/O operations to avoid such vulnerabilities.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
  });
  writeFileSync(`./info-${i}-cert.pem`, `${pem}\n`);
}
