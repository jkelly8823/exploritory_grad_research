VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No vulnerability found.

EXPLANATION:
The code snippet appears to be part of a C++ function declaration for an X.509 certificate parser. It defines two function prototypes, `X509ToObject` and `GetValidTo`, which take `Environment*` and `X509*` as parameters and return `v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Object>` and `v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Value>` respectively. After analyzing the code, no potential vulnerabilities were found.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
None

ORIGINAL CODE:
```cpp
v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Object> X509ToObject(
    Environment* env,
    X509* cert);

v8::MaybeLocal<v8::Value> GetValidTo(
    Environment* env,
    X509* cert,
```
