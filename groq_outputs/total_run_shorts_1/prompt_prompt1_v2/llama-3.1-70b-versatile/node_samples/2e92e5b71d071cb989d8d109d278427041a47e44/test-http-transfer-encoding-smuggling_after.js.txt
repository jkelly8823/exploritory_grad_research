VULNERABLE: YES
VULNERABLE_LINES: 3-17, 28-44
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability due to deficient handling of Transfer-Encoding header.

EXPLANATION:
The given code snippet contains two examples of HTTP request handling. In both cases, the server does not properly validate the `Transfer-Encoding` header. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request with a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header followed by a second request. This allows the attacker to bypass access controls and inject arbitrary requests into the system. 

In the first example (lines 3-17), the server sends a `400 Bad Request` response back to the client when it encounters a duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` header. However, this error handling does not prevent the attack. 

In the second example (lines 28-44), the server calls the provided request handler function when it encounters a duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` header. However, the server does not properly validate the request method, path, or headers after the `Transfer-Encoding` header, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary requests into the system.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
To fix these vulnerabilities, the server should properly validate the `Transfer-Encoding` header and ensure that only one request is processed per connection. Here are some steps to fix the vulnerabilities:

- Remove or reject requests with duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
- Properly handle requests with empty `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
- Implement robust validation of the request method, path, and headers to prevent unauthorized access.
- Ensure that only one request is processed per connection to prevent request smuggling attacks.
