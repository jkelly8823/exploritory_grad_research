VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
None
EXPLANATION:
The code snippet provided appears to be a test or assertion code for a cryptographic function. It checks for expected behaviors when encountering invalid inputs or specific version of OpenSSL. No apparent vulnerabilities were detected in this code snippet.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities are needed in this case. However, as a general practice, it is always a good idea to keep cryptography libraries and their dependencies up to date to ensure the latest security patches are applied.

ORIGINAL CODE:
```

  const v = crypto.constants.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER;
  const hasOpenSSL3WithNewErrorMessage = (v >= 0x300000c0 && v <= 0x30100000) || (v >= 0x30100040 && v <= 0x30200000);
  assert.throws(() => {
    dh3.computeSecret('');

    'Supplied key is too small' });

// Through a fluke of history, g=0 defaults to DH_GENERATOR (2).
