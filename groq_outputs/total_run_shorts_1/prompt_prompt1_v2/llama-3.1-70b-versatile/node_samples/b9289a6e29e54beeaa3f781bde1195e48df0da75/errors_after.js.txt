VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION: No vulnerabilities detected
EXPLANATION:
The provided code snippet defines custom error messages and their corresponding types. It uses a function `E` (likely a custom function or a wrapper around a function) to register these errors. The code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure deserialization. The use of string formatting with error messages also does not pose a risk of format string vulnerabilities, as the format specifiers seem to be properly used.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
No recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities, as none were detected. However, it is recommended to validate the user input for `msg`, `permission`, and `resource` variables when they are assigned to prevent malicious data from being stored or processed.
ORIGINAL CODE:
```javascript
// Note: Node.js specific errors must begin with the prefix ERR_

E('ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
  function(msg, permission = '', resource = '') {
    this.permission = permission;
    this.resource = resource;
    return msg;
  },
  Error);
E('ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT', 'The "%s" argument is ambiguous. %s', TypeError);
E('ERR_ARG_NOT_ITERABLE', '%s must be iterable', TypeError);
E('ERR_ASSERTION', '%s', Error);
