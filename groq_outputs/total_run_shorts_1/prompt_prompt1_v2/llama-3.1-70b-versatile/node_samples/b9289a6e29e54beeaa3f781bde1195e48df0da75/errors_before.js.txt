VULNERABLE: NO
VULNERABLE_LINES: None
VULNERABILITY_DESCRIPTION:
No identified vulnerabilities.

EXPLANATION:
This code snippet appears to be a list of error definitions, specifically for a Node.js environment. It uses the function `E` to define and initialize errors with custom messages. The function takes three arguments: the error name, the error message, and the error type. Upon review, this code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or arbitrary file inclusion. The input values to the error messages are not coming from any untrusted sources that could cause security issues.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since this code snippet does not appear to contain any vulnerabilities, there are no recommended changes.
